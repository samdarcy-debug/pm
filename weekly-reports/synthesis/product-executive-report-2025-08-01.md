# **📊 Appendix**

### **Individual Team Reports**

# **Product DAI Team Executive Roundup - July 28 - August 1, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

GTM Studio September launch faces risk without leadership intervention. While the team achieved 70% goal completion with strong momentum on visual refresh, PMM automation, and data platform alignment, the convergence of multiple technical dependencies creates a high-probability failure scenario for September GA. The AI pricing disconnect remains unresolved and would cause launch failure if not addressed immediately. Action required: Dominik must personally own the pricing resolution and September scope lockdown to protect Q4 revenue targets.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

GTM Studio Sales Momentum Building: Darrell\'s external roadmap and deck iterations with sales teams generated strong validation signals. IC sellers provided specific, actionable feedback---rejecting the first slide, requesting shorter format, and confirming they\'ll customize slides for client narratives. Beta testing with Lazer\'s team for personalized roadmap agent showed promise, reducing manual roadmap creation from 2-3 weeks to 1-3 days despite presentation polish gaps.

Visual Refresh Foundation Delivered: Meghan\'s team established directional alignment on CopilotPro profile functionality and navigation design, with working demo preparation on track for August 11th leadership presentation. Three visual refresh concepts shared with leadership created shared vision for modern, unified experience across GTM Studio and CopilotPro platforms.

Data Platform Architecture Breakthrough: Ali secured engineering alignment on query/search approach after resolving communication silos between Majid and Imesh\'s teams. October Phase 1 delivery timeline established for scalable data sets integration, with Majid owning end-to-end architecture and weekly review cadence implemented to prevent duplicate work.

### **Goals & Progress**

Infrastructure & Platform: Adam made limited progress (30%) on inference proxy stability due to competing priorities including urgent AI pricing modeling work. Critical blocker remains for August 11th demo preparation as Ryan Stevens identified \"hope is not a strategy\" for technical convergence. Victor achieved 50% completion on unified CopilotPro experience definition, establishing preliminary aha moments list requiring PM alignment before design execution.

Product Marketing & Positioning: Mixed execution on critical positioning assets. PMM automation goals not achieved due to complexity requiring \"micro-agents\" customization rather than simple automation. Roadmap agent automation needs architectural decision between Python script, agent framework, or future knowledge graph approach. Brett and AJ progressed knowledge graph MVP with validated outputs, though full automation remains weeks away.

Data & Analytics: Brandon completed 100% of partnership operational process goals, establishing specialized procurement resource and flexible deal desk for flywheel partners. Strong progress on custom dataset development with contractor cube showing exceptional data quality. Brahm achieved 50% completion on GTM plays scope definition while managing team transitions and capacity constraints.

### **Strategic Challenges**

September GTM Studio Risk Escalation: Multiple engineering dependencies converging simultaneously without clear integration testing timeline. Early access program onboarding shifted from intensive training to simplified use cases due to product complexity concerns. Dominik flagged this as \"high risk\" requiring immediate scope clarification and potential timeline adjustment to prevent market launch failure.

AI Pricing Fundamental Disconnect: Revenue team positioning AI as negligible-cost utility conflicts with value-based positioning strategy. Mark Harris pushing credit-based model with minimal margins to avoid value articulation, while engineering team spent 6-8 hours on pricing iterations. This philosophical disconnect would cause go-to-market execution failure requiring top-down resolution.

Resource Allocation Without Planning: Teams operating in parallel without convergence strategy, creating duplicate work across data sets, search/query approaches, and plays architecture. Engineering teams building toward September demos while lacking confirmed resource allocation for post-demo development cycles.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

PMM Automation Reality Check: Marketing automation requires sophisticated \"micro-agents\" approach rather than simple prompt deployment. Team discovered that while content generation improved significantly (75-80% quality), human refinement and prompt iteration remain highly manual processes. This impacts timeline expectations for scaling product marketing outputs across vertical datasets and GTM Studio launch materials.

Customer Experience Complexity Gap: Technical capabilities development outpacing user experience design. Jagan feedback highlighted \"tech out\" feeling where customers must understand system architecture (data persistence decisions, enrichment timing) rather than focusing on business outcomes. This suggests need for additional UX cycles before demo-ready state.

Sales Team Adoption Patterns: IC seller feedback revealed predictable customization behavior---teams will select preferred slides rather than using complete decks. This validates personalization-first approach for PMM automation while highlighting need for modular asset architecture supporting rapid customization rather than static deliverables.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with platform engineering teams on inference proxy stability remains critical for August 11th demo success. Ryan Stevens and devops team commitment needed for short-term fallback solution while long-term prompt service architecture develops. Current direct model vendor relationships create scalability and reliability risks that could impact customer-facing demonstrations.

Integration and connectors team support essential for GTM Studio early access program execution. Customer onboarding depends heavily on data connectivity and export functionality, with Hubspot opportunity data issues creating specific blockers for ROI analytics demonstration capabilities.

### **Looking Ahead**

Ruthless prioritization must replace hope-driven execution. August 11th demo with Henry requires surgical focus on deliverable proof points rather than aspirational roadmap items. Ryan Stevens\' \"Tuesday test\" principle applies---features not working well by Tuesday won\'t work for Friday demo.

September launch success demands immediate scope lockdown and resource confirmation. Current trajectory suggests October timeline more realistic for quality delivery. Team must choose between September release with reduced scope or October release with full capability set. Data platform delivery, early access program validation, and pricing model resolution represent three critical path items requiring executive decision-making this week.

GTM Studio market momentum depends on sales team confidence and customer success stories. Early access program transition from intensive training to simplified use cases indicates product complexity concerns that could impact field adoption. Customer champion network development across CSM, AM, and solution consulting teams essential for avoiding internal capability proliferation and ensuring unified go-to-market approach.

# **GTM Studio Team Executive Roundup - July 28, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**GTM Studio September GA is locked and loaded.** Engineering milestones are finalized and committed, with key foundational pieces like Plays architecture alignment, signal-based workbooks design completion, and AI audience building capabilities all converging toward our September launch. The cross-functional coordination between Platform (Workflows) and GTM Studio (Play wrapper objects) has been resolved, creating a clear path forward for execution. Early Access customers like Brex are providing strong validation signals, while ROI Analytics moves toward GA readiness with 8-10 customer-driven enhancements identified.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Plays Architecture Progress**: Veronica, Carlos Nunez, Ali Sadat, Marc Frail, Noam, and Imesh achieved critical alignment on Tuesday, getting closer to resolving the platform vs app definition confusion that had been creating friction. Platform will fully own Workflows execution, while GTM Studio owns the wrapper object connecting Workflows to Workbooks, reporting, and state management. Getting closer to architectural clarity removes a major blocker and enables parallel development streams.

**Signal-Based Workbooks Foundation Complete**: Tanvi Vaidya delivered 100% completion on establishing design and requirements framework, with Figma designs ready for Monday engineering review. Internal feedback revealed users need aggregated views from initial release rather than raw data alone, fundamentally shaping our approach to data presentation strategy and ensuring higher user adoption from launch.

**Customer Validation Accelerating**: Jagannath Ramesh reports Brex providing positive feedback on Workbooks core use cases, with growing demand for additional team training highlighting the product\'s value expansion potential. The AI audience building capabilities now support enrichment across ZI fields and CRM data within artifacts, demonstrating meaningful progress toward GA readiness.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Plays Development**: Architecture alignment achieved with 80% goal completion by Veronica Hudson. PRD refinement continues with Carlos Nunez on engineering proposal/scoping, while Neha Pareek reached 90% completion on triggers/actions mapping, creating prioritized P1 events list and cross-team coordination structure with Workflows, Scoring, and Agentic teams.

**ROI Analytics GA Preparation**: Brahm Kohli identified 8-10 customer-driven enhancements critical for GA readiness, though progress sits at 50% due to HubSpot opportunity data health issues requiring Platform/Integrations support. Arun V advanced edge case handling with 15+ scenarios addressed, while ROI Analytics BETA program summary awaits final review with Dominik and James Roth.

**AI Data Management Strategy**: Ash Lauricella achieved 85% completion incorporating stakeholder feedback from Brandon Tucker, Anne Fajkus, Vinny Parisi, and Coleman into prototype iterations. Usage definitions aligned with analytics engineering team, with steel thread narratives resonating strongly with internal stakeholders despite needing clearer definition of AI magic vs user control balance.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Navigation Release Delayed to September**: The comprehensive new navigation rollout for SalesOS, Marketing, and Copilot customers requires more extensive enablement preparation than initially scoped. Neha Pareek reports the Enablement team needs additional time for cross-functional coordination affecting all customer segments, highlighting our tendency to underestimate multi-product impact scope.

**Integration Dependencies Creating Bottlenecks**: Multiple workstreams face integration complexity. Mohan Sun discovered Hasura GraphQL layer issues pushing Partner Data query API to end of October, while HubSpot opportunity data health problems block ROI Analytics progress for affected customers. These technical dependencies require more Platform/Integrations engineering support than currently allocated.

**Resource Allocation Across Expanding Scope**: With GTM Studio GA approaching, team members are juggling multiple high-priority initiatives. Brahm Kohli needs clearer PM capacity allocation for GTM Data Management, while Tanvi Vaidya deferred bug backlog cleanup to focus on core GA deliverables, indicating potential technical debt accumulation as we prioritize launch readiness.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Platform Integration Complexity Underestimated**: Our Partner Data initiative revealed significant architectural challenges with Hasura not functioning as expected for GraphQL layer support. Corina Soto\'s team learned this is expected for first-time platform builds across ZDP, APIs, and Query Builder, but standardizing the approach will enable scaling for all future partner data integrations.

**User Experience Expectations Higher Than Anticipated**: Tanvi Vaidya\'s signal-based workbooks research showed users need aggregated views immediately rather than accepting raw data presentation. This insight challenges our assumption about progressive capability release and suggests users expect sophisticated data manipulation from day one, influencing our entire data presentation strategy.

**Customer Success Driving Feature Expansion**: Jagannath Ramesh observed Brex and other Early Access customers requesting additional team training, indicating Workbooks\' value extends beyond individual users to team-wide adoption patterns. This suggests our go-to-market approach should emphasize organizational capability building rather than individual user onboarding.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our coordination with Platform team on Workflows execution continues to be critical for Plays success. Marc Frail\'s team owns the underlying workflow engine while we manage the business logic layer, requiring ongoing technical alignment on triggers, actions, and data flow. The Tuesday architecture meeting resolved ownership questions, but implementation details need continued collaboration.

Integration engineering support has become a bottleneck across multiple initiatives. Both ROI Analytics (HubSpot data health) and Partner Data (query API delays) require more Platform team bandwidth than currently available, potentially impacting our September GA timeline if not addressed through resource reallocation or priority adjustment.

### **Looking Ahead**

**September GA execution is our singular focus**, with engineering milestones committed and clear delivery paths established across all major workstreams.

**Top priorities center on execution quality over feature expansion**. Veronica will finalize the Plays PRD (with a review being scheduled for the week of 8/11) and architecture proposal with Carlos Nunez, while Tanvi moves signal-based workbooks through design review and engineering validation. Brahm needs immediate Platform support resolution for ROI Analytics blockers, and Ash will complete AI Data Management prototype validation with recorded demos and business case prioritization. Each workstream has clear next steps and identified collaborators, with the biggest risk being integration engineering bandwidth constraints that require leadership attention for resource allocation adjustments.

**The convergence of customer validation, technical foundation completion, and cross-team alignment positions us strongly for September delivery**, assuming we can resolve Platform dependencies and maintain execution discipline across all parallel development streams.

# **SalesOS/Copilot Executive Roundup - July 28 - 31, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Victor Oliveros has identified the critical need to ensure Copilot v2 delivers market-leapfrogging \"wow moments\" beyond what competitors offer, as the current trajectory puts us only at market parity by November launch. Gabe Pirela achieved 80% completion on AI emailer requirements handoff and conversation intelligence enablement, while Adam Severance made significant progress on onboarding journeys and launch readiness. The team successfully completed 100% of LRT processes for August releases including intent recommendation features targeting 12,000-30,000 customers, but faces a critical entitlement clash issue blocking copilot upsells that requires immediate resolution.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Gabe Pirela successfully documented detailed AI emailer requirements and aligned with engineering teams (Tomer) and design (Sarah) on implementation approach, positioning the team for a critical August 11th demo showcase. His conversation intelligence work progressed to 80% completion with marketing materials created and beta customers identified for early access testing next week.

Adam Severance finalized the rollout strategy for Launch Copilot experience through direct partnership with Mary\'s onboarding team, establishing a sustainable process of several accounts per week with clear enterprise criteria. His work through the AI product marketing engine yielded impressive results and high-fidelity user journey logic trees that identify strong \"aha moments\" for SDR/BDR personas.

Ant Cuomo completed his initial product review on dynamic company profiles with Victor, delivering solid research direction and validation insights from internal ZI chat usage analysis. His comprehensive weekend prototyping work established clear foundations for both current SalesOS integration and future Copilot v2 positioning across unified user experiences.

### **Goals & Progress**

AI & Automation Development: Gabe Pirela achieved 80% completion on AI emailer tactical requirements with engineering handoff scheduled and conversation intelligence enablement progressing through beta customer identification for next week testing. Adam Severance advanced Day 1 agent prototype development by 60% using ZI chatbot infrastructure, though faced complexity in accounting for CRM versus non-CRM user paths that requires additional logic refinement.

Hari Krishnamoorthy achieved 100% completion of LRT processes for August month releases including intent recommendation, AFS download functionality, and enhanced audit trail features targeting both copilot and marketing voice customers.

Technical Infrastructure & Integration: David Goulden made 60% progress on priority accounts GTM data model dependencies despite key engineering resources being on vacation, while advancing admin defined territories to 99% completion for end-user explainability in staging. Ant Cuomo progressed 50% on extension overhaul PRD development and tactical planning for reach-out functionality expansion to support the 50% of customers without CRM integration.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Victor Oliveros identified the fundamental challenge that current Copilot v2 development trajectory will achieve market parity rather than market leadership by November launch, requiring immediate strategic pivoting toward distinctive \"wow moments\" that differentiate from competitors like People AI, Salesforce, and Scratchpad. The team needs crisp identification of these breakthrough features with design mockups by end of next week to address this strategic gap.

Al Nevarez encountered a months-old entitlement clash issue that blocks efficient copilot upsells when existing customers upgrade packages, causing customer complaints about promised features (500 topics) not being delivered due to legacy entitlement conflicts (stuck at 12 topics). This technical debt requires mediation between two engineering teams with different solution approaches and affects future workbook launches.

David Goulden faces significant uncertainty around GTM data model integration with classic Advanced Search, where nobody understands potential breaking changes or impacts on existing CRM filters, saved searches, intent features, and alerts functionality. Key architectural decisions require coordination across multiple engineering teams with unclear ownership boundaries and timeline dependencies.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Victor Oliveros discovered that market differentiation requires focusing on \"aha moments relative to the market\" rather than just improvements over SalesOS, as competitor analysis reveals widespread adoption of similar sheet-like interfaces and default sales team positioning. The team\'s unique advantage lies in proprietary contact and lead data access, but this requires better integration into user workflows to create tangible competitive moats.

Gabe Pirela learned that autonomous agent capabilities and \"human in the loop\" functionality represent emerging market expectations, with strategic opportunities to implement selective automation for specific use cases rather than wholesale interface replacement. Market trends indicate 6-12 month leadership over current user expectations, creating a window for thoughtful implementation of autonomous features where they add genuine value.

The team validated that retention and adoption plays for current SalesOS and Copilot v1 customers will drive the biggest immediate business impact for this year\'s growth targets, while simultaneously building toward v2 capabilities. This dual-track approach balances short-term revenue protection with long-term strategic positioning, particularly critical given enterprise customers\' tendency toward muscle memory and delayed feature adoption.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the GTM data model team continues to be critical for unlocking priority accounts functionality based on CRM matching. David Goulden requires immediate coordination with core search architects and the platform team to resolve integration uncertainties and establish clear engineering ownership boundaries for Q3 deliverables while planning Q4 custom fields capabilities.

Al Nevarez needs urgent support from entitlement operations and engineering teams to resolve the intent topic clash issue that blocks copilot upsells and threatens customer satisfaction. Frank Drake\'s involvement as director of applications engineering provides the necessary technical authority to establish proper staging environments and validate solutions before production deployment.

### **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on crystallizing Copilot v2\'s market-differentiated vision through collaborative design sessions between Victor Oliveros, the PM team, and Shawn\'s design organization to identify and mock up the top 5 breakthrough \"wow moments\" that will leapfrog competitor offerings rather than simply match them.

The team will execute critical handoffs including Gabe Pirela\'s AI emailer to engineering for August 11th demo preparation, Adam Severance\'s onboarding journey finalization with design kickoff, and resolution of Al Nevarez\'s entitlement clash through Frank Drake\'s staging environment reconstruction. David Goulden will leverage returning key personnel (Harsha) to advance GTM data model integration planning while Ant Cuomo begins design collaboration on dynamic profiles and extension overhaul integration.

Success depends on balancing immediate customer needs through current product enhancements with breakthrough innovation that positions Copilot v2 as the definitive market leader, supported by strong execution on August release commitments and resolution of technical blockers that could impact customer upsell opportunities and satisfaction.

# **Data Team Executive Roundup - July 28-31, 2025**

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Partnership Operations Breakthrough: Brandon Tucker delivered a streamlined operational process for ecosystem partnerships, working directly with procurement and legal teams to create a dedicated deal desk. This addresses the critical 6+ week delay that was burning partnerships with smaller businesses and CEOs who couldn\'t navigate our traditional vendor processes. We now have a single point of contact in procurement and simplified legal requirements for data partnerships.

Data Infrastructure Scale Achievement: Dana Hurtig\'s team completed knowledge transfer and testing for the DIP platform, enabling us to process 1.1M Latin American companies from the Rhetorik dataset. This represents our first major company infusion capability that will unlock millions of contacts in strategic markets. The WDA team is scheduled to crawl for vitality and descriptions early next week, with the first production run planned by week\'s end.

Signal Enhancement Momentum: Brandon Wilson achieved significant improvements to the Won Deal Similar Account signal based on extensive feedback from sales teams. The enhanced signal now provides clearer value proposition explanations and better account similarity reasoning, with multiple iterations already deployed for internal review. This semantic data integration represents a major step forward in signal relevancy and actionability.

### **Goals & Progress**

User-Level Signal Relevance: Steve Hutchinson\'s analysis confirmed that Contact Recommender integration could deliver 24% lift in person-based signals for tenants, representing contacts not currently captured in Person of Interest or Buying Committee models. The team has scheduled cross-functional meetings with data science to determine optimal implementation approach, whether through user-level POI integration or downstream caching strategies.

Vertical Dataset Framework: Dow Jones completed the critical value framework document for vertical datasets, working with Brett and Jen to establish consistent positioning across all future dataset releases. This foundational approach will enable scalable sales processes rather than requiring distinct approaches for each of the 12+ datasets planned for the next 6-12 months. The framework was successfully tested in a customer meeting and showed immediate improvement in conversation quality.

Compliance & Risk Management: Rob Priore completed the monthly cookie audit across 21 domains, identifying new compliance violations and escalating the critical issue where cookies fail to load upon landing. This technical problem may be significantly limiting marketing effectiveness, and OneTrust has been engaged for vendor review of Google Tag Manager settings. Additionally, swapper.exe certificate issues are creating customer concerns about malware, requiring immediate attention.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Email Validation Compliance Conflict: The California and Oregon privacy law requirements to remove email validation for opt-out requests creates significant risk exposure. While George Jones agrees we shouldn\'t remove the control, legal ambiguity remains around implementation. Without email validation, bad actors could potentially harvest emails or conduct mass opt-out campaigns against key contacts in these jurisdictions. Rob Priore is working with Hannah to develop a generic response system with secondary confirmation, but this remains a critical vulnerability that could impact data quality across our highest-value regions.

Technical Infrastructure Dependencies: Multiple teams are experiencing delays due to backend complexity in admin panels and data access requirements. The CN Admin Panel updates are blocked due to disparate ownership and maintenance issues, while Steve Hutchinson\'s team needs Xverum member data in ZDP to advance the facilitators model. These technical dependencies are creating cascading delays across signal enhancement and data quality initiatives.

Resource Allocation Pressure: Analysis resources are stretched thin across competing priorities, with Ethan Young and Jody Roberts both flagging capacity constraints. The definition of company work, technographic backlog elimination, and H2 roadmap planning are all competing for limited analytical bandwidth. This resource constraint is particularly impacting customer-facing initiatives and strategic planning efforts.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Partnership Process Transformation: Our discovery that 50-question security reviews for simple CSV data transfers was overwhelming potential partners revealed a fundamental misalignment between our procurement processes and partnership reality. Small businesses and CEOs were abandoning partnerships due to process burden rather than commercial disagreement. The new deal desk approach recognizes that data partnerships carry different risk profiles than infrastructure purchases and require partnership-oriented rather than vendor-purchaser frameworks.

Semantic Data Signal Enhancement: Brandon Wilson\'s iterative work on the Won Deal Similar Account signal demonstrated that semantic data integration requires extensive refinement to deliver actionable insights. The feedback loop with account managers revealed that signal explanations and similarity reasoning are as important as the underlying recommendations. This learning will inform how we approach the New Rep signal and other semantic data applications.

Data Quality Automation Opportunities: Dana Hurtig\'s team achieved 5x efficiency improvements in conference automation and successfully implemented EMS automation in production. The IPO contacts automation and 160K junk CxO profile cleanup demonstrate that AI-driven automation can deliver both efficiency gains and quality improvements simultaneously. This validates our strategic direction toward automated data quality management.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the WDA team on Rhetorik data crawling remains critical for the Latin American expansion initiative. Dana Hurtig has scheduled vitality and description crawling for next week, with the engineering team providing necessary platform support. Any delays in this crawling work will directly impact our ability to deliver the promised contact coverage for Oracle, Uber, and Salesforce.

The relationship with the data science team is becoming increasingly important for Contact Recommender integration and user-level POI development. Steve Hutchinson\'s analysis shows significant signal lift potential, but implementation requires careful coordination on API limitations, caching strategies, and potential feedback loop risks from amplitude data that includes co-pilot views.

### **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s Vancouver onsite will focus on vertical dataset processes, production integration, and GTM enablement strategies. This represents a critical alignment opportunity as we scale from individual dataset launches to systematic vertical data capability.

Our immediate priorities center on executing the first DIP company infusion run while simultaneously advancing the restaurant dataset toward its August 11th launch target. The restaurant dataset GTM materials must reach go-to-market teams well before launch to enable proper enablement and preparation. Brandon Wilson will continue iterating on the New Rep signal to complement the enhanced Won Deal signal, creating a comprehensive semantic data signal suite.

# **Integrations Team Executive Roundup - July 28 - August 1, 2025**

## **Bottom Line:**

Prateek Paikray delivered a successful Salesforce Agentforce demo that impressed the Salesforce team and is ready for security review. Sanyog Rai resolved last week\'s Engagement migration issues and collaborated with Andres Perez to get Guy Grinburg assigned as an overall Engagement architect to ensure northstar alignment across Imesh, Nebo, and Majed engineering orgs. Erica Fienman is navigating evolving Copilot v2 requirements with an August 18th deadline while delivering on GTM custom field population and more advanced CRM normalization such as Account Custom fields into Account Team Role records.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Salesforce Agentforce Package Ready for Launch: Prateek Paikray completed the Salesforce Agentforce package development and delivered a compelling demo to the Salesforce team that was well-received. The package is now in final testing phase with documentation being prepared for security review submission, positioning ZoomInfo to capture early market share in the Salesforce AI ecosystem and demonstrating our platform-level partnership execution capabilities.

GTM Data Model Infrastructure Breakthrough: Sanyog Rai successfully deployed email and calendar data to production GTM Store for specific tenants, achieving 85% completion on the engagement tables infrastructure. While last weeks issues were resolved, new issues with stale data on GTM Store staging became a blocker at end of week and await resolve once the right folks are available early next week. ZoomInfo\'s email and calendar data expected to be ingested next week barring additional unforeseen blockers.

Dataset Marketplace Design Advancement: Prateek Paikray finalized designs for the GTM Studio third-party dataset marketplace and aligned with Ali, Dow, and Linda on project ownership for the aggressive October timeline. This initiative will enable GTM Studio users to explore and enrich workbook datasets with external data sources, providing competitive differentiation against tools like Scratchpad.

### **Goals & Progress**

Copilot v2 Requirements Alignment: Erica Fienman worked with Sean to refine scope for the August 18th milestone deadline, navigating evolving requirements while balancing existing Q3 commitments. The team has scheduled engineering review for Monday to finalize commitment levels, with particular focus on capabilities like opportunity creation/updates and sub-30-second CRM export functionality that don\'t currently exist in the platform.

Engagement ID Framework Resolution: Sanyog Rai resolved the engagement ID consistency challenge by developing a framework that uses source plus unique ID combinations, maintaining universal uniqueness across providers even when some (like Chorus) only provide meeting URLs rather than API-generated identifiers. This solution ensures downstream system compatibility while supporting both API-sourced and generated identifiers.

Partner Integration API Progress: The upsert API for content interactions continues progressing as expected, enabling testing with alpha partners including Crossbeam, Madison Logic, Pathfactory, and Partnerstack. This foundational capability supports the broader engagement architecture while providing immediate value for partner integrations and competitive positioning.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Multi-Timezone Infrastructure Coordination: Sanyog Rai continues facing a recurring pattern where each week brings new unknown technical issues requiring coordination between three different engineering teams across multiple timezones. The challenge isn\'t just competing priorities, but the discovery of new integration points and dependencies that weren\'t apparent until testing, creating unpredictable delays as teams in different regions work through ingestion, orchestration, and storage layer issues sequentially.

Enterprise Customer Privacy Concerns: The team identified that enterprise integration friction stems from customers seeing engagement data in the product that they wouldn\'t have chosen to include, particularly executive and board member communications. Sanyog Rai will investigate implementing an agent-based solution that automatically queries ZoomInfo\'s leadership data for customer domains and adds C-suite and board members to ignore and block lists during tenant provisioning, preventing privacy concerns before they arise.

Copilot v2 Timeline Pressure: Erica Fienman faces evolving requirements for the August 18th milestone with limited engineering review time before the sprint begins Sunday. The scope includes capabilities like real-time CRM exports and opportunity management that require platform-level development, creating tension between the aggressive timeline and existing Q3 commitments including dynamic mapping custom field work.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

GraphQL API Paradigm Shift: The team discovered that the new GraphQL API provides a single endpoint to query anything in GTM Store, being metadata-driven for faster development and eliminating the need for multiple specific endpoints. However, this creates overlap with existing REST APIs and requires careful consideration of scopes, partner access controls, and customer experience consistency as we potentially expose this powerful querying capability publicly.

Real-Time Export Feedback Loop Opportunity: Customer feedback from a Snowflake SDR revealed that export success visibility remains a pain point, with users struggling to determine what exported successfully. Erica Fienman\'s work on near real-time CRM import capabilities (within 30 seconds to 1 minute) could provide immediate feedback loops, reducing reliance on workflow reporting and improving user confidence in the export process.

Dynamic Mapping Unique ID Complexity: Erica Fienman identified that the dynamic mapping feature requires careful unique ID construction using object.field API names to maintain uniqueness across different relationship types (owner, CSM overlay, etc.) and handle scenarios where the same person holds multiple roles. This technical insight ensures data integrity as CRM assignments change over time.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Sanyog Rai\'s engagement infrastructure work requires ongoing coordination with Jerome\'s team on matching logic and Maxim\'s team on ETL processes, with the newly assigned architect Guy helping coordinate these dependencies. The challenge remains that all teams are building interconnected new systems simultaneously across different timezones, creating stability challenges that require ongoing executive attention to resource prioritization.

Prateek Paikray\'s Dataset Marketplace initiative requires close coordination with Ali\'s data team and Linda\'s workbook team, with Majid serving as the technical architect. The aggressive October timeline demands clear ownership boundaries and consistent prioritization across all three teams to avoid the coordination delays experienced in other cross-functional initiatives.

### **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on converting architectural clarity into executable implementation plans while maintaining momentum on customer-facing deliverables across all team members\' initiatives.

The top priorities include Erica Fienman finalizing Copilot v2 scope with engineering review on Monday to meet the August 18th deadline, Sanyog Rai continuing GTM Store production deployment while managing multi-timezone coordination challenges, and Prateek Paikray advancing both the Salesforce Agentforce security review submission and Dataset Marketplace technical planning with Majid. Success depends on maintaining clear communication across timezone boundaries while ensuring each team member can deliver on their committed timelines without compromising quality.

The combination of Prateek\'s Salesforce package readiness, Sanyog\'s infrastructure foundation, and Erica\'s platform integration capabilities positions the team to deliver significant customer value in Q3, provided we can implement the agent-based privacy solution and resolve the multi-timezone coordination challenges that continue to create execution friction.

# **Admin Team Executive Roundup - 7/28/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

This week, a significant pivot was made by Jessie Lindstrom\'s team to assist with the AI Credit consumption work, which is critical for launching Copilot v.2 and GTM Studio. The team is making progress on getting tickets ready for the AI credit work, but key decisions still need to be made regarding the AI Action Price book and revenue reporting. An open quest remains on how we intend to package and enable customers on Copilot v.2, which needs to be resolved before the feature can be released to customers.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

- Jessie Lindstrom\'s team has shifted focus to support Brannen Huske\'s AI credit consumption work. This is a strategic pivot as the original goal to scope requirements for user entitlements on the agentic platform is no longer needed for the August 5th deadline, but is still required for Beta.

- The login team, led by Josh Simon, successfully launched a new banner for the \"login as\" feature, which is a win for compliance. This banner, which appears as a red warning, notifies users when they are impersonating a customer, which helps prevent mistakes. Additionally, email was shut off as a two-factor authentication (2FA) method for new users, which is another significant security improvement.

- Progress has been made on the AI credit architecture and revenue reporting. Brannen\'s team has clarified the process for creating SKUs, loading AI credits into wallets, and managing charges and holds. A kickoff meeting has also taken place with the Revenue Recognition and Go-to-Market Studio teams to discuss how to report revenue to SAP as it is used.

### **Goals & Progress**

- **AI Credit Architecture and Revenue Reporting**: The goal is to complete the AI Credit architecture and determine how to report usage-based revenue to SAP. Brannen Huske\'s team is 70% done with this goal, as they have conducted two rounds of technical requirement reviews and have defined how to manage credits and holds. There are still some open items, such as deciding where the AI Action Price book will live and working with the CFA team on reporting AI usage to customers.

- **Login & Privacy Initiatives**: Josh Simon finalized second-half goals for the login and privacy teams, and has gotten sign-off from engineering. The team is starting work on login milestones and has completed a prototype for Data Password Control v.3, which uses a manager hierarchy for assigning roles. Josh is meeting with the design team next week to kick off the design work.

- **User Entitlements for Agentic Platform**: Jessie Lindstrom\'s original goal was to scope and estimate the requirements for agents to respect user entitlements. Development was the completion criteria. Due to a shift in priorities, this work is being pushed back, but Jessie plans to dedicate time next week to scope out the requirements.

### **Strategic Challenges**

- A major challenge is the lack of a defined solution for the agentic platform to respect user entitlements. This is a critical security concern, as copilot v.2 and the new platform cannot be released to customers if agents can perform actions a user is not entitled to. The team needs help from the agent platform team to determine the necessary work.

- The packaging and selling strategy for Copilot v.2 remains a blind spot. It\'s unclear if it will be a free upgrade or have new entitlements. A meeting is scheduled with Sean and Carlos to review the New Product Introduction (NPI) document and make a decision, which will inform the next steps for development. The outcome of this meeting will impact revenue targets and requires a decision from the packaging team.

- The team is still investigating a persistent issue where some Snowflake users are being logged out or \"bounced out\" of the platform daily or weekly. The team has met with three users this week and has more meetings scheduled to understand the problem. This unknown issue is a key focus for the team.

### **Strategic Insights**

- The login team has identified an ongoing problem with marketing and talent teams not respecting privacy controls. A customer issue arose where Do Not Call (DNC) was not being respected in the talent feature. Dan Skellen, the product manager for talent, already has a ticket for this issue. This highlights the need for dedicated time to be put aside to go through features on a case-by-case basis to ensure privacy controls are being respected across all teams.

- It was discovered that a decision needs to be made on where the AI Action Price book will reside. The agentic group originally discussed it being on their side, but they are now making the case that it could also live on the AI credit team\'s side. This is an important decision to be made to finalize the architecture and move forward with the work.

- A key learning for Jessie Lindstrom was the need for flexibility and the ability to pivot, especially during times of stress. The original goal of scoping user entitlements was deprioritized because it wasn\'t needed for a fast-approaching deadline, allowing the team to shift focus to the AI credit work.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

- Our work with the **Revenue Reporting Team**, owned by Garrett, is critical for completing the AI Credit architecture. We need to work with his team to determine how to report revenue as usage-based, which will influence the final architecture. A kickoff call with relevant business units has already occurred.

- Coordination with the **Agent Platform Team** is essential for determining the solution for agents to respect user entitlements. The level of effort and the solution for this are currently unknown, which is a major blind spot.

### **Looking Ahead**

The primary focus for next week will be to make key decisions to unblock the AI credit consumption work and the Copilot v.2 and GTM Studio launch.

Our top priorities include:

- **Finalizing AI Credit Architecture Decisions:** We have a meetings next week with contracts team, Rev Req team ,and Agentic team to finalize decision on Usaged Base Pricing. These decisions will allow us to complete the AI Credit architecture and get the tickets to 100% shovel-ready.

- **Defining Copilot v.2 Enablement:** Brannen will meet with Sean and Carlos on Monday to review the NPI document to get a decision on the packaging and entitlements for Copilot v.2. This is a critical step, as it will determine the necessary development work.

- **Addressing AI Usage Reporting:** Jessie will be taking on the conversation with the CFA team on Monday to discuss how to report AI usage to customers. This is one of the final pieces of the AI credit work that needs to be addressed before a general availability (GA) launch.

These meetings and conversations are crucial for maintaining momentum and getting the necessary alignment to move forward with both the AI credit work and the GTM Studio launch. We are confident that by tackling these open items, the team will be able to deliver on its commitments.

# **Analytics Team Executive Roundup - August 1, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**Copilot adoption emerged as our highest-impact opportunity this week, with only 34% of provisioned users becoming active - representing a potential 9,500 additional users with just a 10 percentage point improvement.** Phoebe Mei completed a comprehensive analytics roadmap identifying adoption and retention as top priorities, while technical challenges with dashboard infrastructure have temporarily delayed some deliverables. The team is realigning resources to focus on the most impactful user behavior insights that can drive immediate product improvements.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Phoebe Mei delivered a complete copilot analytics roadmap that identified our biggest leverage point: the 66% drop-off between user provisioning and activation represents nearly 10,000 potential additional users. Her analysis revealed that improving adoption by just 10 percentage points could unlock significant user growth while expanding the cohort size for downstream retention and usage optimization.

Farrell Tanuvdjaja made substantial progress on target account exploration, conducting initial enterprise and mid-market segmentation analysis. His preliminary findings suggest enterprise accounts may have fewer target accounts than mid-market segments, though this requires further validation through utilization and persona analysis next week.

Inbal Kor completed an in-depth analysis of workbook feature usage, discovering that 99% of active users engage with enrichment functionality, averaging 58 actions each. Her research revealed strong user behavior patterns around workbook reuse, with 70% of users returning to existing workbooks rather than creating new ones, indicating successful workflow integration.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Copilot Analytics Foundation**: Phoebe Mei achieved 100% completion on establishing the analytics roadmap framework. She successfully identified adoption as the primary focus area and will meet with product leadership next week to align on analytical priorities and business questions for each funnel stage.

**Target Account Analysis**: Farrell Tanuvdjaja reached 80% completion on his cohort analysis despite knowledge transfer challenges as his first exposure to the feature. Next week, Phoebe Mei will lead the deeper dive into SMB segments, utilization patterns, and persona analysis to validate initial enterprise versus mid-market findings.

**Dashboard Infrastructure**: Nanxi Ge encountered significant technical setbacks requiring a complete data source rebuild due to granularity issues causing system crashes. While only 40% complete, she identified a more efficient approach of testing with smaller datasets before scaling, which will inform future development methodology.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Dashboard performance issues created unexpected delays when the original infrastructure couldn\'t handle the full dataset size, forcing Nanxi Ge to rebuild from scratch during a week when she was also managing illness. The granularity problems revealed the need for a more systematic approach to data architecture, testing incrementally rather than attempting full-scale implementation immediately.

Resource availability constraints will impact next week\'s momentum as Nanxi Ge will be unavailable, requiring the team to postpone certain releases and adjust project timelines. The team has planned office hours for when she returns to ensure continuity and knowledge transfer.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The copilot adoption analysis revealed that low utilization creates a cascading effect that limits all downstream insights and optimization opportunities. With only 34% of provisioned users becoming active, the current user base is too small to generate meaningful patterns for retention and feature usage analysis, making adoption improvement the clear strategic priority.

User behavior analysis uncovered highly concentrated usage patterns, with the top 3% of users creating 42% of all sheets and being 2-3x more likely to use AI and advanced features. This power user concentration, combined with clear departmental usage patterns (Sales and Ops for broad data mixing, CS and Ops for company-level insights), suggests targeted optimization opportunities for different user segments.

Enterprise account analysis challenged initial assumptions about target account distribution, with preliminary data suggesting enterprise segments may have fewer target accounts than mid-market. This finding requires validation but could significantly impact go-to-market strategy and resource allocation decisions.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the onboarding team on connecting onboarding scores to setup factor analysis is progressing well, with Phoebe Mei set to analyze correlations between during-onboarding performance, post-onboarding scores, and account segment outcomes. The onboarding team has provided both numerical scores (out of 100) and letter grades (A-D) for comprehensive analysis.

Collaboration with product leadership becomes critical next week as Phoebe Mei presents analytical recommendations and business questions for each funnel stage. This alignment will determine resource allocation and ensure analytics priorities support product strategy effectively.

### **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on converting insights into actionable product improvements, with particular emphasis on the copilot adoption opportunity that could unlock nearly 10,000 additional users.

Phoebe Mei will lead strategic discussions with product leadership while simultaneously conducting deep-dive analysis connecting onboarding performance to setup factor success indicators. Her work on correlating existing onboarding scores, post-onboarding performance, and renewal outcomes will provide crucial data for improving the user journey. Meanwhile, she\'ll continue leading the target account exploration with deeper SMB analysis and persona validation.

The team maintains strong momentum despite technical setbacks, with clear priorities established around the highest-impact opportunities. Once dashboard infrastructure challenges are resolved, the combination of user behavior insights and adoption optimization strategies positions us to drive significant product improvements and user growth.

# **Semantic Data Team Executive Roundup - July 28th - Aug 1st 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The Semantic Data team is converging on critical demo preparation for August 11th while achieving major technical milestones. Jon Seller is 80% complete on authentication and multi-tenant pipeline capabilities---a foundational requirement for enterprise scalability. The team discovered during Friday\'s meeting that authentication scope can be limited to ETL processes only, removing a major deployment blocker. With Rowan Bailey successfully building essential data connectors and Danny Pan initiating Paychex data ingestion, the team is positioned to deliver compelling semantic search demonstrations to executive leadership.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Jon Seller made significant progress on authentication implementation, discovering mid-meeting that the scope could be reduced to pipeline endpoints only, eliminating concerns about breaking existing integrations. This breakthrough means multi-tenant processing can be enabled as early as today, unblocking enterprise customer onboarding.

Rowan Bailey transitioned from strategic planning to hands-on development, successfully building and deploying critical data connectors to the data resolution service. These connectors are now live in staging, though some are consuming over 200k tokens per account brief---an issue that needs optimization but demonstrates the richness of available data.

Inga Isakov advanced the email entity distribution analysis while identifying potential cost savings in job listings processing. Her discovery that some job posting data may already exist in existing tables could significantly reduce LLM processing costs, demonstrating the value of systematic data investigation.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Authentication & Multi-Tenant Pipeline**: Jon achieved 80% completion on enabling secure multi-tenant data processing. The authentication framework from the agentic platform has been successfully adapted, with deployment path clarified during team discussion. Final implementation expected within days.

**Data Ingestion & Quality**: Danny Pan secured budget approval and initiated Paychex data ingestion, with 100 conversations already processed in production. The team needs to determine optimal historical data depth for different customer segments, balancing completeness with processing costs.

**Demo Infrastructure**: Rowan\'s connector development directly addresses urgent needs from the agentic team, with several endpoints now operational. The proposed demo flow---identifying accounts that have discussed Clay and surfacing their feedback---will showcase semantic search capabilities with citation links back to source Chorus transcripts.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Authentication deployment timing remains delicate despite the reduced scope. Jon Seller needs to coordinate the rollout carefully to avoid disrupting existing services, though the discovery that only ETL endpoints need securing significantly reduces risk. The team will implement this change before the demo while ensuring zero downtime.

Data quality visibility continues to challenge the team\'s confidence. Rowan Bailey highlighted that staging data is \"incredibly sparse,\" making it difficult to assess what context exists for any given account. Without comprehensive visibility into token-by-token quality, the team risks demo surprises. This drives next week\'s priority to audit data completeness for demo accounts.

Access to enhanced tenant data for the demo requires resolution. Danny Pan identified the need for a clear path to accessing zoom info tenant data that\'s been processed, requiring alignment with Ryan on the technical approach. This blocker could impact demo readiness if not resolved early next week.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Automated testing is revealing critical quality issues that manual reviews miss. Jon Seller\'s expanded test suite discovered attribution bugs that would have impacted demo accuracy. This validates the investment in comprehensive testing infrastructure and suggests expanding automated quality checks across all data types.

The tool planner\'s inconsistent selection behavior represents a fundamental challenge in the agentic architecture. Rowan\'s observation that tool selection \"feels like a dice roll\" indicates the need for either better guardrails or parallel tool execution capabilities. This insight could reshape how the platform handles ambiguous queries.

Deployment pipeline differences between production and development environments created unexpected complexity. Jon\'s deep dive with Danny revealed nuances that explain past deployment failures. Documenting these differences will prevent future issues and accelerate deployment velocity.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our collaboration with the agentic team on data connector development is critical for demo success. Lars\'s request for help building connectors revealed that existing implementations were exploding context windows with 200k+ token payloads. Rowan\'s direct involvement ensures connectors are optimized for production use.

Integration with Josh on the co-pilot pro table-based UI requires tight coordination next week. The citation functionality Danny outlined---parsing fragment IDs and start times---appears straightforward but needs careful testing with real customer data to ensure reliability during executive demonstrations.

### **Looking Ahead**

Demo preparation dominates next week\'s agenda with the August 11th executive leadership presentation approaching. The team will focus on three critical paths: enabling authentication for multi-tenant processing, validating data quality for 20-30 demo accounts, and optimizing latency for the Clay competitor analysis use case.

Rowan will lead data quality assessment, creating comprehensive visibility into what context exists across demo accounts. This includes token counts, data completeness metrics, and quality spot-checks on earnings calls, 10-Ks, and customer engagement transcripts. With only a 3-day week and reduced team overlap due to Monday\'s holiday, coordination efficiency is paramount.

The citation implementation represents a key differentiator for the demo, allowing executives to verify AI-generated insights against source materials. While technically straightforward---requiring only fragment origin IDs and timestamps---the user experience must be flawless. Thursday\'s practice run will be crucial for identifying any remaining issues before the executive presentation.
