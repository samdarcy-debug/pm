### **Individual Team Reports**

# **DAI Executive Roundup - August 11th - August 15th, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The Gartner Magic Quadrant demo on Tuesday positions ZoomInfo for a potential upper-right placement in the consolidated Revenue Action Orchestration category, fundamentally shifting our market perception from data provider to GTM platform. Victor Oliveros and Sneh Kakileti have unified our entire product surface area into a compelling narrative that leverages workbooks, Account AI, and Chorus momentum view to score 75/100 on forecasting despite lacking a true forecasting tool. The SalesLoft-Clary merger creates a 2-3 year integration nightmare for competitors, clearing our path to market leadership. However, internal confusion around Copilot V2 rollout timing has activated hundreds of people without proper coordination, requiring immediate narrative control.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Adam Smith\'s team rebuilt the foundational Copilot orchestration agents over the weekend, delivering a demo-ready experience that confidently showcases end-to-end workflows from UI to chat output. The engineering team worked 18 consecutive days to overcome Friday\'s critical failures, resulting in consistent, high-quality agent performance that eliminates the dice-rolling uncertainty that previously plagued demos. Henry and James Roth\'s positive reception validates both the renewal potential and sales viability of our agentic platform.

Brandon Tucker finalized the target account list for vertical datasets, unlocking a clear path to \$10M+ incremental H2 revenue through 300+ qualified accounts across restaurant, franchise, and contractor segments. The team resolved critical franchise data matching blockers and secured an S&P Global Mobility partnership for best-in-market fleet data, transforming a zero-revenue assumption into a significant upside opportunity. Dow is already engaging account managers on the highest-potential accounts with comprehensive tracking of every touchpoint.

Ali Sadat established architectural clarity on the GraphQL Query API, and Datasets delivery. For Dataset delivery -, with Majid leading end-to-end architecture and weekly engineering reviews driving toward October phase 1 completion. The GraphQL metadata-driven approach provides a scalable foundation that preserves existing federated search investments while enabling future expansion. Clear requirements alignment with Adam Smith\'s team on Copilot V2 data retrieval creates a solid technical path forward.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Gartner Magic Quadrant Positioning**: Victor Oliveros achieved 75% completion on the Revenue Action Orchestration demo, successfully unifying ZoomInfo\'s entire product ecosystem into a coherent go-to-market platform narrative. The AI-assisted questionnaire drafting accelerated preparation, and the consolidated quadrant format plays to our strengths in prospecting while competitors struggle with integration challenges. Sneh Kakileti\'s partnership on demo script development ensures technical depth matches marketing messaging.

**Copilot V2 Development Momentum**: Adam Smith\'s team achieved breakthrough consistency in agent performance after weekend infrastructure rebuild, moving from unreliable dice-rolling to production-ready demonstrations. The pricing model with Mark Harris progressed significantly, establishing flexible AI credit architecture that scales across Studio and Copilot without foundational restarts. However, sales readiness requires additional rough-edge polishing beyond demo-specific implementations.

**Vertical Datasets Revenue Engine**: Brandon Tucker delivered 90% completion on target account qualification, with V1 lists finalized and franchise data matching blockers resolved. The self-serve cube evaluation capability removes manual bottlenecks that previously slowed customer engagement. S&P Global Mobility partnership expands addressable market beyond initial projections, while systematic AM touchpoint tracking ensures no qualified opportunity falls through execution gaps.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Internal narrative control has become critical as Copilot V2 excitement generated hundreds of activated stakeholders without coordination, creating chaos that threatens execution focus. Random employees are scheduling training sessions on non-existent products, and one-on-one Slack responses from PMM team members scale poorly, generating telephone-game misinformation. The organization\'s nervousness around short timeframes justifies the anxiety, but requires top-down narrative ownership rather than reactive individual responses to restore order.

Query API confusion persists across teams, with conflicting timelines from \"end of year\" to \"available in August\" creating engineering uncertainty and blocking dependent work streams. The federated search versus GraphQL API distinction needs clarity for consuming teams to make informed decisions. While Ali Sadat\'s narrowed scope on datasets provides focus, broader GTM data model requirements remain unresolved, potentially impacting workbook team integration post-September.

GTM Studio\'s current chat implementation directly interacts with workbook pipelines, limiting agentic capabilities to existing data source connections rather than enabling general-purpose research and list building. Sneh Kakileti identified this as a fundamental pattern that must be generalized for true agentic value - today\'s implementation cannot support workflows like \"research Dreamforce sponsors and find VPs of event marketing,\" which represents the core value proposition for Q4 sales planning use cases.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The Gartner Magic Quadrant consolidation creates an unexpected opportunity for market leadership, as ZoomInfo checks more boxes than initially anticipated across the expanded category scope. Victor Oliveros discovered our workbooks, Account AI, and Chorus integration provide credible forecasting capabilities that score significantly higher than expected. The SalesLoft-Clary merger represents a survival deal rather than offensive strategy, with Vista\'s cost-cutting mandate forcing immediate engineering relocation to India and creating 2-3 year integration paralysis for key competitors.

Q4 sales planning and territory building emerges as the optimal positioning for GTM Studio, aligning product capabilities with seasonal timing and ops-focused personas. Sneh Kakileti\'s analysis of successful customer demos reveals that account-specific attribute preparation and use case-driven flows generate the strongest engagement. This seasonal focus provides clear messaging differentiation from Copilot V2\'s seller-focused capabilities while leveraging Studio\'s current technical strengths.

Website buyer ID represents our most compelling signal for immediate monetization, yet lacks sufficient product surface area for customers to experience its value. Dominik Facher identified this as easily a few million dollars in new business opportunity, requiring signal-based workbooks, API access, and MCP integration to create end-to-end customer value. The identity graph improvements and real-time resolution capabilities provide competitive differentiation that remains largely invisible in current product interfaces.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with engineering teams on agentic platform stability continues to be critical for both Copilot V2 and GTM Studio success. Adam Smith\'s weekend rebuild demonstrates the engineering team\'s commitment, but maintaining momentum requires continued focus on customer-ready polish beyond demo-specific implementations. The credit system architecture under Brandon Tucker and Ali Sadat\'s teams needs completion to enable proper consumption tracking across all AI-powered features.

Partnership execution with S&P Global Mobility and vertical dataset partners requires legal and procurement process optimization to avoid the current 6+ week contract cycles that overwhelm smaller partners. Brandon Tucker identified this as a bottleneck for the broader flywheel partner strategy, where procurement complexity burns relationships before signature completion.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s primary focus centers on controlling the Copilot V2 narrative through executive-driven communication while maintaining engineering momentum toward customer readiness. Victor Oliveros, Adam Smith, Sneh Kakileti, and Dominik Facher will create a rollout schedule asset that provides clarity on access timing, asset delivery, and training availability to address organizational anxiety and eliminate counterproductive individual responses.

The Gartner Magic Quadrant demo on Tuesday represents a pivotal moment for market repositioning, requiring final alignment between product capabilities and messaging strategy. Success here fundamentally shifts ZoomInfo\'s perception from data provider to GTM platform leader, providing significant pipeline generation and competitive differentiation. Post-demo execution must immediately capitalize on this positioning through coordinated sales enablement and customer messaging.

GTM Studio\'s September soft launch preparation demands resolution of the agentic platform limitations and signal-based workbook delivery to unlock Q4 sales planning use cases. Sneh Kakileti\'s demo script completion and workbook library development create the foundation for seasonal positioning, while technical dependencies on query APIs and general-purpose research capabilities determine feature completeness. The intersection of these initiatives with Copilot V2 rollout requires careful coordination to avoid market confusion and maximize combined impact.

# **Data Executive Roundup - August 11th - August 14th, 2025**

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Vertical Dataset Market Validation Exceeded Expectations**: Dow Jones completed account mapping across all priority datasets, identifying restaurant (qualified accounts), contractor (OSHA violation interest confirmed), and franchise opportunities with high-confidence revenue potential in H2. Brandon Tucker\'s conversation with Mastercard confirmed strong interest in franchise cube and restaurant data, demonstrating that market demand exists at the enterprise level without additional education required.

**Chorus Email Signature Breakthrough Identified**: Rob Priore discovered ZoomInfo captures 2 million full email signatures monthly from Chorus but currently uses only IP2ORG data. Legal approval obtained for expanding usage to email deliverability capabilities, with potential for company matching tile integration. This represents a significant incremental data enhancement opportunity requiring minimal technical investment.

**Lost Deal Signal Architecture Completed**: Steve Hutchinson finalized definitions for Lost Deals and Dormant Accounts, enabling priority accounts pipeline integration. The foundation now exists to surface funding rounds, C-suite changes, and other re-engagement signals for accounts that previously fell off radar. David Golden\'s involvement ensures cross-functional alignment on implementation approach.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Multi-Agent Coordination Breakthrough**: Ethan Young successfully tested coordination between multiple AI agents for data catalog creation and query generation, achieving streamlined analysis workflows that reduce manual data discovery overhead. The confluence space documentation shows promising early results, though Snowflake and BigQuery access limitations through ZI Chat create implementation dependencies.

**Latin America Company Expansion Progressing**: Dana Hurtig continued ramping company DIP processes with 226,000 companies completed and additional 180,000 queued. URL validation uncovered quality issues (43% inactive URLs), requiring deeper analysis to distinguish between genuinely invalid companies versus viable businesses without functional websites, particularly in Brazilian market segments.

**Org Chart Agent Development**: Jody Roberts made progress toward working prototype deadline, though GAL data connectivity to agentic platform remains a technical blocker requiring engineering support. The roadmap artifact preparation for Tuesday sharing with desk team is on track for Monday completion.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Resource Allocation Creating Execution Bottlenecks**: Multiple team members are operating at 50-70% goal completion rates due to competing priorities rather than technical limitations. Brandon Wilson\'s signal generation work, Dana Hurtig\'s data quality improvements, and Jody Roberts\' agentic platform exploration are all valuable initiatives that require dedicated focus to achieve excellence rather than acceptable outcomes.

**Data Platform Integration Dependencies**: Ethan Young identified significant limitations with ZI Chat\'s current architecture for data team workflows, specifically the lack of direct Snowflake and BigQuery access. The semantic layer abstraction approach conflicts with the team\'s need for direct query capabilities, potentially requiring pushback against standard data access restrictions to unlock agentic solutions.

**Cross-Functional Coordination Gaps**: The team\'s work on contributory network data ingestion, website key buyer ID requirements, and partnership integration processes reveals systematic challenges in aligning legal, security, and engineering stakeholders around data initiatives. These coordination gaps consume disproportionate time relative to technical complexity of the work itself.

## **Strategic** **Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Vertical Dataset Demand Validation Changes Go-to-Market Strategy**: Customer conversations consistently demonstrate that vertical datasets address existing pain points rather than requiring market education. The shift from \"here\'s a new capability\" to \"here\'s the data you\'ve been asking for\" fundamentally changes sales approach, timeline expectations, and pricing discussions. This validation supports aggressive H2 revenue targets.

**AI Agent Orchestration Shows Production Readiness**: Ethan Young\'s multi-agent coordination testing demonstrates that current AI capabilities can handle complex data analysis workflows beyond simple query generation. The data catalog agent combined with analysis agent approach could significantly reduce time-to-insight for routine data investigations, though infrastructure access remains a limiting factor.

**Email Signature Data Represents Massive Untapped Asset**: Rob Priore\'s discovery that ZoomInfo already captures 2 million monthly email signatures from Chorus without full utilization reveals systematic gaps in data asset leverage. Legal approval for expanded usage suggests similar opportunities may exist across other integrated tools and platforms.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the GTM team on vertical dataset prioritization continues to be critical for H2 revenue execution. Brandon Tucker and Dow Jones have established clear communication channels with R&G leadership, though the validation process requires ongoing account manager engagement to convert interest into active opportunities.

The Snowflake access limitation for agentic platform development creates dependencies on data platform team decisions that could impact multiple AI agent initiatives. Ethan Young\'s needs for direct query access may require executive support to override standard data access protocols.

## **Looking Ahead**

**September Focus Must Prioritize Revenue-Generating Activities**: The team has validated multiple high-value opportunities but needs disciplined focus on execution over exploration. Vertical dataset samples and evaluation support should take precedence over new data source integrations or experimental AI workflows until H2 revenue commitments are secured.

**Agentic Platform Development Requires Infrastructure Decisions**: The promising results from multi-agent coordination testing demand resolution of data access limitations and platform connectivity issues. Executive decision-making needed on whether to invest in workaround solutions or push for systematic platform improvements that benefit multiple teams.

**Cross-Functional Alignment Becomes Execution Enabler**: The team\'s technical capabilities consistently exceed organizational coordination speed. Establishing clearer decision-making processes for legal approvals, security reviews, and engineering prioritization would unlock significantly more value from existing team capacity than additional headcount or technical tools.

# **SalesOS/Copilot Executive Roundup - August 11th - August 14th, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Copilot V2 beta launch on track for September with strong momentum on AI emailer and engagement insights prototypes. Harinath successfully completed comprehensive enablement documentation for Intent Topic AI Recommendations, while Adam\'s Launch Copilot experience is prod-ready with internal testing starting next week. Critical dependency blocker identified: federated search for Priority Accounts may slip to Q1 2026, requiring immediate architectural decisions from search leadership.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**AI-Powered Email Agent Achievement**: Gabe delivered a working Copilot Chat email prototype using the agentic platform, demonstrating successful integration of multiple data sources and tools. The prototype shows promise for inclusion in the September Copilot V2 beta, with clear next steps established for prompt refinement and user feedback collection.

**Intent Recommendation Launch Readiness**: Harinath created a comprehensive 16-section support and enablement document for the Intent Topic AI Recommendation feature, covering customer objections, support workflows, and success metrics. This proactive documentation approach should reduce post-launch support escalations by 40-50% while accelerating feature adoption across enterprise customers.

**Copilot Launch Infrastructure Complete**: Adam\'s team successfully deployed all Launch Copilot tickets to production, with the admin-facing setup experience ready for internal testing. The user threshold requirements (3 target accounts, 3 signals) are in place to ensure quality user experiences from day one, with Cisco identified as the pilot customer for the September phased release.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Intent & Account Intelligence**: Harinath progressed Intent side overlay redesign to 75% completion, with design team feedback incorporated and engineering handoff scheduled for next week. The LRT process for September releases is 50% complete, covering Account Fit Score date/time filters, smart retry mechanisms, and HubSpot CRM support for prioritize packages. These features address the top customer requests from enterprise and mid-market segments.

**Advanced Search Modernization**: Al completed 6 strategic user interviews revealing critical insights about CRM integration needs, with users stating \"if you had websites inside Advanced Search, I would use it every day.\" Sarah was successfully onboarded as the new design partner, and the UXR findings validate the hybrid natural language + faceted search approach for the next generation platform.

**Territory Management Beta Expansion**: David onboarded 5 additional customers to the Admin Defined Territories beta this week, bringing the total closer to the 20-customer goal. User-defined territories showed 50% better conversion rates after 6 months, validating the admin-driven approach for scalable territory management across large organizations.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Federated Search Dependency Risk**: Priority Accounts CRM matching capabilities are blocked by federated search architecture that may not deliver until Q1 2026. This impacts our ability to support custom CRM fields and account team objects that enterprise customers require. David needs search leadership alignment on either accelerating federated search delivery or implementing interim solutions to avoid losing competitive advantage in lead routing.

**Resource Constraints Affecting Quality**: Recent QA team reductions are creating testing bottlenecks across all releases, with engineers now responsible for end-to-end testing of their own code. Harinath flagged this as a significant risk for upcoming features, particularly the September Intent launches. The team needs dedicated QA support or formal testing protocols to maintain release quality standards.

**V2 Integration Planning Gap**: Multiple team members highlighted the need for clearer V2 roadmap coordination with Sean\'s team. Current focus on agentic technology development is moving fast, but there\'s insufficient attention to data requirements that power first-time user experiences. Victor identified this as a critical blind spot that could impact V2 adoption rates.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**CRM Integration is the User Experience Multiplier**: Advanced Search UXR revealed that CRM integration quality directly drives daily usage - users will abandon even the best signal discovery tools if they can\'t easily filter by territory, customer status, or account team assignments. This validates our enterprise-first approach and reinforces the importance of solving the federated search challenge immediately.

**Internal Testing Accelerates External Success**: Harinath\'s approach to enabling internal teams as beta users for Intent Recommendations creates a feedback loop that reduces external customer risk while providing experienced user insights. This model should be applied to other feature launches to improve success rates and customer satisfaction.

**Prototype-Driven Alignment Creates Development Velocity**: Ant\'s team rebuilt company profiles and signals modules in days rather than weeks when working with focused prototypes in person. The Bethesda session demonstrated that bringing distributed teams together around working prototypes generates exponentially faster decision-making and execution.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with search architecture teams on federated search continues to be critical for enterprise Priority Accounts delivery. Current uncertainty around Q1 2026 delivery timeline creates cascading risks for CRM matching, territory management, and competitive positioning against LeanData. David is coordinating with Harsha and Imesh to determine if interim GraphQL solutions can bridge the gap while federated search development continues.

The V2 integration planning requires closer collaboration with Sean\'s development team as we approach the September beta. Victor is establishing weekly roadmap sessions to ensure our feature delivery aligns with the overall V2 architecture while maintaining focus on proven aha moments rather than expanding scope prematurely.

## **Looking Ahead**

September Beta Launch Preparation Intensifies with internal enablement starting next week for Launch Copilot, followed by Gartner Magic Quadrant demo preparation featuring our integrated platform story across Copilot, Chorus, and ROI dashboard capabilities.

The team will focus on three critical deliverables: finalizing the AI emailer prototype quality to exceed human-written standards for Dominik review, completing Intent Topic AI Recommendation enablement across all internal teams, and resolving the federated search architectural decision to unblock enterprise CRM matching. Success metrics include achieving internal user adoption thresholds, positive Gartner analyst feedback on our platform convergence story, and maintaining September beta timeline despite dependency challenges.

Priority coordination meetings are scheduled with search leadership, enablement teams, and design partners to address the federated search blocker, complete V2 feature integration planning, and ensure quality standards are maintained despite QA resource constraints. The team demonstrates strong execution momentum and cross-functional collaboration, positioning us well to deliver transformational user experiences in the September release.

# **Admin Team Executive Roundup - August 11, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

This week, the team secured a significant win with the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and made key progress on AI credit mechanics and user entitlements. We\'ve successfully onboarded LSEG to the data privacy controls (DAC) and hope this will lead to a contract win over LinkedIn Sales Navigator. On the AI side, the team has gained consensus on the mechanics of non-usage-based AI credits and usage-based customer bulk AI action credits. We also advanced the user entitlement tickets for the Agentic platform, with Jessie Lindstrom handing off the requirements document to Lars for review.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

The London Stock Exchange Group was successfully onboarded to the data privacy controls. Josh Simon believes this could lead to a contract win over LinkedIn Sales Navigator and serve as a key logo for privacy, as it would prove that the company\'s privacy controls are adequate for one of the most regulated customers.

Brannen Huske focused on finalizing the requirements for AI action credits, specifically locking down the mechanics for drawing down credits. The team reached a consensus on the difference between recurring non-usage-based and non-recurring usage-based credits, which will affect revenue reporting.

Jessie Lindstrom\'s high-leverage goal was to get user entitlement tickets for the Agentic platform reviewed with engineering. She wrote a requirements document and handed it off to Lars for review, marking the task as 75% complete.

### **Goals & Progress**

**AI Credits**: Brannen Huske\'s goal this week was to lock down the requirements for AI credits. The team achieved consensus on recurring versus non-recurring credits and how they will impact revenue reporting. The value of recurring, non-usage-based AI credits will be summed up with the ACV in the initial contract, while usage-based bulk AI action credits will be sent to the RevRec team for recognition with SAP at a regular interval.

**Data Privacy & Login**: Josh Simon aimed to onboard LSEG and Microsoft to data privacy controls. LSEG was successfully onboarded and demonstrated great interest, but Microsoft had layoffs, which delayed their implementation. Additionally, Josh is investigating why users from Palo Alto Networks and Snowflake are being logged out of their sessions overnight. The leading theory is that session cookies should be stored as HTTP only.

**Agentic Platform User Entitlements**: Jessie Lindstrom\'s goal was to get user entitlement tickets for the Agentic platform reviewed by engineering. She wrote a requirements document and shared a one-pager with Lars, who is now reviewing the tickets. Jessie will work with him to ensure the tickets are reviewed and to determine who on the team needs to consult with the Agentic team.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Microsoft\'s recent layoffs have caused a delay in implementing the data passport control, despite the team proving they could support the use case. This situation will be monitored, and the team will continue working with their internal account team.

A persistent challenge involves users being bounced out of their sessions overnight. The team is investigating this issue with users from Palo Alto Networks and Snowflake. The current leading theory is that session cookies should be better stored as HTTP only, but converting them would be a significant amount of work for all downstream teams.

The implementation of the AI Price Book is a complex issue. Jessie Kain Lindstrom noted that no one has figured out how to price for platforms dependent on external large language models (LMs) and external costs. There are \"a million different ways\" to implement this, and the team needs to align on a path forward.

### **Strategic Insights**

**AI Pricing**: The AI Price Book is an interesting and challenging space because there is no established method for pricing platforms that rely on external large language models and associated costs. Jessie Kain Lindstrom has put together a requirements document for review by engineering to set the stage for future discussions. The team will need to align on an implementation plan and identify the team to build it.

**Data Privacy**: The successful onboarding of LSEG validates the team\'s privacy controls and positions ZoomInfo as a market leader in privacy. This success provides a strong narrative for winning over other highly regulated customers.

**Session Cookies**: After meeting with users from Palo Alto Networks and Snowflake, the team\'s leading theory is that converting session cookies to HTTP only could solve the issue of users being logged out overnight. This potential solution is considered the closest they\'ve come to finalizing a solution.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Work with the engineering team is critical for getting the user entitlement tickets for the Agentic platform reviewed and fleshed out. Jessie Lindstrom will be working with Lars to ensure the tickets are reviewed and to figure out which team members need to consult with the Agentic team.

The RevRec team will be responsible for recognizing revenue from the usage-based bulk AI action credits, which will be sent to them at a regular interval via Boomi. This is a new process that is essential for driving usage-based revenue.

### **Looking Ahead**

Next week, the team will continue to focus on a number of key initiatives. Josh Simon plans to pivot back to his \"logging in as\" workstream. He intends to send out a survey to product and engineering to understand their reasons for logging in as other users, and then set up a product review.

Jessie Lindstrom\'s next steps for the Agentic platform involve working with Lars to ensure the user entitlement tickets are reviewed and identifying which team members need to help with the consultation. For the AI Price Book, the team will have another meeting to align on an implementation plan and figure out who will build it.

Brannen Huske\'s goal for next week is to pivot to verticalized data sets. He has a few meetings scheduled to determine how to package, price, and load this data into GTM Studio.

# **Business Intelligence Team Executive Roundup - August 15, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Whitney\'s continued resistance to ELT feedback on continuous scoring is forcing a strategic pivot away from current account health measurement efforts. AJ and Victor are developing alternative basic risk reporting to bridge the gap until Copilot Pro launches in November, when the team will refocus measurement efforts on this new customer segment. Meanwhile, the team is making solid progress on Copilot Pro launch preparation and advancing critical experimentation frameworks despite resource constraints.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Phoebe completed comprehensive data requirements and SQL code development for semantic layer setup factors, positioning the team to support AI-powered business intelligence queries once engineering capacity becomes available. Her collaboration with the engineering team provided clear visibility into implementation steps, though capacity constraints require escalation through Nir and Russell for prioritization.

The team conducted successful Copilot Pro mockup sessions with Megan that revealed critical insights about user behavior patterns and conversion metrics. These sessions helped refine business questions around the three key \"aha moments\" and identified potential challenges with email copy conversion rates that may require product iteration to maintain user engagement.

Nanxi established strong partnerships with Integration and Advertising teams, successfully aligning on KPI frameworks and launching hypothesis testing initiatives. The Integration team immediately engaged her support for A-B testing banner optimization, while both teams expressed high interest in structured experimentation approaches to drive product decisions.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Account Health Measurement**: Current approach facing significant headwinds due to Whitney\'s resistance to continuous scoring methodology despite direct ELT feedback supporting this direction. AJ completed ChatGPT research validating the team\'s proposed approach as industry best practice, but stakeholder alignment remains elusive. Team pivoting to basic risk reporting framework with Victor to maintain forward momentum while reassessing strategy.

**Copilot Pro Launch Readiness**: Strong progress on data requirements and business question development, with Phoebe and Imbal preparing comprehensive reporting framework for November GA launch. Team identified key metrics around user engagement patterns and conversion optimization, though some concerns exist around email personalization and copy behavior changes that may impact traditional conversion tracking.

**Experimentation Framework Development**: Nanxi advanced conversations with Integration and Advertising teams on three strategic areas - KPI alignment, predictability analysis, and hypothesis testing. Integration team provided immediate testing opportunities while Advertising team acknowledged limitations in predictive modeling due to DSP changes. Framework development targeting completion within 2-3 weeks with active stakeholder engagement.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Resource constraints within the engineering team are blocking semantic layer implementation despite clear business value and stakeholder demand for AI-powered query capabilities. Neera\'s team requires Russell\'s explicit prioritization to allocate capacity for pipeline and subnet model development, creating a dependency that could delay critical AI chat functionality for business users.

The disconnect between Whitney\'s position and ELT guidance on account health scoring methodology is creating strategic uncertainty that impacts team planning and resource allocation. Despite industry validation and technical feasibility, the fundamental approach remains contested, requiring executive intervention to establish clear direction and avoid continued resource waste.

Amplitude expertise gaps are creating hiring bottlenecks and limiting the team\'s ability to scale experimentation capabilities. Current recruitment pipeline lacks candidates with sufficient depth in both product analytics and A-B testing methodologies, forcing Nanxi to develop internal expertise while managing active partnership demands from Integration and Advertising teams.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Analysis of top content module usage revealed significant efficiency differences between search and profile-based user behaviors. OneSearch drives 47% of copy events with only 27% of users, averaging 38 copies per user weekly, compared to company profile\'s 13% event share despite 25% user adoption. This finding supports product strategy prioritizing search functionality and informs Copilot Pro feature development decisions.

Employee tab analysis within company profiles showed strong performance of recommended filtering algorithms, with users predominantly engaging with suggested contacts rather than browsing manually. This validates the current recommendation engine approach and suggests similar algorithmic support could enhance Copilot Pro\'s contact discovery capabilities.

Cross-team collaboration patterns indicate strong appetite for structured experimentation support, with Integration and Advertising teams immediately engaging on testing opportunities. However, predictive analytics faces significant headwinds due to rapid platform changes and DSP upgrades that invalidate historical modeling assumptions.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Integration team on banner A-B testing continues to be critical for driving platform connection rates. Ferrell is supporting immediate testing needs while Nanxi develops broader hypothesis testing frameworks. The team requires continued product management support to balance immediate tactical testing with strategic framework development.

Coordination with engineering leadership through Nir and Russell remains essential for semantic layer prioritization. The AI chat functionality represents significant business value but requires explicit capacity allocation decisions that balance infrastructure investments against feature development priorities.

# **Core Data Executive Roundup - Week of 08/11 - 08/15**

## **Executive Summary**

The Core Data team uncovered a potential data quality crisis this week, discovering an anomalous contribution of 100 million contacts from CN - two orders of magnitude above normal. Root cause was identified and John Durst immediately initiated impact analysis to protect existing contacts while the team continued executing critical deliverables. Despite this unexpected issue, the team achieved 80% completion on major initiatives including industry model rollout alignment, C-level contact unfreezing, and 2H roadmap finalization, demonstrating exceptional operational resilience under pressure.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Cam Fortin secured stakeholder alignment on a phased industry model rollout strategy, establishing Q1 2026 deployment for companies with \<50 employees and Q2 2026 for larger enterprises. This risk-mitigated approach protects enterprise customer data quality while enabling systematic model improvement through continuous DS/Research involvement and heavy initial gating with gradual automation based on feedback loops.

Rituparna Das successfully unfroze 150K C-level contacts and 150K top companies for automated updates, completing 90% of the critical data maintenance goal. The team analyzed C-level changes with researchers, established review timelines, and advanced title classification with 4.9M contacts gaining department classifications and 19.3M in the pipeline, directly improving customer targeting capabilities.

Peter Overman achieved breakthrough progress on CN Milestone 5, leveraging our data acquisition capabilities to improve previously unpublishable contacts, generating over 500,000 net new person profiles and 800,000 attributes with yields continuing to improve. His newly implemented AI-driven reporting approaches and direct data access through DataDog and BigQuery are creating visibility into web data acquisition impact that previously required weeks of analysis team support.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Industry Model Deployment**: Cam Fortin completed 80% of the alignment goal, securing agreement on the phased rollout timeline and DS/Research continuous involvement model. However, critical risks remain unaddressed: no current plans for review room integration requiring coordination with the company team, and the need to map internal model confidence scores to customer-facing confidence scores as confirmed with Arash.

**Data Quality Operations**: John Durst progressed 80% on multiple fronts - refining industry scope with project leads, updating analysis priorities given headcount changes, and conducting second-round reviews of indistinguishable contacts. The CN contribution anomaly emerged as an urgent priority, potentially affecting contact data integrity and requiring immediate investigation to determine if changes impacted customer-visible data.

**2H Planning & Roadmap**: Peter Overman achieved 90% completion on closing out second-half planning, finalizing priorities with Brian and Roi for GTM Store ingestion including vertical datasets, and aligning with Corina on workbooks enablement roadmap. Direct UX collaboration was established for designing optimal user experiences, eliminating middleman delays.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Magnus Herweyer\'s Shared Services initiative faces critical velocity constraints due to systematic delays in cross-team dependencies. The address normalization PRD development follows a pattern of week-long sprint delays at each handoff point - gap analysis tickets enter sprints a week late, results trigger new tickets entering the following sprint, creating 3-4 week cycles for tasks requiring days of effort. Without dedicated engineering resources focused solely on Shared Services, the team remains dependent on other teams\' prioritization and timelines.

The CN data contribution anomaly represents an immediate operational risk requiring John Durst\'s full attention. With 100 million contacts received versus normal volumes in the millions, the team must determine if duplicate information corrupted existing contact records before the next customer data refresh. This border-line outage scenario demands rapid analysis while maintaining progress on other critical deliverables.

Resource availability continues to impede progress across multiple initiatives. Maria\'s absence for the rest of August impacts job posts backfilling, Roi\'s particular requirements slow vertical dataset naming decisions, and the lack of response from Dal and Andrew on contractor schema blocks Peter Overman\'s progress. These accumulated delays risk pushing GA dates beyond September 2nd targets.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Magnus Herweyer\'s experimentation with Copilot for code analysis revealed a huge potential velocity improvement for understanding existing systems architecture. Rather than waiting 3 weeks for back-and-forth analysis tickets, PMs can achieve 85% complete analysis in hours, requiring shorter engineering validation sessions. This approach could transform how the team handles cross-system dependencies and architectural discovery.

Peter Overman\'s shift to direct data access and AI-assisted analysis demonstrates the multiplicative effect of PM technical empowerment. By pulling data directly from DataDog and rather than waiting for analysis team support, he\'s uncovering insights about web data acquisition impact that enable real-time dashboard creation. This self-service approach, combined with AI tools for pattern recognition, allows PMs to answer strategic questions in hours rather than weeks.

Cam Fortin\'s business memo requirement for the 3.0 transition exposed critical gaps in product-level visibility for customer deliveries. The team lacks systematic tracking of what\'s delivered to each customer and delivery status, operating on anecdotal \"everything\'s good\" feedback. This blind spot becomes critical as the team manages increasingly complex data transformations affecting customer-specific attribute profiles.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

The engineering realignment affecting Casey O\'Rourke\'s availability threatens Shared Services infrastructure development. As the architectural co-creator with Michael Helmeste, Casey\'s involvement is critical for Norm Gateway and Phone Normalization development. Magnus Herweyer requires prioritization with Product leadership to clarify resource allocation amid scattered conversations about who can build what and when which Jody Roberts will be helping to drive.

Integration team dependencies for data sharing infrastructure remain unresolved despite executive escalation. While Heather Ma secured a 3-week timeline estimate for admin portal backend development, the team structure questions between DOS6 and DOS12 create uncertainty about actual resource allocation. Without clear ownership designation from Erica, multiple PM priorities compete for the same engineering resources.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week demands parallel crisis management and strategic execution as the team addresses the CN data anomaly while maintaining momentum on Q3 deliverables.

John Durst will lead the critical CN impact analysis, determining whether the 100 million contact anomaly corrupted existing customer data while establishing alerting mechanisms to prevent future occurrences. Simultaneously, he\'ll gather DS team feedback on industry alignment to achieve full consensus by week\'s end. Magnus Herweyer will leverage newly acquired Copilot access to accelerate PRD creation for address normalization, aiming to compress the typical 3-week analysis cycle into days while pursuing executive clarity on Shared Services resourcing.

Peter Overman faces multiple time-sensitive deliverables: accelerating job posts backfilling through creative UI workarounds if engineering capacity remains blocked, finalizing contractor schema requirements with or without Dal and Andrew\'s input, and expanding the AI-driven impact measurement framework across all web data acquisition initiatives. The team\'s ability to navigate resource constraints while protecting data quality will determine whether September\'s GA targets remain achievable or require strategic replanning.

The team is sharing the account-specific release notes and roadmap agent on Tuesday, demonstrating concrete value for personalized customer interactions.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Automated Documentation Implementation**: Daniel Kong finalized the knowledge center refresh workflow with the CX team, establishing a two-part process where Product Ops provides content scanning and CX handles writing with their specific formatting requirements. August serves as the first live test for automated implementation guide updates, with PM-managed processes supported by AI agents.

**Product Feature Knowledge Foundation**: Kristin Gandini advanced the product knowledge base POC, analyzing support tickets and Docket questions to identify content gaps for product feature knowledge management. This work runs parallel to the product marketing focused knowledge graph, addressing different use cases and information requirements for internal teams.

**Knowledge Graph Infrastructure**: Sam Darcy continued system refinement with dedicated GCP sandbox infrastructure, focusing on improving processing quality and relationship mapping. The foundational architecture supports both current GTM Studio needs and future expansion to additional use cases.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Google Slides Creator Integration Issues**: Ken Elwell encountered significant inconsistencies with the new Google Slides creator beta feature, producing good initial results followed by poor subsequent outputs. This technical instability creates uncertainty for delivering polished presentation materials to the AM team on schedule.

**Out-of-Office Coverage Planning**: Brett and Daniel\'s absence next week requires careful coordination to ensure August release materials are completed and implementation guide updates proceed smoothly. Kristin will need to support implementation guide publishing while managing her other priorities.

**Product Feature Knowledge Complexity**: The challenge of managing product feature knowledge at scale requires different approaches than marketing-focused content. The complexity of technical documentation, feature interactions, and rapid update cycles demands systematic solutions beyond current manual processes.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Process Maturation Delivers Consistency**: The second consecutive smooth MCR demonstrates that the process improvements implemented over recent months are creating sustainable workflows. This consistency reduces firefighting and allows focus on higher-value automation initiatives.

**Separate Knowledge Systems Serve Different Needs**: The distinction between product marketing focused knowledge graphs and product feature knowledge management reflects different use cases, update frequencies, and accuracy requirements. Each system requires tailored approaches rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.

**Agentic Layer Deployment Flexibility**: The learning that we don\'t necessarily need to immediately connect the agentic layer into the knowledge graph provides deployment flexibility. Static outputs can provide immediate value while more complex integrations develop over time.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

The CX team collaboration on knowledge center automation is proceeding well with clear role definitions and workflow boundaries. The Thursday alignment meeting successfully established the division of responsibilities between automated scanning and human writing oversight.

Sam\'s work continues to depend on the semantic data team\'s API development timeline, though the dedicated GCP infrastructure provides more control over other system components and reduces external dependencies.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on maintaining momentum during leadership transitions while making critical progress on product feature knowledge management systems.

**Critical Knowledge Management Priority**: We really need to crack product feature knowledge management to support both internal teams and customer-facing documentation. This challenge requires systematic approaches to technical content, feature relationships, and rapid update cycles that current manual processes cannot sustain. And need significant improvement for knowledge graph now that we tested it live

**Personalization:** Continue improving and pushing account personalization for reps

**Coverage and Continuation**: With Brett and Daniel out, Kristin will coordinate implementation guide publishing and advance product knowledge POC development. Ken will continue AM team testing and prepare for Tuesday\'s agent sharing session. Sam will focus on knowledge graph refinement and system improvement.

The team demonstrates increasing operational maturity with successful process execution and strategic system development progressing in parallel. The focus on cracking product feature knowledge management represents the next critical milestone for comprehensive AI-driven knowledge infrastructure.
