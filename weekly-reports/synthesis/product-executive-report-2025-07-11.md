**Intelligence Team:** \"Danny Pan\'s API processing reached 70K ACV accounts despite infrastructure challenges, revealing sparse engagement data across customer accounts---e.g. showing only 200 calls for 300 accounts over three months. This discovery illuminates retention risks and creates separate opportunities for predictive modeling around engagement frequency and renewal probability.\"

### **Operational Velocity (Operating at AI-company speed vs SaaS speed)**

**Product Ops Team:** \"July release materials are complete and going out today. Sam\'s VOC tool is stuck in deployment with a 16-person Slack thread - the company is not set up for internal innovation - will likely need escalation. Kristin finished planning one-pagers across all PM teams - everyone aligned on deliverables through August 1st. Critical issue: we spent 50% of our time tracking people down for basic tasks instead of building. Need to seriously reinvest our energy in improving the AI PMM system to eliminate this waste.\"

**Admin Team:** \"This week, Jessie Lindstrom spearheaded significant progress in establishing clear reporting needs for pricing, packaging, and seating, culminating in a validated requirements document and a review with engineering. This critical work, which has identified five key reporting gaps and secured timing commitments for the top two, is essential for accurate usage-based pricing and revenue operations, directly supporting key business decisions. Josh Simon has made strides in finalizing the new pricing flow designs, securing new designs based on stakeholder feedback, and preparing for Jira ticket creation, which is vital for maintaining MQL integrity and correct account manager assignment. Brannen Huske achieved 70% completion on finalizing the base pricing decision, moving forward with building the system around the AI action price book and getting packaging and pricing for the platform section into the POC. A key decision needed is continued executive support in prioritizing these initiatives, especially given cross-functional dependencies and the need to address data categorization blind spots.\"

**Product DAI Team:** \"The team is executing but constrained by foundational blockers. Query layer dependencies are paralyzing multiple critical workstreams including CRM enhancements, custom fields, and dataset development. Meanwhile, GTM Plays has \'too many cooks\' with 12 people in planning meetings but unclear ownership and timelines. AI Audiences finally has engineering resources assigned and development beginning, but we\'re still in requirements stage for most datasets rather than dev-ready work.\"

This critical work, which has identified five key reporting gaps and secured timing commitments for the top two, is essential for accurate usage-based pricing and revenue operations, directly supporting key business decisions. **Josh Simon** has made strides in finalizing the new pricing flow designs, securing new designs based on stakeholder feedback, and preparing for Jira ticket creation, which is vital for maintaining MQL integrity and correct account manager assignment. **Brannen Huske** achieved 70% completion on finalizing the base pricing decision, moving forward with building the system around the AI action price book and getting packaging and pricing for the platform section into the POC. A key decision needed is continued executive support in prioritizing these initiatives, especially given cross-functional dependencies and the need to address data categorization blind spots.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Jessie Lindstrom** successfully drafted a comprehensive requirements document for pricing, packaging, and seating reporting, validating it with business stakeholders. This is a crucial step in enabling accurate reporting on usage-based pricing models and ensuring that our revenue operations are supported by reliable data, directly impacting our ability to make informed business decisions.

**Josh Simon** led productive meetings with RevOps and SDR stakeholders, resulting in new designs for the pricing base flow. This progress is vital for ensuring that the flow correctly assigns account managers and CSMs, guaranteeing that the right content reaches the right people at the right time, thus preserving MQL integrity.

**Brannen Huske** advanced the base pricing decision to 70% completion, progressing on building the system around the AI action price book and integrating packaging and pricing for the platform section into the POC. This work is fundamental for the strategic implementation of new pricing models.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Brannen Huske**: The goal to finalize the base pricing decision is 70% complete. While a final decision on currency is pending Adam Smith\'s return (out until the 16th) and Mark\'s finalization, the team is proceeding with building the rest of the system around the AI action price book. Packaging and pricing for the platform section and POC are being submitted to Melissa today.

**Pricing & Reporting Initiatives**: **Jessie Lindstrom** has advanced significantly on defining reporting needs for pricing, packaging, and seats. A requirements document was created and validated with business stakeholders, identifying five key reporting gaps. A review with engineering was conducted this week to get estimates for all five and timing commitments for the top two, putting us on track for accurate usage-based pricing data.

**New Pricing Flow Design**: **Josh Simon** is nearing finalization of the designs for the new pricing base flow. Meetings with RevOps and SDR stakeholder groups provided critical feedback, leading to updated designs. The next step is to generate Jira tickets, moving this initiative closer to implementation and ensuring proper MQL handling and account manager assignments.

### **Strategic Challenges**

A primary challenge identified by **Jessie Lindstrom** is the **\"blind spot\" around legal proof of delivery or SKU implications of usage-based pricing options**. This directly impacts how the usage-based monetization is built to avoid business issues and requires close collaboration with the PII committee to understand pricing implications. Furthermore, there\'s uncertainty about what needs to change upstream in Salesforce and teams\' capacity to handle technical requirements, making the engineering review crucial for feedback.

**Josh Simon** highlighted a \"blind spot\" concerning **how things are categorized in Salesforce and how different forms lead to different places**. This lack of complete understanding in data categorization poses a risk to accurate reporting and efficient workflows, as it can lead to miscategorized login issues or incorrect data routing if not addressed. Additionally, **Josh Simon** experienced a significant time stretch due to competing priorities, including planning for H2 login and privacy goals and spending 5-15 hours reviewing calls for the real NPS report, which did not move other goals forward.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Jessie Lindstrom**\'s work on reporting highlighted the critical need for accurate package and usage reporting, especially for usage-based pricing. The discovery of five specific reporting gaps, with a focus on gaining engineering estimates and timing commitments for the top two, emphasizes that data infrastructure is paramount for strategic pricing decisions. A key learning from the engineering review is the \"blocker\" of ownership regarding business logic and data transformation for definitive packaging.

**Josh Simon**\'s efforts to finalize new pricing flow designs revealed the deep investment of RevOps and SDR stakeholders in maintaining MQL integrity and ensuring correct account manager/CSM assignment. This reinforced the importance of user flow accuracy and careful categorization within Salesforce to avoid lost MQLs and ensure timely content delivery. **Josh Simon** also learned about significant miscommunication and lack of coordination for customer communications amongst marketing teams, particularly regarding SSO adoption and 2FA pushes, indicating a lack of a single process for these non-code releases. This leads to him having to individually follow up with parties, which is time-consuming and leads to dropped balls. He also realized that when making UI changes on the login page, marketing and leads stakeholders need to be involved earlier to avoid back and forth at the end of the process.

**Brannen Huske** learned that revenue reporting depends on whether a customer budget expires at the end of a subscription or rolls over, a question Mark is currently addressing with the ELT group. Additionally, Commerce Services is building a revenue reporting service through Stripe, and there is a need to align on whether to use Stripe or report directly to SAP, with pros and cons to both, likely depending on the budget expiration decision.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the **engineering team** on reporting needs, specifically for pricing, packaging, and seats, continues to be critical for enabling accurate usage-based pricing and revenue operations. **Jessie Lindstrom**\'s upcoming review with engineering for estimates and timing commitments on the five identified reporting gaps is essential. Resolving the ownership of business logic and data transformation for definitive packaging is a critical dependency, with Jessie pushing for the data team to own this transformation.

Collaboration with the **PII committee** is crucial for understanding the legal proof of delivery or SKU implications of usage-based pricing to avoid business issues. **Brannen Huske** needs to meet with **Andrew Levy**, who owns Stripe, and **Garrett Cummins**, who owns the SAP connection, to align on revenue reporting methods. **Josh Simon** highlighted dependencies on marketing and leads teams for UI changes on the login page, emphasizing the need for earlier stakeholder involvement to avoid late-stage back and forth.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week, the team will primarily focus on translating finalized designs into actionable development tickets, securing critical engineering commitments, and addressing key alignment issues for pricing and reporting.

**Brannen Huske** aims to secure alignment on the AI budget early next week, with Mark expected to have an answer today. He will also meet with Andrew Levy and Garrett Cummins to align on revenue reporting, and work with Brenna and Lauren McHugh on NPI and tickets to advance packaging.

**Jessie Lindstrom** will focus on getting alignment and ownership for the data transformation of product and add-on data to actual packages. She created a diagram to articulate her POV of the source of truth for the 5 reporting gaps, which will be reviewed today within the platform team. The goal is to ensure each system acts as a source of truth feeding into the BI tool, rather than solely relying on the platform for all transformations.

**Josh Simon** will concentrate on finalizing Jira tickets and designs for the pricing page flow, with the goal of getting it into the next sprint. This will enable the team to start development work and address the categorization blind spot in Salesforce.

The team remains confident in delivering significant value, but continued executive awareness and support for cross-functional dependencies, especially with engineering, legal, and marketing teams, will be crucial in accelerating progress.

This plan enables both Advanced Search delivery and strategic ICP deprecation in favor of intelligent ML-driven prioritization.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Advanced Search Integration**: Menna achieved 100% completion on AFS current state analysis, identifying three potential paths forward with the preferred solution being GTM Data Model integration. The team discovered that AFS was previously integrated behind a feature flag but never enabled due to duplicate tagging where companies appeared in multiple fit segments. Next week\'s focus shifts to partnering with AI Enterprise team to define the onboarding path for AFS into the GTM Data Model.

**Unified Profile Architecture**: Adwait completed alignment sessions with Operations teams and achieved consensus between Data and AI Engineering teams on output schema general direction. The unified profile approach directly addresses SDR pain points around duplicate contact tracking in Salesforce, as confirmed by Henry\'s recent survey findings. Next week the team will analyze a proposal to have a generic unified profile entity that will serve as the standard entity for all Unified Profiles.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Resource allocation unpredictability continues to impact planning effectiveness, with engineering teams maintaining open capacity for shifting priorities mid-cycle. Adwait\'s engineering crew faces tight constraints with competing demands from multiple workstreams, making fixed monthly planning difficult when workbook requirements remain fluid and can redirect resources without advance notice.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The current operations workflow expects duplicates by design, primarily because provisioning systems rely on them for various processes. However, the future unified profile approach with a unique \'golden\' record will serve as a single source of truth, validating our platform hypothesis and reinforcing the MVP direction. This discovery positions the team to leverage Unified Profiles to mitigate these duplicates by design. Ideally, the internal ZI provisioning systems wouldn\'t create duplicate Accounts in the first place, but we\'ll see similar scenarios with most customers.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our collaboration with the AI Enterprise team on AFS onboarding to the GTM Data Model is now critical for unlocking Advanced Search production delivery. This partnership will eliminate the root cause of duplicate tagging issues while aligning with long-term platform direction, requiring coordination on implementation timeline and resource allocation.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s primary focus centers on finalizing architectural decisions and accelerating implementation planning across all three major workstreams. The team will lock in GTM Data Model integration approaches while maintaining momentum on unified profile development and Advanced Search production readiness.

Top priorities include partnering with the AI Enterprise team to define the AFS onboarding path, collaborating with UI Design team to scope Milestone 1.6 requirements for unified profile, and completing the architectural review for federated vs. direct API access. Success depends on resolving ownership boundaries quickly while keeping all stakeholders aligned on implementation sequencing.

The team enters next week with strong momentum on strategic initiatives, clear validation of platform direction from internal customers, and concrete solutions to longstanding technical blockers. With architectural decisions landing and procurement obstacles addressed, the Data Platform team is positioned to accelerate delivery across all major workstreams while maintaining focus on foundational platform capabilities.

# **Integrations Executive Roundup - Week of July 7, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

*The Integrations team delivered critical progress on three strategic fronts this week, with Prateek Paikray achieving 100% completion on Salesforce Agent Force requirements and Erica Fienman advancing dynamic mapping designs to 90% completion with engineering review. However, we need executive attention on securing committed sprint dates from engineering teams across multiple initiatives, as requirements are finalized but delivery timelines remain uncommitted, creating risk for H2 deliverables including the August 1st engagement data availability promise.*

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

*Prateek Paikray completed all functional requirements and lucid chart documentation for the Salesforce Agent Force integration, successfully navigating authentication challenges and establishing bi-weekly collaboration calls with Salesforce\'s principal architect team. This positions us well for the critical July 31st package submission deadline required for Dreamforce availability.*

*Erica Fienman achieved significant breakthrough on dynamic mapping with 90% completion of requirements and preliminary designs reviewed with engineering, covering three key use cases: creating records from custom fields, appending custom objects to existing GTM records, and full custom-to-GTM object mapping. The designs provide sufficient context for engineering sizing conversations scheduled for next week.*

*Sanyog Rai reached 90% completion on both engagement data upsert API requirements and schema finalization for content interactions table, with all main requirements completed and reviewed with engineering teams. The remaining 10% focuses on securing final engineering sign-offs and timeline commitments.*

### **Goals & Progress**

**Salesforce Integration Initiatives**: Andres Perez made substantial progress on the prototype for direct Salesforce API access through agent layer, successfully identifying all team dependencies and creating JIRA tickets for four separate teams. While the technical approach is validated, the initiative remains at 60% due to need for committed sprint dates from prompt service, agent service, and MCP server teams.

**UpLead API Development**: Both CRM accounts endpoint (Erica) and content interactions endpoint (Sanyog) reached 90% completion with requirements finalized and engineering reviews completed. The remaining gap is securing committed delivery timelines from engineering, with a dedicated engineering alignment meeting scheduled for Wednesday to resolve this blocker.

**GTM Data Model Enhancement**: Prateek achieved 100% completion on UUID field implementation with workflow complete and ZDP team deployment scheduled for Tuesday. Schema updates for engagement tables are 90% complete pending final engineering counterpart sign-offs from David and Jerome on field definitions and table creation timelines.

### **Strategic Challenges**

*Engineering commitment remains our primary strategic challenge across multiple workstreams. While product requirements are consistently reaching 90%+ completion, the gap between \"requirements reviewed\" and \"committed sprint dates\" is creating delivery uncertainty for H2 priorities. Sanyog identified this pattern affects both upsert API work and schema finalization, where engineering teams need additional time to provide concrete delivery commitments.*

*Cross-timezone coordination continues impacting velocity, particularly between Israel-based and West Coast engineering teams. Sanyog noted this disconnect is already slowing the upsert API project despite clear requirements, suggesting need for more structured engineering-to-engineering communication protocols rather than product-to-product handoffs.*

*Resource allocation pressure is emerging with Prateek being pulled into the new Salesforce Agent Force package development while maintaining existing marketplace and integration responsibilities. This creates potential focus dilution across critical Q3 deliverables, though the Agent Force work aligns with broader integration strategy.*

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

*The team discovered significant gaps in AI agent implementation standards through Andres\'s real-world experience with an AC company using AI agents without proper guardrails. Three different AI voices claimed to be human, made pricing commitments, and scheduled appointments without human oversight, resulting in complete service failure. This validates our need for clear AI agent boundaries and transparency requirements in our own implementations.*

*Engineering-to-engineering communication proves more effective than product-to-product handoffs for complex technical requirements. Sanyog\'s observation about workbooks team requesting date fields versus datetime fields revealed that product teams are making technical decisions without engineering validation, creating downstream implementation issues that could be avoided with direct technical consultation.*

*The Salesforce prospecting center integration revealed market reality with fewer than 20 Salesforce customers actually using the feature, despite significant development investment. This learning reinforces the importance of market validation before major integration investments and supports our pivot toward Agent Force as the primary Salesforce strategy.*

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

*Our work with engineering teams on upsert API delivery requires immediate escalation to secure committed sprint dates. Erica is scheduling a Wednesday alignment meeting with Ray\'s team to resolve the gap between requirements completion and delivery commitment. The August 1st engagement data availability promise depends on this resolution.*

*Collaboration with the search team on UUID field requirements needs direct engineering coordination. Prateek identified that the enterprise search team\'s specific format requirements for GTM object querying haven\'t been fully validated against our current engagement ID implementation, requiring immediate technical alignment to avoid rework.*

## **Looking Ahead**

*Next week focuses on converting requirements completion into committed delivery timelines across all major initiatives. Our primary objective is securing sprint dates for Salesforce connector actions, upsert API endpoints, and schema updates to unblock Q3 deliverables.*

*Andres will drive cross-team commitment for the Salesforce Agent Force prototype, requiring coordination between prompt service, agent service, and MCP server teams. Success here enables the workbooks beta customer use cases and validates our agent-based integration approach. Simultaneously, Erica and Sanyog will leverage their Wednesday engineering meeting to establish concrete delivery timelines for upsert API work, directly addressing the August 1st engagement data commitment.*

*The team maintains strong momentum with multiple initiatives at 90%+ completion, positioning us well for Q3 delivery once engineering commitments are secured. Our focus on committed dates over requirements refinement reflects lessons learned about the gap between technical feasibility and delivery certainty.*

# **Intelligence Team Executive Roundup - July 11, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The Intelligence Team achieved critical momentum this week on three fronts: copilot v2 prototype development targeting Monday delivery, 50% completion of semantic data processing down to \$70K accounts, and architectural clarity on context engineering that will accelerate agent development. The decision to defer centralized context service development in favor of rapid agent prototyping represents a short-term pivot that will enable faster learning cycles while supporting August & September release. Cross-functional alignment with workbooks and profiles teams positions us for unified product demonstration to leadership next week.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Lars Vedo successfully transformed blank canvas to comprehensive swim lanes with milestones and interdependencies, while the agentic platform achieved public endpoint deployment enabling chrome plugin distribution. With 36 open PRs in a shortened week and engineers creating functional demos, the platform adoption velocity exceeded expectations.

Ryan McMaster\'s copilot prototype merges sales hub functionality with existing patterns, creating a canvas surface in the middle pane that mirrors perplexity-style interactions. This convergence of previously disparate features addresses the fragmentation concerns raised last week and provides multiple UI patterns for product team evaluation on Monday.

Danny Pan\'s API processing reached 70K ACV accounts despite infrastructure challenges, revealing sparse engagement data across customer accounts\-\--e.g. showing only 200 calls for 300 accounts over three months. This discovery illuminates retention risks and creates separate opportunities for predictive modeling around engagement frequency and renewal probability.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Copilot V2 Development**: Ryan\'s prototype development progresses toward Monday deadline with focus on real data integration using Grok 4 for authentic request/response demonstrations. The workbooks team\'s chat artifacts pattern will merge with copilot\'s inline display capabilities, creating optionality between perplexity-style right panel and integrated canvas approaches. Functional prototype philosophy ensures robust testing environment beyond typical figma limitations.

**Data Processing & Automation**: Danny\'s team processed over 50% of target accounts despite API box reset bugs that interrupt automation flows. Current session architecture enables automatic recovery through retriggered runs, maintaining progress while root cause investigation continues. Transition from batch processing to selective account list reading positions team for automated deployment next week.

**Platform Architecture & Planning**: Lars delivered comprehensive planning documentation including press release drafts and jira epic structure for platform and copilot initiatives. SDK adoption shows strong uptake with demos from both product managers and engineers, while chorus team reaches production readiness pending access token resolution. Public endpoint deployment removes VPN requirements, accelerating adoption timeline.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Rowan identified architectural decision points around context service design / build, ultimately choosing a decentralized approach to maintain velocity. Building agents first with simple Python API clients to understand actual context requirements\-\--rather than anticipating all potential issues with quality, size, latency, and refresh rates\-\--this enables empirical learning while avoiding premature optimization and creating drag. This decision requires careful monitoring to ensure technical debt doesn\'t accumulate beyond the September GA deadline.

Danny\'s engagement ingestion automation faces persistent API box reset issues that, while not blocking progress due to session recovery mechanisms, prevent full automation deployment. The sparse data discovery\-\--many accounts showing minimal engagement over three-month periods\-\--raises fundamental questions about customer health monitoring and proactive intervention strategies. Without quarterly touchpoints minimum, retention risk increases substantially.

Lars navigates complex dependencies across multiple teams for copilot v2 success: GTM data model alignment progressing but still open questions there, RBAC integration not yet initiated, and collaboration features threatening scope creep. The Wednesday PRD review with Dominic and Adam represents a critical alignment checkpoint where task deprioritization and new feature additions will face scrutiny.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Rowan\'s context engineering primer provides conceptual clarity essential for aligned agent development. The revelation that premature centralization would slow velocity without empirical requirements validates a more iterative approach, where each agent implementation informs architectural patterns.

Danny\'s data analysis exposed concerning engagement patterns: processing 300 accounts yields only 200 calls over three months, suggesting many customers receive minimal attention post-sale. This quantitative validation of suspected retention challenges creates a clear need for Arash and Robyn\'s recommendation engine development focused on engagement frequency optimization.

Lars and team discovered strong demand for collaborative features in seller workflows\-\--artifacts, notes, and views require sharing capabilities or users will resort to Google Docs. Building collaboration primitives from inception rather than retrofitting represents architectural decision with long-term implications for platform adoption.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our integration with workbooks team on chat artifact patterns continues evolving through Ryan\'s prototype work, requiring alignment on display paradigms before Monday\'s demonstration. The profiles team\'s copilot chat implementation on public URL removes deployment blockers, but citing sources functionality requires fast-track development over next three weeks to meet launch requirements.

Platform SDK adoption by chorus team demonstrates successful abstraction layer, though security requirements around access tokens remain unresolved. Grant and Asher\'s onboarding to semantic data service performance work initiates critical scalability effort\-\--multiple architecture options under RFC review with decision deadline mid-next week to maintain September multi-tenant readiness.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on three convergent demonstrations: Ryan\'s copilot prototype on Monday, comprehensive PRD review Wednesday, and Friday\'s agentic AI team demos.

Memory service exploration with Josh, Grant, and Ryan next week.

Zero-config philosophy to context in GTM Config was also discussed\-\--leveraging existing integration data to impress administrators before they refine or supplement.

Context engineering team requires deliberate use case prioritization to channel enthusiasm from platform adoption into highest-impact agent development. Without stack ranking, parallel efforts risk divergence when convergence drives compound value. September GA timeline demands disciplined execution balanced with learning velocity that decentralized architecture enables.

# **Apps Executive Roundup - Monday July 7th - Friday July 11th**

## **Executive Summary**

Critical Action Required: The Apps team is operating at 80% capacity with significant delivery risks emerging. Two major transitions are happening simultaneously - Vinay\'s departure (last day July 18th) and Gabe\'s onboarding to AI Emailer ownership - while core product initiatives face delayed timelines. The team delivered on tactical execution but strategic initiatives are stalling due to resource constraints and external dependencies.

Marketing Qualified Accounts integration with Copilot has revealed fundamental platform limitations that require immediate roadmap attention. Custom Signals are broken and don\'t support the custom attributes most internal teams need. Meanwhile, Go-to-Market Studio launch preparations are progressing but blocked on pricing decisions and executive alignment cycles.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Transition Management Shows Strong Execution: Gabe achieved 100% completion on AI Emailer onboarding, conducting comprehensive stakeholder meetings with Corina, engineering, design, and research teams. His systematic approach to understanding in-progress work and forming opinionated views demonstrates the team\'s ability to execute smooth leadership transitions under pressure.

Product Marketing Processes Evolving Rapidly: Lauren\'s pricing survey delivered immediate insights within 24 hours, revealing that customers strongly prefer soft limits with overages rather than hard cutoffs for AI features. However, preferences on credit-based versus monetary pricing models were evenly split, indicating market uncertainty that gives us flexibility in pricing strategy decisions.

Pre-Copilot Experience Maintains Momentum: Vinay successfully moved Phase 1 into testing with all major blockers resolved. The systematic approach to ticket refinement and dependency management has kept this critical customer experience work on track despite organizational turbulence.

### **Goals & Progress**

Go-to-Market Studio Launch (80% Complete): Jennifer delivered a reviewable pitch deck by end of day Friday, incorporating Dominic\'s feedback on data waterfall education and internal AI systems usage. The deck represents a significant milestone but faces another round of intensive feedback cycles. The team learned that AI-generated content requires substantial human refinement for executive-level materials - initial outlines can be AI-generated but 80% of the real work comes from human-driven edits and feedback loops.

Intelligence Network Pricing Implementation (Blocked): Two-week delay in receiving feedback from Mark Harris on pricing and incentive structures has created downstream planning issues. The team escalated pricing decision conflicts between Dominic/Brandon and Mark directly to leadership rather than playing middleman - a smart tactical move that demonstrates mature stakeholder management.

Intent Topic Recommendation (75% Complete but Delayed): Originally scheduled for July 15th launch, now pushed to August due to data science team reorganization. However, the team made significant progress on instrumentation and discovered critical gaps in analytics infrastructure that require immediate attention.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Platform Infrastructure Limitations Are Becoming Critical Blockers: The Marketing Qualified Accounts investigation revealed that Custom Signals are fundamentally broken - they don\'t work in workflows and don\'t support custom attributes on standard objects. This isn\'t just a feature limitation; it\'s a platform capability gap that affects multiple internal teams\' ability to leverage our own tools effectively. The team documented these limitations clearly, but resolving them requires engineering resources that may not be available.

Resource Constraints Are Compounding Across Multiple Workstreams: Al\'s advanced search work is delayed because the assigned UX designer has been sick for two weeks. Team 21 engineering resources are reduced due to military obligations in Israel. The data science team reorganization has created bottlenecks for intent-related features. These aren\'t isolated incidents - they represent a pattern of resource fragility that\'s impacting delivery across the board.

New Copilot Demo Initiative Has Fundamental Design Flaws: The proposed demo that bypasses all entitlements and uses temporary tokens has never been attempted before at ZoomInfo. Al identified significant risks: many sales clients have only 6 topics, making it unlikely that clusters will appear with sufficient signal strength to demonstrate value. The team is spending considerable design effort on what may be an unviable approach.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Analytics Infrastructure Requires Immediate Standardization: While instrumenting the new topic recommendation feature, the team discovered that our event naming and properties are inconsistent across platforms, with similar events duplicated and fragmented. This isn\'t just a data quality issue - it\'s creating development inefficiencies and making it difficult to assess what analytics capabilities already exist versus what needs to be built. The team proposed an AI-powered event management application to solve this systematically.

Monthly Customer Release Process Still Needs Narrative Structure: Despite efforts to scale back and work more efficiently, the team learned that sellers still need thematic narratives rather than just feature lists. The three-pillar approach (Data Universe, Ecosystem, Admin & Applications) with high-level narratives proved effective and can be delivered scalably using AI-generated slide templates. This validates that product marketing still plays a critical role in value-based storytelling.

Product Marketing Resource Model Requires Recalibration: Harry\'s experience with the new PMM process revealed significant manual steps and gaps in supporting beta/phased rollouts. The process works for standard launches but breaks down for complex initiatives. Meanwhile, the team is handling traditional PMM responsibilities (enablement, analyst briefings, battle cards, pricing discussions) while also driving product innovation - a scope that may be unsustainable.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Intelligence Network pricing involves complex coordination between RevOps, Sales, and Legal teams that extends beyond typical product development cycles. The team appropriately escalated pricing conflicts between leadership rather than attempting to resolve them independently. However, this creates planning uncertainty that cascades through multiple launch milestones.

The advanced search roadmap depends heavily on the GTM Data Model team for expanded data access, but coordination meetings are still being scheduled. Given the Microsoft accessibility requirements and August renewal timeline, any delays in this dependency could have significant customer retention implications.

## **Looking Ahead**

Critical Transition Period Requires Executive Attention: With Vinay\'s departure July 18th and Victor taking over his responsibilities, the team faces a compressed knowledge transfer window during peak summer vacation season. The handover documentation is well-prepared, but the complexity of ongoing initiatives (pre-copilot phases, profiles transition to Ant, Marketing Qualified Accounts integration) requires careful orchestration to prevent delivery gaps.

Platform Capability Gaps Must Be Addressed Before They Become Bigger Problems: The Custom Signals limitations discovered this week represent a broader pattern of platform infrastructure not keeping pace with business needs. These gaps affect our ability to use our own tools effectively and limit what we can deliver to customers. Engineering leadership needs to prioritize platform foundational work alongside feature development.

Resource Allocation Decisions Are Becoming Urgent: Multiple workstreams are at risk due to resource constraints - UX design coverage for advanced search, data science capacity for intent features, engineering bandwidth for platform improvements. The team is managing these constraints well tactically, but strategic decisions about prioritization and resource allocation are needed to prevent further delays.

The team demonstrated strong execution discipline this week, but the combination of transition pressures, platform limitations, and resource constraints is creating a perfect storm that requires immediate executive attention and decision-making to prevent strategic initiatives from stalling further.

# **Data Team Executive Roundup - Monday July 7th - Friday July 11th**

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Brandon Tucker delivered breakthrough identity resolution capabilities with visitor resolution rates hitting all-time highs and IP2Company resolution jumping 11% through 5x5 integration. FormComplete vs Resolution dashboard is live (team was already on top of it), providing the monitoring foundation we\'ve desperately needed for quality control as we scale.

Dana Hurtig executed flawless hierarchy cleanup by automatically detecting and correcting 20,000+ orphaned subsidiary companies using description-based automation. The team realigned processes around Ethan Young\'s new company definition, with Research leadership expressing enthusiasm for database-wide rollout. This systematic approach eliminated significant data quality issues that have plagued customer integrations.

Brandon Wilson achieved full signal generation automation for semantic-data-enhanced signals, delivering test results to Account Managers for 20 accounts with actual upcoming renewals. Early AM feedback indicates these signals are substantially more relevant than previous iterations, representing a major leap forward in signal quality and relevance.

### **Goals & Progress**

Identity Graph Optimization (90% complete): Brandon Tucker\'s VRS/ID Graph work reached 90% completion with MAID-based identifier integration underway and comprehensive accuracy testing frameworks established. The FormComplete-based monitoring system is operational, though row-by-row accuracy analysis and buyer group segmentation remain pending. This positions us for aggressive coverage expansion with quality controls in place.

Company Definition Implementation (90% complete): Ethan Young\'s company definition work landed strongly with Anne\'s team showing \"excitement and eagerness\" for database rollout. Customer validation remains the final gate, with DaaS team coordination needed to identify initial conversation targets. The definition work has already enabled Dana\'s hierarchy cleanup success and should unlock significant database improvements.

Roadmap Consolidation (90% complete): Jody Roberts advanced H2 roadmap planning despite acknowledging the team is \"doing too much.\" The agentic platform discovery emerged as a powerful accelerator for delivering 80% solutions faster than traditional development cycles. New PM onboarding for shared services is underway, though prioritization clarity remains essential.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Our compliance infrastructure is hostage to cross-functional politics. Rob Priore\'s OneTrust banner work achieved 0% completion because marketing leadership unilaterally extended cookie suppression testing without consulting the data team. This isn\'t about technical complexity - it\'s about marketing making compliance decisions that put the company at regulatory risk. We\'ve confirmed that website cookie loading issues are reducing lead flow, yet we\'re operating in a compliance gray area while marketing runs experiments.

Critical infrastructure systems lack clear ownership and are rotting. The CN Admin Panel has been broken for months with \"disparate ownership and maintenance over time\" creating a situation where \"no one has owned the solution.\" Hannan\'s team has been identified as the best engineering owner, but they need explicit prioritization to make progress. This pattern of infrastructure neglect is creating compound reliability issues across multiple systems.

Our company pipeline is frozen indefinitely, blocking fundamental data operations. Dana\'s team cannot add new companies due to pipeline uncertainty, creating a bottleneck that affects everything downstream. We have \"low risk\" new company addition options available, but need engineering and product alignment to proceed. This freeze represents strategic paralysis rather than technical constraints.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The lead flow mystery is solved, but the solution is blocked. We definitively traced the 30% reduction in demo requests to website cookie loading issues - not OneTrust implementation as originally suspected. Product management in Israel is working on the technical fix, but we\'re still operating with suspended compliance controls due to marketing\'s extended testing. This represents a 9-month problem that was solvable but got lost in organizational complexity.

Enterprise customers are demanding person-based resolution outside of Co-pilot. Disney and Workday have expressed strong interest in centralized person-based resolution for scale activation, not just front-line Co-pilot usage. This represents significant untapped revenue opportunity if we can deliver API integration for Websights and GTM Studio. The technical capability exists - we need product prioritization and engineering cycles to unlock the revenue.

Process documentation is solving parallel dataset development chaos. Dow Jones achieved 100% completion on team operating model implementation, creating clear guidance for multiple simultaneous dataset development streams. Early contractor cube signals from GTM show \"several demos booked,\" validating the approach. This suggests our custom dataset strategy can scale if we maintain process discipline.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with engineering teams on CN Admin Panel ownership has stalled due to prioritization confusion rather than technical constraints. Hannan\'s team is identified as the best owner, but they need explicit executive mandate to take on this infrastructure work. Without clear prioritization, this critical system will continue degrading while teams avoid ownership responsibility.

Marketing leadership\'s unilateral compliance decisions are creating regulatory risk and blocking data team progress. The cookie banner suppression extension demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of compliance requirements. We need executive clarity on who owns compliance decisions and how cross-functional experimentation should work without compromising regulatory protection.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s success depends on breaking through organizational gridlock, not technical challenges. Three issues require immediate executive intervention: (1) Marketing must commit to compliance timeline restoration, (2) Engineering must assign clear CN Admin Panel ownership with prioritization, and (3) Product must unfreeze the company pipeline with explicit go/no-go criteria.

The technical foundation is solid and ready for aggressive scaling. Brandon Tucker\'s identity resolution improvements, Dana\'s hierarchy cleanup success, and Brandon Wilson\'s signal automation represent months of foundational work reaching maturity. We have monitoring systems, quality controls, and automation frameworks in place. The bottleneck is now organizational alignment and resource allocation rather than technical capability.

Our custom dataset strategy is proving its revenue potential. The contractor cube early success and strong enterprise interest in person-based resolution suggest we\'re building the right capabilities. However, we need faster go-to-market execution and clearer prioritization to capitalize on these opportunities. The technical delivery is exceeding expectations - the organizational support needs to match that velocity.

# **Plays + Audiences Executive Roundup - 07/07/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The Plays initiative completed a critical milestone with the H2 one-pager finalized and ready for broader organizational feedback, positioning us to begin concrete scoping of the Action Library and Workflows architecture. However, progress is blocked by the lack of a dedicated dev lead for Plays and continued delays in the Adverity LinkedIn migration, which now requires legal intervention to explore contract termination options. The team made significant progress on workbooks feature development despite resource constraints, while navigation research continues to show mixed results requiring deeper investigation into user adoption patterns.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Veronica Hudson delivered the comprehensive H2 one-pager for Plays using AI-assisted development tools, creating organizational alignment around the initiative\'s scope and sequencing. The document establishes clear workstreams for Action Library development and play orchestration, enabling the team to move from conceptual planning to concrete implementation roadmaps.

Mohan Sun completed critical analysis work including a voice-of-customer report for GTM plays that revealed strong enterprise interest in real-time signal integration with TAM analysis. His comprehensive incident report documenting Adverity\'s service failures provides leadership with the necessary context for strategic vendor decisions and potential contract termination.

Tanvi Vaidya successfully coordinated the workbooks-to-audiences release timeline despite team vacation schedules, making strategic scope reductions that maintain the July 15 customer release while ensuring core functionality remains intact. Her systematic approach to knowledge transfer and requirements prioritization kept the project on track during a critical development window.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Plays Initiative Development**: The H2 one-pager reached completion with stakeholder input integration, providing the foundation for detailed action library scoping and workflow architecture decisions. Veronica Hudson established clear workstream definitions and began design collaboration for board meeting presentations. Progress remains at 80% due to unresolved questions about workflow implementation approach and the critical need for dedicated engineering leadership on the initiative.

**LinkedIn Migration & Vendor Management**: Adverity validation work progressed to 80% completion with Mohan Sun creating comprehensive documentation of service failures and customer impact analysis. The vendor released partial fixes for audience ID mapping issues, but continued delays and communication challenges led to formal incident reporting and legal consultation for potential contract termination. Leadership discussions initiated around transferring project ownership to ads team for better resource alignment.

**Workbooks Feature Development**: Tanvi Vaidya achieved 90% completion of workbooks-to-audiences preparation through intensive knowledge transfer sessions and scope management. The team made strategic decisions to focus on core functionality for the July 15 release while deferring enhanced features, ensuring deliverable quality within constrained development timelines.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The absence of dedicated engineering resources for Plays creates a fundamental execution bottleneck that threatens H2 roadmap commitments. While the conceptual framework is solidifying, the inability to validate technical feasibility and begin implementation puts the initiative at risk of sliding timelines. Engineering leadership needs to prioritize resource allocation to match the strategic importance of this cross-functional initiative.

Adverity\'s continued inability to address critical LinkedIn integration issues represents both a technical and strategic vendor management failure. Despite escalated communications and executive involvement, their response times and service quality remain inadequate for our customer scale. The situation has evolved from a technical problem to a business continuity risk requiring immediate legal and procurement intervention.

Resource constraints across the workbooks development team highlight broader organizational challenges in balancing multiple high-priority initiatives. The compressed development timeline combined with team vacation schedules demonstrates the need for better resource planning and risk management when external commitments drive aggressive deadlines.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The voice-of-customer analysis for GTM plays revealed significantly higher enterprise interest than initially anticipated, particularly around integrating real-time signals with total addressable market analysis. This insight suggests we should prioritize enterprise-focused features in the action library development, as customers are specifically requesting ROI demonstration capabilities and high-value account prioritization workflows.

Adverity\'s service model fundamentally misaligns with our scale and urgency requirements, revealing gaps in our vendor evaluation and management frameworks. The discovery that they operate on a strict ticketing system addressing only one issue at a time, combined with their slow response cycles, indicates we need more rigorous performance criteria and escalation protocols for critical infrastructure vendors.

Navigation research continues to show mixed user adoption patterns, suggesting that the fundamental paradigm shift from horizontal to vertical navigation may create deeper user experience challenges than initially anticipated. The correlation between user tenure and adoption rates indicates we need more sophisticated rollout strategies that account for power user behavior patterns.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our collaboration with the GTM Studio team remains critical for Plays architecture decisions, particularly around whether to build new workflows or leverage existing infrastructure. Sneh and Marc\'s input on Monday\'s architecture meeting will determine fundamental design approaches and resource requirements for the remainder of H2.

The ads team integration for LinkedIn migration represents a strategic shift in ownership that requires careful knowledge transfer and coordination. Mohan Sun\'s domain expertise and documentation will be essential for ensuring continuity while the ads team assumes full responsibility for vendor management and technical execution.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on resolving the two major architectural decisions blocking Plays execution: securing dedicated engineering leadership and finalizing the workflow implementation approach. These decisions will unlock concrete action library development and enable the team to transition from planning to active development phases.

The Adverity situation requires immediate resolution through legal channels and vendor strategy discussions with leadership. Parallel development of contingency plans, including potential migration back to DeltaX, ensures we maintain LinkedIn integration capabilities regardless of contract termination outcomes.

Tanvi\'s continued workbooks integration work will benefit from clearer scope boundaries and stakeholder alignment as the team returns from vacation. The July 15 release timeline provides a critical test of our ability to deliver complex features under compressed schedules while maintaining quality standards.

# **Product Ops Executive Roundup - July 7-11**

## **Executive Summary**

July release materials are complete and going out today. Sam\'s VOC tool is stuck in deployment with a 16-person Slack thread - the company is not set up for internal innovation - will likely need escalation. Kristin finished planning one-pagers across all PM teams - everyone aligned on deliverables through August 1st. Critical issue: we spent 50% of our time tracking people down for basic tasks instead of building. Need to seriously reinvest our energy in improving the AI PMM system to eliminate this waste.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**July Release Delivered**: Brett and Ken got all materials out despite last-minute thrashing from stakeholders. Gage is sending the release today with only one implementation guide remaining. The process worked but exposed how much time gets wasted chasing people for uploads and document completion.

**Planning Process Complete**: Kristin delivered one-pagers from all PM teams except 3 who were on vacation. Teams now have a clear vision of deliverables and the critical path through August 1st. TPM will coordinate engineering readiness and the summary went to the channel highlighting key risks and dependencies.

**System Infrastructure Progress**: The team identified key improvements needed for PM document quality and VOC integration. Ken and Brett outlined next steps for streamlining the release process and reducing manual coordination overhead.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Release Management**: July materials are complete and going out today. Only remaining item is one implementation guide with Adam. Team learned that 50% of time was spent tracking people down rather than building - need to automate or eliminate this overhead.

**VOC Tool Deployment**: Sam navigated security review and got architect approval. Tool has GTM Studio filtering capability. Now stuck in 16-person Slack thread trying to get deployment sorted. Every person suggests talking to someone else - classic deployment hell.

**Planning Coordination**: All one-pagers completed and teams moved to step 3 (initiative definition and prototyping). Instructions sent out with August 1st Jira deadline. Kristin handling checkpoints and ensuring teams stay on track.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Deployment Infrastructure**: Company has no clear path for internal tools. Sam\'s been passed around to 16 different people with no clear decision maker. This will block every future internal tool. Someone needs to own this problem at the executive level.

**Communication Overload**: Planning updates, release coordination, and OP model changes all happening simultaneously. People getting overwhelmed with multiple channels and unclear priorities. Need immediate consolidation.

**Manual Process Overhead**: Release process revealed that half the time gets spent on administrative tasks - chasing uploads, tracking document completion, answering basic questions. Need to eliminate this waste.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Process Efficiency**: The release process showed that building tools is the fun part - nagging people to do basic tasks is what kills productivity. Team needs to focus on eliminating administrative overhead through automation or process redesign.

**System Integration**: Getting quality PM documents is critical for everything else to work. Current quality is C+ level. Next week\'s focus is improving document quality and integrating deep VOC data to supplement PM inputs.

**Infrastructure Reality**: Company infrastructure is designed for customer-facing products, not internal innovation. This systematic gap affects velocity and needs executive-level attention.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Support and knowledge center processes need complete overhaul. Current implementation guide and technical support approach doesn\'t scale. This requires broader organizational involvement beyond just the Product Ops team.

## **Looking Ahead**

With July release complete, the team is pivoting to significantly reinvest in the AI PMM system. Time to level up from execution mode to building sustainable infrastructure.

Ken and Daniel are focusing on dramatically improving PM document quality - the foundation that everything else depends on. Current C+ quality isn\'t good enough. Sam\'s deep VOC integration will supplement PM inputs once deployment is resolved. The goal is creating a system that produces consistently high-quality outputs without manual intervention.

Kristin is tackling the broader infrastructure challenge: streamlining the entire release process end-to-end and automating technical support. This isn\'t just process improvement - it\'s building the operating system for how Product Ops scales. The July release proved the concept works, now it\'s time to eliminate the remaining manual overhead and build something sustainable.

# **Semantic Data Team Executive Roundup - July 11, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The agentic platform achieved critical velocity this week with multiple production workstreams converging---API runs now trigger successfully with data fills largely operational, while Inga Isakov\'s cost analysis revealed that iterative batch processing extracts significantly more entities than full-thread processing at comparable cost. Two immediate priorities require executive attention: new tenant onboarding architecture decisions need rapid finalization as demand accelerates, and the Deep Web Research agent development by Josh Mantovani unlocks compound AI capabilities but requires architectural choices between existing frameworks versus custom implementation.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Danny Pan successfully triggered API runs with data fills now largely operational, marking our transition from manual to automated processing---though intermittent box crashes during populate_graph operations require debugging to achieve full reliability. The system now processes under 70K accounts with 3-month rolling data coverage approaching 50%, positioning us for scale testing next week.

Inga Isakov\'s comparative analysis of full-thread versus batch processing revealed a breakthrough: iterative daily batching extracts significantly more valid entities with minimal duplication while maintaining cost parity. This discovery fundamentally changes our approach to context extraction, with 10 additional examples queued for validation before locking the prompt structure by end of next week.

Josh Mantovani demonstrated structured LLM outputs within the agentic platform, eliminating dependency on the semantic data API while establishing foundation capabilities for all future agents. His basic search agent now handles compound queries with decomposition and multi-step web scraping, though depth limitations require the custom Deep Research implementation currently underway.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Data Pipeline Infrastructure**: Danny Pan achieved 90% completion on API automation, with data fills operational but experiencing stability issues during graph population phases that cause box restarts. The switch from manual account ID blocks to file-based processing remains pending for next week\'s testing, alongside production automation setup targeting regular updates.

**Cost-Optimized Entity Extraction**: Inga Isakov validated that batch processing by date delivers superior entity extraction compared to full-thread analysis at equivalent cost---a finding that challenges our original architectural assumptions. Initial samples show minimal duplication with significantly higher entity capture rates, particularly for entities mentioned before becoming active participants in threads.

**Agentic Platform Capabilities**: Josh Mantovani completed the basic search agent with query decomposition and web scraping, while structured output implementation unlocks quality improvements across all agents. The Deep Research agent extension requires custom implementation after existing frameworks (LangGraph, platform React agents) showed either instability or quality limitations incompatible with our requirements.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The new tenant onboarding process lacks critical documentation with Danny Pan confirming only two requirements identified: ZI tenant ID lookup and Passive Login Service integration. With Rowan Bailey flagging this as becoming \"high priority very quickly,\" the team needs immediate architectural decisions on whether to implement tenant-level permissions (currently unsupported) or rely on admin user impersonation with its inherent risks when personnel change.

Database connection limitations surfaced in development environment testing, with Danny encountering \"out of connections for non-replication users\" errors that block automated testing expansion. The sporadic nature (single occurrence) makes root cause analysis difficult, but resolution is critical before scaling to production loads.

Josh Mantovani\'s evaluation of existing agentic frameworks revealed fundamental limitations requiring custom implementation of the Deep Research agent---a decision that trades development velocity for quality and control. After testing LangGraph\'s React agent and internal platform options, each showed either \"bugginess and odd behavior\" or \"low quality results\" that couldn\'t be resolved within reasonable timeframes.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Inga Isakov\'s discovery that iterative batch processing outperforms full-thread analysis represents a paradigm shift in our entity extraction approach. By narrowing context windows while maintaining output token expectations, the system extracts more valid entities that full-thread processing misses---validated through manual review of additional entities as legitimate rather than noise.

The distinction between \"mentioned\" versus \"participant\" entities emerged as a critical insight during Inga\'s duplication analysis. When names appear in threads before those individuals join as participants, our current system creates apparent duplicates that actually represent different relationship states---suggesting we need entity type segmentation to capture this nuance for sales intelligence applications.

Josh Mantovani\'s framework evaluation journey validates our \"build versus buy\" decision framework: when multiple established solutions fail quality or stability requirements, custom implementation becomes the optimal path despite higher initial investment. His structured output breakthrough simultaneously demonstrates how foundational capabilities multiply value across all platform agents.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Integration with the broader agentic platform ecosystem accelerated this week with Josh Mantovani noting shared requirements for the Passive Login Service client across teams. While Danny Pan plans to copy rather than directly integrate code, this duplication pattern suggests opportunity for shared libraries as Rowan Bailey and Josh discussed---particularly as more teams need similar authentication capabilities.

The pending Inference Service fork remains unassigned despite its critical role in supporting structured outputs across the platform. Josh Mantovani\'s local implementation provides interim capability, but production deployment requires coordinated handoff to ensure his technique or equivalent functionality transfers to the centralized service without regression.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week pivots toward production hardening with Danny Pan transitioning from manual to file-based account processing while investigating the box crash patterns that currently require manual intervention---resolution unlocks true automation at scale.

Inga Isakov will analyze 10 additional examples to validate the batch processing advantage before finalizing prompt structures by week\'s end, with Rowan Bailey requesting detailed documentation via Confluence and demonstration recordings to cascade learnings across teams. This methodology lock enables production implementation planning.

Josh Mantovani continues Deep Research agent development with custom implementation path chosen, while scheduling knowledge transfer with web research teams to ensure we\'re not duplicating existing capabilities. His structured output patterns need documentation for platform-wide adoption as teams migrate from semantic data API dependencies.

# **Product DAI Executive Roundup - Monday July 7th - Friday July 11th**

## **Executive Summary**

The team is executing but constrained by foundational blockers. Query layer dependencies are paralyzing multiple critical workstreams including CRM enhancements, custom fields, and dataset development. Meanwhile, GTM Plays has \"too many cooks\" with 12 people in planning meetings but unclear ownership and timelines. AI Audiences finally has engineering resources assigned and development beginning, but we\'re still in requirements stage for most datasets rather than dev-ready work.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

AI Audiences breakthrough with engineering assignment. Jagan returned and development has officially begun on embedding chat into GTM Studio with ZI and GTM DM list building in progress. First demo expected by end of week - a significant acceleration from design-only work. Sneh\'s team consolidation across Brahm and Veronica\'s groups is creating clearer PM ownership across domains.

Identity resolution hitting all-time highs. Brandon\'s team achieved visitor resolution at all-time highs with core IP-to-company resolution up 11% via IP2Company 5x5 integration. Added over 12 million supplemental emails to the system. The team is executing on foundational improvements while planning next-generation capabilities.

Product Marketing engine delivering first full-scale monthly release. AJ\'s team successfully executed the July MCR with implementation guides, PR FAQs, and a new company-wide release communication strategy. This represents the first complete test of the new automated content generation system replacing traditional PMM processes.

### **Goals & Progress**

AI Audiences (Sneh): Development work officially started with assigned engineering team. Meeting aggressive timeline targets with first demo expected by end of week. Team consolidation creating clearer ownership with Tanvi on Workbooks core, Mohan on Activation via Workflows, and Corina on global datasets integration.

Pre-Copilot Experience (Vinay): Phase 1 now in testing with QA team running test plans. All pre-copilot work either in dev or ready for dev with no known blockers. Successfully managing transition from Alex to Ant on Profiles and Top Contacts with comprehensive handover documentation.

Context Engineering (Rowan): Taking over Bert\'s team while establishing vision for context engineering at ZI. Created 2-pager positioning document and RFC for agentic core team definitions. Planning work with Lars and Sean progressing well on milestone interdependencies between Copilot 2, Sales Hub, and Workbooks.

Identity Graph Optimization (Brandon): Form-complete vs resolution dashboard operational with qualitative and quantitative benchmarking in place. MAID-based identifier integration underway with exploratory work on MAID:HEM:IP optimization. Team identified significant enterprise opportunity for person resolution outside of signals.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Query layer dependencies creating cascade failures. CRM enhancements, custom fields, lookup fields, picklist values, and signals are all blocked by query layer issues. This is preventing multiple teams from moving beyond requirements into development. The dependency web is expanding - what started as individual feature blocks is now constraining entire workstreams across datasets, CRM integration, and core functionality.

GTM Plays execution hampered by organizational confusion. Ali reported 12 people showing up to planning meetings with \"too many cooks in the kitchen\" preventing decision-making. While high-level requirements are clear and no technical red flags exist, ownership clarity between Veronica (play use cases), Mark Frayle (workflows implementation), and Adam\'s team (natural language interface) remains undefined. Timeline commitments are vague.

Resource allocation decisions pending without clear planning process. Multiple team members flagged uncertainty about staffing against most important initiatives. ZIM vs. Plays vs. Data Agent resource allocation remains unclear. Agent platform specifically identified as understaffed. The team is waiting for \"planning\" but no structured planning motion exists, creating execution delays.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Human-in-the-loop requires platform-level architecture. Ali identified that current notification approaches hard-coded in Sales Hub or Copilot don\'t scale. The team needs a generic notification service similar to Slack\'s actionable notifications that can be leveraged across any product. This represents a fundamental platform requirement that impacts all agentic capabilities.

Enterprise demand for person resolution exceeds current product scope. Brandon discovered significant enterprise interest (Disney, Workday, insurance verticals) for person-based resolution through APIs or core Websites offering rather than just through Copilot. This suggests a much larger market opportunity than the current front-line seller focus allows.

Custom signals infrastructure has fundamental limitations. Vinay\'s investigation revealed custom signals only work for accounts/contacts with standard fields, not the custom fields most customers actually want to use. This requires global data model integration to support real customer use cases - a much larger technical lift than anticipated.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Query layer engineering continues to be the critical bottleneck for multiple product initiatives. The cascade effect from query dependencies is now impacting CRM enhancements, custom fields, dataset development, and core signals functionality. Without resolution, teams are stuck in requirements definition rather than development execution.

GTM Plays coordination between Veronica\'s team (use cases), Mark Frayle\'s team (workflows), and Adam\'s team (agentic platform) needs executive-level ownership clarity. Current multi-team approach is creating confusion rather than alignment.

## **Looking Ahead**

Query layer resolution is the single highest priority for unblocking multiple workstreams. Teams across AI Audiences, CRM integration, and custom signals cannot progress from requirements to development without this foundation. Executive intervention needed to prioritize engineering resources here.

GTM Plays requires immediate ownership and timeline clarity. The team has the technical capability and general alignment on direction, but needs executive decision-making on resource allocation and clear milestone commitments. The current \"too many cooks\" dynamic is preventing execution velocity.

Resource planning cannot wait for formal planning process. With Agent platform understaffed and unclear resource allocation between major initiatives, the team needs immediate clarity on staffing decisions to maintain momentum through H2 goals. Current execution is being constrained by organizational uncertainty rather than technical challenges.

# **Core Data Executive Roundup - Week of 07/07 - 07/11**

## **Executive Summary**

Magnus Herweyer joined as the new PM for shared services**.** Meanwhile, Jody Roberts achieved a breakthrough in AI agent development, successfully building a functional agent that calls person and company APIs within days, demonstrating the rapid prototyping potential of the new agentic platform. Cam Fortin faced a critical setback with the July 15th release requiring last-minute rollback of employee growth rate updates but was able to get the Company data updates and cube released prior to July 15th.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**AI Agent Platform Breakthrough**: Jody Roberts successfully built a working data insights agent that automatically connects to person and company APIs and answers thematic questions, proving the new agentic platform can enable rapid prototyping. The infrastructure automatically handles API connections and authentication, allowing focus on features rather than technical setup. This validates the strategy of dedicating team time to agent development as achievable weekly goals.

**Shared Services Strategic Vision**: Magnus Herweyer, despite starting just this week, developed a comprehensive vision for shared services that addresses the \"crimes against humanity\" data problem - enabling customers to submit terrible CRM data and receive normalized, enriched, validated output through a unified \"fix it\" service. This builds on his AWS experience where poor data quality required thousands of engineering hours to answer basic board questions.

**Mobile Data Infrastructure Completion**: Rituparna Das achieved 80% completion on mobile validation goals, successfully defining the mobile infusion checklist framework and securing data science resources starting Monday. With 8.5 million mobiles ready for processing and clarity achieved on MAT-to-HIM association requirements, the team is positioned to significantly expand mobile coverage next week.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Release Management Under Pressure**: Cam Fortin coordinated emergency response to a critical July 15th release issue requiring rollback of employee growth rate updates. Despite the late-breaking nature of this problem and his upcoming vacation, Cam successfully organized the necessary testing and coordination across API, offline enrichment, and cube teams to maintain the Tuesday release schedule.

**Data Sharing Infrastructure Advancement**: Heather Ma secured engineering alignment and received a concrete timeline estimate of 3 weeks for admin portal backend development from the integration team. The engineering team expressed confidence in the scope and requirements, though some internal team structure questions remain between DOS6 and DOS12 teams that could affect resource allocation.

**Strategic Roadmapping Acceleration**: John Durst progressed 50% toward completing roadmapping one-pagers while identifying critical data quality visibility gaps. His work revealed the need for consistent source-by-source accuracy metrics rather than high-level aggregates, potentially informing future analytics integration work. Additionally, data science teams requested prioritized project lists with specific focus on email generation and company industry classification.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Cross-Team Resource Bottlenecks Escalating**: Hayden Cowell\'s team reported significant delays from BI team resource constraints and timezone coordination challenges with Israeli engineering teams. Simple requests requiring 1-2 story points face month-long delays, while dependency tickets become ineffective when blockers emerge during investigation phases. This pattern is multiplying across multiple strategic initiatives, requiring executive intervention to establish clearer prioritization frameworks.

**Data Quality Measurement Infrastructure Gaps**: John Durst\'s analysis revealed fundamental blind spots in source-by-source data quality metrics, particularly around comparing accuracy between sources like Zippy and RV edits. The team operates with high-level quality indicators but lacks systematic, regularly updated comparisons that would inform data acquisition strategy and identify coverage gaps requiring attention.

**Release Coordination Complexity**: The July 15th release issue exposed coordination challenges when critical changes emerge late in the process. With Cam Fortin heading into vacation immediately after managing this crisis, the team faces questions about backup coverage and process resilience for future high-stakes releases requiring rapid cross-team coordination.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**AI Agent Development Velocity**: Jody Roberts\' successful agent development in just a few days demonstrates that the new agentic platform can enable meaningful weekly goals focused on customer-facing prototypes rather than infrastructure setup. The automatic API integration and authentication handling removes traditional technical barriers, suggesting the team should prioritize agent development as high-impact, achievable weekly objectives.

**Enterprise Data Quality Market Opportunity**: Magnus Herweyer\'s AWS experience reveals the massive scale of enterprise data quality problems, where companies invest thousands of engineering hours just to answer basic business questions due to poor CRM data standardization. His \"fix it\" service vision addresses a universal pain point that could differentiate ZoomInfo\'s go-to-market studio platform while improving internal data processing capabilities.

**Source-Level Quality Blindspots**: John Durst\'s investigation uncovered that the team lacks systematic quality comparisons between different data sources, operating instead with assumption-based hierarchies. This discovery suggests implementing regular source-by-source accuracy measurement could improve both data acquisition strategy and customer transparency about data provenance and confidence levels.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the BI team continues to create significant bottlenecks for contributory network monitoring and other strategic initiatives. Hayden Cowell\'s team faces month-long delays for simple requests due to resource constraints and unclear prioritization frameworks. The lack of product management oversight for the BI team exacerbates coordination challenges, requiring executive intervention to establish accountability mechanisms.

The integration team relationship around data sharing infrastructure shows positive momentum with Heather Ma securing dedicated engineering resources and clear timelines. However, internal team structure questions between DOS6 and DOS12 teams could affect resource allocation and require clarification from engineering leadership to maintain project momentum.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on capitalizing on the AI agent development breakthrough while addressing the resource coordination challenges that threaten multiple strategic initiatives.

Magnus will work with Jody and Brandon to refine the shared services vision during their Vancouver office visit, potentially establishing a transformative roadmap for enterprise data quality services. Rituparna Das will complete mobile infusion processing with newly secured data science resources, extending 5x5 data utilization beyond freemails. Peter Overman will finalize Form 5500 schema work and accelerate his CRM enhancement discovery, which Brandon identified as potentially game-changing for improving customer integration match rates. John Durst will complete roadmapping one-pagers while the team addresses data science team requests for prioritized project lists across email generation and company classification initiatives.

The successful AI agent development creates opportunity for rapid customer-facing prototypes that demonstrate data platform capabilities, while Magnus\'s shared services vision provides a compelling framework for next-generation go-to-market studio functionality that could obsolete enterprise data quality challenges.

Harinath has documented standardization recommendations for AJ Bellen and Preetam to accelerate future PM event creation processes. Cross-functional alignment achieved with engineering team approval of event architecture.

Advanced Search Infrastructure: Initial technical assessment complete, revealing larger-than-expected technical debt backlog. This week focuses on Jira grooming for search stories and epics, including go-to-market data model integration planning. Three-milestone approach defined with infrastructure, data integration, and UI overlay phases.

Topic Volume Boost Initiative: Staging environment successfully configured with additional shards, but indexing timeline extended significantly. Re-indexing 25% of production now requires 5 full days instead of anticipated timeline, pushing launch from this week to next week minimum.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Multi-AFS Strategic Direction: Harinath has completed framework documentation for multi-AFS initiative but cannot proceed without executive leadership decision on strategic direction. This blocker affects team planning and resource allocation for Q3 priorities, requiring immediate attention to maintain project momentum.

Co-pilot Demo Process Fragility: New demo process for intent structure bypasses traditional entitlements data, creating potential user experience gaps. Sales tenants may see limited or no intent data in co-pilot dashboard due to cluster-only display format, particularly problematic for customers with few intent topics (6-12). Design requires refinement with Team 28 to ensure demo effectiveness.

Entitlement Package Conflicts: Intent topic limits not properly honored when customers have multiple packages, with system defaulting to lower limits from prior packages rather than current entitlements. This technical issue is blocking co-pilot upsells and requires urgent resolution with design changes planned for next week review.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Analytics Event Creation Bottleneck: Working around analytics team bandwidth constraints revealed opportunity for PM self-service event creation. Harinath\'s documentation of standardization process with AJ Bellen and Preetam could significantly accelerate future product launches by reducing cross-team dependencies and enabling faster iteration cycles.

Technical Debt Impact on Advanced Search: Engineering assessment uncovered substantial technical debt affecting advanced search development timeline and complexity. Alex and Dennis\'s technical plan highlights need for infrastructure investment alongside feature development, suggesting resource allocation discussions for sustainable long-term progress.

Indexing Performance at Scale: Topic volume boost testing revealed indexing performance constraints not previously understood. Five-day re-indexing requirement for 25% of production data indicates need for infrastructure scaling strategy discussion as product grows, affecting future launch timing and capacity planning.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Team 28 on the new co-pilot demo design continues to be critical for sales demonstration effectiveness. Current design challenges around entitlements bypass and cluster display limitations require collaborative solution development to ensure sales tenant experience meets demonstration objectives.

The analytics team bandwidth constraints have created both challenge and opportunity, with Harinath developing workaround processes that could benefit broader product organization. Collaboration with AJ Bellen and Preetam on event creation standardization could establish new operating model for PM autonomy.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s primary focus centers on decision-making and technical execution, with multi-FS strategy direction as the highest priority for unblocking team progress.

Immediate Priorities: Executive decision on multi-FS direction to enable Harinath\'s team planning, continued Jira grooming for advanced search with Alex and Dennis to refine technical debt approach, and urgent resolution of entitlement package conflicts affecting co-pilot upsells. Advanced search one-pager will be socialized across stakeholders for milestone agreement and sequencing validation.

Technical Execution: Topic volume boost indexing will continue through 5-day cycle with launch targeting end of next week, co-pilot demo design refinement with Team 28 to address entitlements and cluster display challenges, and recommendation evaluation framework development for new topic recommendation features. The team maintains strong momentum toward August 15th intent recommendation launch with technical foundations solidly established.

# **Copilot Experience Team Executive Roundup - July 14, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Pre-Copilot Phase 1 is now in testing with all blockers resolved, marking critical progress toward September launch. However, marketing qualified accounts integration faces significant technical barriers requiring custom signals infrastructure overhaul. Team achieved 66% average goal completion this week, with strong momentum on Sales Hub launch and profiles handover, but customer marketing coordination challenges threaten rollout timeline.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Sales Hub Launch Success**: Ant Cuomo led the successful internal launch of Sales Hub, with users actively engaging and providing valuable feedback around filtering and grouping requirements. The launch revealed clear user preferences that will inform rapid iteration cycles for production readiness.

**Pre-Copilot Phase 1 Milestone**: Adam Severance and the development team eliminated all remaining blockers for Phase 1, with testing now underway. This represents a critical milestone toward the September production target, with additional phases also making substantial progress.

**Profiles Handover Progress**: Vinay Kamath has been transitioning profiles and top contacts ownership to Ant Cuomo, with Alex Tracy\'s comprehensive documentation facilitating the knowledge transfer. This handover is essential for maintaining momentum on the H2 sales hub integration goals.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Marketing Qualified Accounts Integration**: Vinay Kamath discovered that custom signals infrastructure has fundamental limitations, with workflows containing major bugs and lacking support for custom attributes. [[Document]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X9KkX2mjGa18iXPIiNnZVmwbD0uF1v1owCDAkNzC9QQ/edit?usp=sharing) has been created with recommendations on best path forward. The document will be updated with a V0 prototype.

**Onboarding Vision Development**: Adam Severance achieved 60% completion on onboarding prototypes, with strong alignment achieved with Sean on Sales Hub v2 integration. The current vision effectively serves users without explicit target accounts but requires expansion for smaller book-of-business use cases and CRM-connected scenarios.

**Copilot Launch Rollout**: Adam Severance encountered significant coordination challenges with customer marketing, achieving only 25% completion due to Mary\'s absence for security review cohort and John\'s concerns about percentage-based rollouts. Customer marketing systems operate on package-based campaigns rather than feature flags, creating operational complexity.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Custom Signals Infrastructure issue**: The marketing qualified accounts initiative revealed that custom signals fundamentally don\'t work due to workflow bugs and missing custom attribute support. This impacts not only the current pilot but potentially other custom signal use cases across the platform. Vinay Kamath has [[documented]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X9KkX2mjGa18iXPIiNnZVmwbD0uF1v1owCDAkNzC9QQ/edit?usp=sharing) recommendations, but this requires architectural attention and resource allocation.

**Customer Marketing Coordination Bottleneck**: The rollout strategy faces operational constraints where customer marketing cannot execute granular campaigns based on feature flags, only product packages. This misalignment between engineering deployment capabilities and marketing execution creates a significant coordination gap that could delay controlled rollouts.

**Resource Allocation During Transition**: With Vinay Kamath\'s departure on Friday and Victor starting Monday, the team must manage knowledge transfer while maintaining development velocity. Ant Cuomo needs dedicated time for deep dives on profiles work while continuing Sales Hub momentum.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Templates and Profiles System Misalignment**: Alex Tracy identified significant misalignment between desired profiles functionality and current design system capabilities. The templates space has too many unknowns with workspaces and plays integration, requiring a pivot to prototype-first development while dev team focuses on chat v2 integration.

**Mobile Research Insights**: Ant Cuomo\'s user interviews revealed valuable patterns around mobile account research usage, while the \"what\'s new\" toast replacement for signals is showing promising results through prompt service integration. This sets foundation for scaling similar use cases across the platform.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our coordination with customer marketing team through John continues to be essential for rollout success, but their package-based email capabilities create operational friction for feature flag-based deployments. The security review dependency with Mary requires immediate resolution to maintain rollout timeline commitments.

Revenue operations team collaboration on marketing qualified accounts pilot depends on resolving custom signals infrastructure issues before expanding beyond current limited scope.

## **Looking Ahead**

Primary focus for next week centers on finalizing Copilot launch rollout decisions by Wednesday and completing knowledge transfer activities before Friday transition. The team will drive toward September Sales Hub production readiness while resolving infrastructure challenges.

**Critical Path Items**: Adam Severance must resolve security review and customer marketing coordination issues immediately to maintain rollout timeline. Ant Cuomo and Vinay Kamath will conduct intensive handover sessions throughout the week to ensure seamless transition. The custom signals infrastructure recommendations require executive review and resource allocation decisions.

**Development Momentum**: With Phase 1 testing underway and strong engineering collaboration producing consistent results, the team is well-positioned to maintain development velocity across all phases. The focus on data model-first onboarding approaches and prototype-driven development will accelerate iteration cycles while managing technical debt effectively.
