# **Product Executive Intelligence Brief - June 30 - July 3, 2025**

*Synthesized from 14 team reports*

*For detailed questions about any item below, reference specific team reports or contact team leads directly.*

## **Executive Summary**

### **Update on Previous Week Blockers**

**Platform Infrastructure Resource Bottlenecks Creating Cascading Delays:** Progress made on Enterprise Search MVP (accelerated by 2 weeks) and UUID solution alignment, but design resource crisis at Apps team and staging pipeline issues at Intent team reveal ongoing infrastructure coordination challenges across multiple initiatives.

**AI Pricing Framework Decision Blocking October Launch:** Still unresolved with \"divergent opinions from leadership\" and critical July 11th deadline approaching. Brannen\'s team has conflicting guidance from Mark Harris and Adam Smith on value-based vs cost-plus-margin pricing that continues to block GTM Studio monetization.

**Critical Engineering Resource Allocation Gaps:** DAI team reports \"hemorrhaging execution velocity\" with same three blockers (pricing, workflows, H2 resourcing) paralyzed for 8+ weeks. Resource allocation decisions still missing despite explicit acknowledgment from leadership.

### **Current Week Update**

**Blockers:**

- **Decision theater blocking execution across multiple initiatives:** Three critical decisions (pricing mechanisms, workflows architecture, H2 resourcing) remain unresolved for 8+ weeks, creating cascading delays across Apps, Automation, User-Provisioning, and DAI teams.

- **Resource allocation gaps constraining strategic progress:** Design resource crisis at Apps team, engineering capacity constraints on Advanced Search, and analysis resource shortage across multiple teams preventing coordination on shared platform dependencies.

**Momentum areas:**

- **Data foundation breakthroughs driving customer value:** Core Data team\'s 26M freemail expansion, Data Platform team\'s Enterprise Search acceleration, and custom dataset success proving immediate revenue generation potential.

- **GTM intelligence capabilities reaching customer readiness:** Apps team\'s GTM Studio messaging breakthrough, Semantic Data team\'s multi-tenant support progress, and agent prototype development across multiple teams positioning for Q3 launch.

**Bottom line:** We have the technical execution capability to deliver on strategic transformation, but cross-team decision-making velocity must compress from quarterly to weekly cycles to match our operational momentum. The gap between team execution (90%+ completion rates) and strategic coordination (8+ weeks of decision paralysis) is becoming unsustainable.

### **Mission-Critical GTM Jobs (Customer-facing GTM intelligence capabilities)**

**Apps Team:** \"The Apps team is hitting critical velocity on GTM Studio launch but faces resource constraints that could derail Q3 deliverables. Two designers are out sick simultaneously, blocking UX research for Advanced Search and Engagement History features that support Microsoft retention and Copilot upsells. Meanwhile, engineering resources on Advanced Search are reduced due to the Israel conflict, creating a cascade of delays on accessibility requirements needed for Microsoft contract renewal in August. The team delivered strong progress on GTM Studio messaging and Gartner positioning, but feedback cycles with executives are creating timeline risk for the July 11 design handoff deadline. Without immediate intervention on design resources and stakeholder feedback velocity, we risk missing launch windows that directly impact revenue.\"

**Copilot Experience Team:** \"Critical pre-Copilot development work is 90% complete with launch timeline pushed 2 days due to S2A team API delays, now targeting Wednesday delivery instead of Monday. Adam Severance successfully coordinated cross-team deliverables while Alex Tracy achieved breakthrough results on profile UI through innovative rapid iteration with Carson, completing weeks of work in 2.5 days. Adam Severance identified strategic rollout opportunity with enterprise accounts in security review, creating pathway for early SalesOS adoption while clients await Copilot security clearance.\"

**ZIM Team:** \"H2 strategic planning is now complete with clear roadmap documentation defining goals across Ads, WebSights/FormComplete, and Intent for Q3 and Q4. Critical infrastructure improvements delivered this week, including resolution of 5x5 IP-to-company data ingestion (expected 2.7% lift in company identification) and LiveRamp contract execution providing 15-20% reach increase for advertising segments. Team achieved 100% goal completion rate despite shortened holiday week, with key foundations now in place for Q3 execution.\"

**Automation Team:** \"Engineering alignment challenges are slowing our extensibility handoff while GTM Plays requirements remain undefined. Sam Massie has completed product requirements and design for the form builder. Marc Frail was unable to secure time with Adam Smith or Sneh for GTM Plays alignment during the shortened holiday week. Adam Peretz delivered a successful PRFAQ through the new PMM Engine tool, setting up proper customer communications for the July API release.\"

**Plays, Campaigns, & Audiences Team:** \"The team successfully crossed the finish line on critical H2 planning deliverables and Gartner submissions while navigating significant operational challenges with vendor partnerships and customer escalations. Veronica Hudson completed comprehensive Plays workstream breakouts and secured leadership buy-in for H2 execution, while Tanvi Vaidya delivered all July 15 release preparation materials to ensure zero documentation blockers when the engineering team returns from vacation. However, Mohan Sun continues battling vendor reliability issues with major customer impact, including a Monday.com incident affecting a \$100K account, highlighting systemic risks in our LinkedIn migration approach that require immediate executive attention and potential strategic pivots.\"

**Intent/AFS/Advanced Search Team:** \"Team updated the 2H Roadmap for Intent, and it includes the M1, M2, M3 priorities we set out earlier in the year. Most urgent item remains the standard intent topic volume recovery which is stalled now due to error with account level intent processing on Staging. We hope to have that fixed on Monday and confirm the upgraded hardware has no negative impact on UI then commence testing on production. Critical Migration Decision Point: Harinath has completed prototyping for the legacy-to-account-level intent migration with three strategic options requiring leadership review. This migration will resolve customer complaints about inconsistent data between Advanced Search and Intent tabs while positioning us for improved signal quality. Meanwhile, Al is advancing the Advanced Search UI prototype through client iteration, though UXR research beginning next week which should provide crucial customer validation before final design work starts. This team faces ongoing disruption from complex intent issues requiring PM intervention, highlighting our need for stronger L3/L4 support to maintain development velocity.\"

### **Data Foundation & Consumption (Platform capabilities enabling GTM intelligence)**

**Data Platform Team:** \"Enterprise Search MVP delivery accelerated by 2 weeks through strategic architectural decoupling, while Unified Profile initiative gained critical internal customer validation that directly addresses SDR productivity challenges. The Search team successfully navigated complex cross-CRM integration dependencies and established clear workstreams with both Design and UI Engineering teams. However, ownership gaps remain for Advanced Search migration planning that could impact downstream adoption timelines.\"

**Core Data Team:** \"Rituparna Das led a major boost in contact coverage by completing infusion of 26 million additional freemails from 5x5 vendor data, which has so far resulted in 9.1 million new freemails available including 6.7 million attached to previously freemail-less contacts (Additional impact analysis is pending). This provides significant expansion of our contact reachability across all areas of our products including talent acquisition partners and improved WebSights visitor resolution. Additionally, Cam Fortin advanced company cube release preparation toward July 15th update. Hayden Cowell advanced email confidence model validation by completing testing between an existing regression model and data science\'s machine learning approach, with initial results favoring data science\'s approach for API implementation pending final team discussions. Heather Ma achieved completion on an AI agent prototype that successfully provides buyer engagement map agent on ZI agentic platform (tier 1 version) with basic relationship info and engagement data for single tenant. Which will ultimately drive the ability to showcase the value for customers who opt into Contributory Network contribution. However, Peter Overman\'s Form 5500 requirements analysis revealed that existing data storage doesn\'t meet customer use cases, requiring a ground-up rebuild that could impact Q3 delivery timelines.\"

**Data Team:** \"The Data team is executing well on tactical deliverables but faces critical infrastructure bottlenecks that will constrain Q4 revenue potential. While the Contractor Cube launches July 9th with strong GTM alignment, systematic resource constraints in analysis capacity and engineering prioritization are creating execution debt that threatens our ability to capitalize on the inbound lead acceleration opportunity---our biggest Q4 revenue driver. Immediate Action Required: Executive intervention needed on CN Admin Panel prioritization (Hannan\'s team) and analysis resource allocation to prevent Q4 delivery risk.\"

**Semantic Data Team:** \"The Semantic Data Team successfully addressed critical data quality issues while advancing key integration capabilities for the early access program. We uncovered and fixed a deep attribution bug that could have forced costly reruns at scale - catching this now saves significant future technical debt. Most importantly, we\'ve secured ownership for our evaluation framework through the agentic platform team, unblocking our ability to measure and improve retrieval quality. With early access customers already using GTM Studio, our immediate focus is enabling multi-tenant support and completing the workbooks integration to deliver the full semantic data experience.\"

**User-Provisioning Team:** \"This week, the User-Provisioning team made significant strides in defining the approach for Usage-Based Pricing and advanced crucial privacy features. A critical decision regarding the currency and pricing of AI features, with divergent opinions among leadership, needs final alignment by July 11th to avoid further delays. Additionally, the team successfully tested enhanced Data Privacy Controls, ensuring readiness for release and expanding support for customers.\"

### **Contextual Data Velocity (Learning flywheel creating competitive moat)**

**Core Data Team:** \"**Contributory Network AI Agent Prototype Development**: Heather Ma achieved completion on an AI agent prototype that uses a real-data CSV file to temporarily mock ZoomInfo data via custom data hooks, enabling realistic testing without direct query. The prototype demonstrates sales intelligence capabilities including organizational chart analysis, though development revealed significant challenges in data source integration across ZDP and BigQuery systems that will inform future platform development priorities. The goal here is to create a compelling proof point for Contributory Network acceleration strategy - showing customers the tangible benefits of deeper integration and network participation, while establishing a clear upgrade path from base product to single tenant CRM to co-op network intelligence.\"

### **Operational Velocity (Operating at AI-company speed vs SaaS speed)**

**DAI Team:** \"We are hemorrhaging execution velocity while drowning in alignment theater. Three critical decisions have been paralyzed for weeks: pricing mechanisms, workflows architecture, and H2 resourcing. Meanwhile, our September GA target requires immediate resource reallocation, yet teams are still running 10+ parallel initiatives hoping they\'ll magically converge in Q4. This is not a plan---it\'s wishful thinking wrapped in roadmap slides. Bottom line: We need three decisive actions this week or our October targets become fantasy. The alternative is another quarter of \'we\'re 90% there\' updates while revenue opportunities evaporate.\"

**Product Ops Team:** \"The team delivered significant progress on account targeting capabilities and July release preparation despite a shortened holiday week. Daniel Kong\'s automated account targeting approach received strong validation from sales leadership, with Alex confirming it was \'much better than what they would have come up with manually and much quicker.\' Meanwhile, Ken Elwell successfully completed v1 materials for the July release, while Sam Darcy advanced the VOC tool through critical security approval processes, setting up infrastructure frameworks for future internal tools.\"

**Business Intelligence Team:** \"Critical Integration Onboarding Initiative Shows Promise: Nanxi Ge and Farrell Tanuwidjaja have identified actionable hypotheses to accelerate slow integration onboarding for recent cohorts, with focus shifting to proving hypothesis #4 around onboarding model benchmarking. The team achieved 100% completion on key standardization efforts for monthly reporting (Phoebe Mei) and flywheel metrics validation (Eran Dayan), while AJ Belen secured methodology alignment for account health measurement despite stakeholder ownership challenges.

This represents a broader platform evolution from controlled internal data flows to supporting arbitrary external system integration, requiring new engineering patterns and validation approaches.

**PMM Engine tool delivers quality improvements at the cost of process complexity**, with Adam Peretz finding that while the new system requires hours of preparation and comprehensive documentation, it produces significantly better marketing materials. This suggests investment in process improvement is paying dividends but requires adjusted planning timelines.

**Partner schema definition emerges as future requirement**, with Sam Massie identifying that optional partner-defined schemas for API responses could enhance the extensibility platform. This capability would allow partners to specify data types and properties, making integrations more robust and user-friendly.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Workflow Apps engineering (Team 12) collaboration is essential for form builder completion, but their current architecture creates impediments to extensibility goals. The team needs support transitioning from their existing walled garden approach to handling diverse API data formats.

Adam Smith and Sneh availability is blocking GTM Plays requirements definition, with Marc Frail unable to secure necessary alignment time. This dependency becomes more critical as the September timeline approaches and planning windows narrow.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on overcoming engineering architecture challenges while advancing GTM Plays planning despite holiday scheduling constraints.

Sam Massie will begin H2 planning artifact development and map extensibility backlog, working around his Thursday-Friday PTO schedule. He will also coordinate with Lars on connector and workflow discoverability for the agentic platform, expanding the extensibility vision beyond traditional workflow scenarios.

Marc Frail will continue pursuing GTM Plays alignment with Adam Smith and Sneh despite being out Monday through Wednesday, recognizing that this work cannot be delayed further without impacting the September delivery timeline. Adam Peretz will return to API documentation finalization, leveraging the organizational work completed this week to deliver customer-ready materials.

The team faces a critical inflection point where engineering architecture decisions will determine the speed and scope of extensibility delivery, while GTM Plays requirements definition will shape the strategic direction of the entire automation platform.

Efforts are ongoing to determine whether to support LinkedIn OpenID Connect and Salesforce SAML as social login methods, aiming to enhance user experience and reduce support cases by transitioning customers away from credential-based logins.

### **Strategic Challenges**

A significant challenge remains the divergent opinions from leadership regarding the currency and pricing of AI features. Brannen Huske has identified this as a critical blocker, with differing views on whether to offer value-based pricing versus cost-plus-margin. A critical meeting on July 1st with Mark Harris and Adam Smith is set to align on this strategy, which is essential for the October release. Another critical issue is the P&P team\'s stance on charging margin on Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK) customers, which contradicts the desired approach. Brannen is working with Ali to ensure commitment to the previously made decision.

Jessie Lindstrom is facing a medium-impact blocker due to reliance on manual, downstream fixes for data inconsistencies rather than proactive, upstream sales process improvements\^18\^. This stems from a systemic lack of integrated upstream data governance, unclear ownership for source data integrity, and historical prioritization of sales process flexibility over preventing downstream data inconsistencies. This complex issue requires compromise across all stakeholders for sustainable change.

Josh Simon\'s team faces ongoing challenges with customer communications for login SSO adoption and 2FA removal\^21\^. While seeking to reduce poor login sentiment and increase SSO adoption, identifying the right customer communications team amidst recent restructures is a current hurdle.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

A key learning from Jessie Lindstrom\'s work is that while getting everyone in a room to solve a problem can feel efficient, taking upfront time with a smaller group to get clear, prioritized requirements keeps downstream teams focused on solving the problem effectively. This approach was successful in getting sign-off on product package reporting requirements.

Brannen Huske\'s team discovered that utilizing current bulk credits for usage-based pricing is not a viable option. While there\'s broad agreement on the overall approach for usage-based pricing, a final alignment is needed on whether the currency should be preloaded USD or a new AI credit.

Josh Simon\'s team learned that SCIM setup can be more chaotic than anticipated on the Okta side, highlighting the need to identify how to provide the best experience for SCIM users to boost adoption. They also observed that leveraging Workflows for Opt-out page integrations with CRM could be highly beneficial. Furthermore, their experience with Salesforce SAML revealed a critical security gap that led to its rollback, emphasizing the need for thorough security evaluations before implementing new login methods\^30\^.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Brannen Huske\'s progress on Usage-Based Pricing for GTM Studio is critically dependent on alignment from Packaging & Pricing, Product, PMM, and Leadership on the pricing model. The conflicting opinions from Mark Harris and Adam Smith require resolution.

Jessie Lindstrom\'s work on product package reporting relies on capacity for review from Product Operations, GTM Strategy, Data Engineering, and the Provisioning team. The qualitative understanding of customer behavior around credit management also requires access to credit utilization data across tenants\^34\^.

Josh Simon\'s efforts to expand the usefulness of privacy features (DAAC, CCIS) are dependent on integration with MOS, CRMs, and Workflows. Discussions with Marc Frail regarding workflows and reaching out to the ZIM team are necessary to address core questions about privacy feature compatibility\^36\^.

## **Looking Ahead**

The primary focus for Brannen\'s team next week will be to drive final alignment on the Usage-Based Pricing model for AI features by the July 11th deadline, incorporating customer survey results to inform the decision. This is crucial to unblock the GTM Studio monetization strategy.

Jessie Lindstrom will be reviewing the prioritized product package reporting requirements with engineering and documenting the technical needs and owners for each workstream\^3838\^. This will translate the stakeholder alignment into actionable engineering tasks to improve reporting accuracy and consistency\^39393939\^.

Josh Simon\'s team will prioritize H2 planning and provide feedback on the RealNPS report v2. This includes re-validating calls based on the new labeling to ensure accurate identification of login issues\^40404040\^. Additionally, syncing with the communications teams for SSO adoption and conversion will be a key focus to improve the customer experience and reduce support cases\^41\^. The team also plans to continue investigating the feasibility and security implications of supporting LinkedIn OpenID Connect and Salesforce SAML as login methods.

The team is confident that by focusing on these key priorities and actively resolving the identified blockers, they will continue to deliver significant value and enable strategic initiatives like GTM Studio monetization and enhanced privacy capabilities.

# **Business Intelligence Team Executive Roundup - July 3, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**Critical Integration Onboarding Initiative Shows Promise**: Nanxi Ge and Farrell Tanuwidjaja have identified actionable hypotheses to accelerate slow integration onboarding for recent cohorts, with focus shifting to proving hypothesis #4 around onboarding model benchmarking. The team achieved 100% completion on key standardization efforts for monthly reporting (Phoebe Mei) and flywheel metrics validation (Eran Dayan), while AJ Belen secured methodology alignment for account health measurement despite stakeholder ownership challenges. Next week requires executive attention on finalizing account health scoring methodology before ELT presentation.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Integration Onboarding Investigation Breakthrough**: Farrell Tanuwidjaja completed comprehensive interviews with Account Managers and Customer Success Managers, generating validated hypotheses about integration delays. The team successfully narrowed focus to hypothesis #4, which will establish onboarding model benchmarks and create early warning systems for accounts falling outside acceptable timeframes, directly addressing the core business challenge of slow recent cohort integration.

**Automated Reporting Infrastructure Complete**: Phoebe Mei successfully standardized and automated the monthly North Star metrics reporting, including both average and median converting actions per user per month, plus Chat AI usage metrics. This eliminates manual reporting overhead and ensures consistent leadership visibility into key performance indicators, with final approval pending from leadership by end of week.

**AI Adoption Analysis Reveals Strategic Insights**: Inbal Kor\'s analysis of AI usage within workbooks shows 30% of users who created workbook sheets have used at least one AI column, with 42% of all sheets now including AI columns. Sales and Operations teams lead adoption at 49% usage rate, with AI columns representing 5% of all columns across ZoomInfo, CSV, and CRM sources, providing clear direction for product development priorities.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Integration Onboarding Optimization**: Farrell Tanuwidjaja achieved 100% completion on stakeholder interviews and hypothesis generation, successfully identifying the most promising avenue for improvement. Current focus on hypothesis #4 will establish benchmark timelines for different onboarding models and create automated alerting for at-risk accounts, with validation expected by end of week.

**CI Marketing Renewal Intelligence**: Nanxi Ge completed 60% of planned customer interviews despite holiday week challenges, successfully identifying target renewal accounts and generating standardized questioning framework. Initial responses confirm model accuracy in identifying interested prospects, with structural and leadership challenges being primary purchase barriers rather than product fit issues.

**Reporting Standardization Initiative**: Phoebe Mei achieved 100% completion on monthly report automation and board meeting data standardization, successfully implementing North Star metrics tracking and updating Good Set definitions based on revised factor criteria. Leadership approval on final definitions expected by end of week, enabling full automation rollout.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Account Health Methodology Ownership Clarity**: AJ Belen identified a critical process learning around stakeholder ownership of methodology definitions. While alignment on post-onboarding health measurement approach was achieved, the extended timeline revealed that VP-level stakeholders should drive initial proposals rather than the BI team seeding definitions, which created misaligned expectations about shared ownership when clear executive ownership was needed.

**Cross-Functional Integration Dependencies**: The integration onboarding investigation revealed gaps between Account Manager capabilities and technical integration requirements. Nanxi Ge\'s renewal conversations highlighted that many interested prospects face structural barriers (marketing team organization, leadership transitions) that require cross-functional coordination beyond traditional sales approaches.

**Resource Allocation During Holiday Periods**: Multiple team members experienced reduced productivity during the holiday week, with Nanxi Ge noting significant communication delays and Farrell requiring additional support from other team members. This highlights the need for better holiday period planning and resource reallocation strategies.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**AI Adoption Patterns Reveal Product Development Opportunities**: Inbal Kor\'s analysis revealed that while AI column adoption is strong (30% of workbook creators), usage patterns vary significantly by team function. Sales and Operations teams show 49% adoption rates, while overall AI columns represent only 5% of total columns, suggesting significant growth potential. The primary use case centers on account quality evaluation, fit assessment, and churn risk analysis, indicating clear product enhancement opportunities.

**Integration Onboarding Model Effectiveness Varies**: Farrell Tanuwidjaja\'s investigation revealed that different onboarding models have significantly different success rates and timelines. The research identified that bugs and technical difficulties in connecting integrations represent actionable improvement areas, while import adoption rates vary across onboarding model cohorts, suggesting optimization opportunities through better model matching.

**Renewal Conversation Quality Drives Outcomes**: Nanxi Ge discovered that providing context when requesting information leads to more detailed responses and meaningful conversations. The gap between Account Managers and Product team expertise emerged as a key insight, with pairing AMs with product experts during renewal conversations potentially strengthening narrative and increasing likelihood of renewal or upsell success.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Integration team on onboarding optimization continues to be critical for addressing the slow adoption challenge affecting recent cohorts. Farrell Tanuwidjaja\'s hypothesis validation requires close collaboration with Product Management to implement technical solutions for identified integration connection issues, while the benchmark establishment needs Operations team support for alert system implementation.

The CI Marketing renewal initiative requires coordination between Sales, Customer Success, and Product teams to address the structural barriers identified in prospect conversations. Nanxi Ge\'s findings about AM-Product team knowledge gaps suggest need for enhanced collaboration protocols and potentially embedded product expertise in renewal conversations.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on validation and implementation of key insights generated this week, with particular emphasis on proving the integration onboarding hypothesis and establishing automated systems for future monitoring.

**Integration Onboarding Hypothesis Validation**: Farrell Tanuwidjaja will complete testing of hypothesis #4, establishing benchmark timelines for each onboarding model and creating risk assessment framework for accounts falling outside acceptable ranges. Success depends on data availability and stakeholder alignment on benchmark definitions. **CI Marketing Dashboard Development**: Nanxi Ge shifts focus to creating automated dashboard wireframes for long-term renewal intelligence, working with Veronica and CI Marketing stakeholders to define sustainable data sources and update frequencies. **Account Health Methodology Finalization**: AJ Belen will complete account health scoring methodology validation by running test accounts through the new framework before ELT presentation, ensuring methodology robustness and stakeholder confidence.

The team maintains strong momentum across all initiatives, with clear paths to value delivery in the coming week. The combination of completed standardization efforts, validated hypotheses, and strategic insights positions the team to drive significant business impact through both immediate tactical improvements and longer-term systematic enhancements.

# **Core Data Executive Roundup - Week of 06/30 - 07/03**

## **Executive Summary**

**Rituparna Das led a major boost in contact coverage by completing infusion of 26 million additional freemails from 5x5 vendor data, which has so far resulted in 9.1 million new freemails available including 6.7 million attached to previously freemail-less contacts (Additional impact analysis is pending).** This provides significant expansion of our contact reachability across all areas of our products including talent acquisition partners and improved WebSights visitor resolution. Additionally, Cam Fortin advanced company cube release preparation toward July 15th update. Hayden Cowell advanced email confidence model validation by completing testing between an existing regression model and data science\'s machine learning approach, with initial results favoring data science\'s approach for API implementation pending final team discussions. Heather Ma achieved completion on an AI agent prototype (demo [[\[link\]{.underline}]{.underline}](https://zoominfo.zoom.us/clips/share/hBp_C30pSp26aaVN4ZfgYA)) that successfully provides buyer engagement map agent on ZI agentic platform (tier 1 version) with basic relationship info and engagement data for single tenant. Which will ultimately drive the ability to showcase the value for customers who opt into Contributory Network contribution. However, Peter Overman\'s Form 5500 requirements analysis revealed that existing data storage doesn\'t meet customer use cases, requiring a ground-up rebuild that could impact Q3 delivery timelines.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Freemail Coverage Expansion**: Rituparna Das completed processing of 26 million remaining freemails from 5x5 vendor data, achieving 9.1 million new freemail additions including 6.7 million attached to previously freemail-less contacts. The team also initiated mobile phone pre-validation processes with comprehensive checklists developed for accurate mobile validation. This expansion improves coverage for talent acquisition partners and website visitor resolution use cases.

**Company Cube Release Preparation Advances**: Cam Fortin made substantial progress toward July company cube release readiness, targeting final metrics completion by Wednesday and coordinating API testing for master company API and offline enrichment service. The release timeline creates urgency with Monday sign-off requirements, particularly given Cam\'s planned time off the following week. This progress keeps the quarterly release schedule on track despite complexity in validation processes.

**Email Confidence Model Testing Advanced**: Hayden Cowell completed the critical bake-off between email confidence models, testing both an existing regression model and data science\'s machine learning approach on 100,000 email samples with real deliverability data. Both models performed well with confidence scores aligning closely to actual deliverability, though data science\'s machine learning approach showed stronger negative skew for identifying high-quality emails. The team is leaning toward the machine learning model for API implementation but requires additional team discussions to finalize the decision.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Proactive Privacy Compliance Initiative**: John Durst initiated critical EU ReachOut data purging to proactively address privacy compliance following competitor legal action. The team is systematically removing contact information sourced from EU ReachOut accounts while preserving legally usable public data from other sources. This proactive approach protects against potential litigation while maintaining coverage from legitimate data sources, demonstrating forward-thinking risk management.

**Contributory Network AI Agent Prototype Development**: Heather Ma achieved completion on an AI agent prototype that uses a real-data CSV file to temporarily mock ZoomInfo data via custom data hooks, enabling realistic testing without direct query. The prototype demonstrates sales intelligence capabilities including organizational chart analysis, though development revealed significant challenges in data source integration across ZDP and BigQuery systems that will inform future platform development priorities. The goal here is to create a compelling proof point for Contributory Network acceleration strategy - showing customers the tangible benefits of deeper integration and network participation, while establishing a clear upgrade path from base product to single tenant CRM to co-op network intelligence.

**Customer-Specific Data Analysis**: John Durst completed analysis work with key customers ServiceNow and Verizon, revealing better-than-expected coverage in specific market segments. However, this work highlighted the critical need for automated customer-specific data performance processes rather than one-off analysis efforts, as the current approach doesn\'t scale practically across the customer base.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Form 5500 Data Architecture Requires Rebuild**: Peter Overman\'s requirements analysis revealed that years of analysis team data collection and storage doesn\'t align with actual customer use cases, forcing a complete rebuild of data transformation logic. The dataset contains 15 different sponsor fields and multiple address configurations depending on US vs international filings, requiring sophisticated logic development. While Peter has identified all necessary requirements, the ground-up rebuild approach could impact Q3 delivery timelines.

**Data Platform Integration Complexity**: Heather Ma\'s AI agent development exposed significant challenges in data source comprehension across ZDP and BigQuery systems. The distributed nature of data sources creates integration complexity, with the most challenging aspect being understanding data relationships rather than AI model implementation. This discovery highlights the need for clear best-practice guidance around data architecture \-\-- including when to build APIs, when to migrate or duplicate data into the ZoomInfo Data Platform (ZDP), and whether AI systems should query external sources like BigQuery directly.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Vendor Data Integration Impact**: Rituparna Das\'s successful processing of 26 million freemails demonstrates the value of systematic vendor data integration. The achievement of 9.1 million new freemails, with 6.7 million filling previously empty contact records, shows how strategic vendor partnerships can improve data coverage and customer value.

**Privacy Compliance Best Practices**: John Durst\'s proactive approach to EU ReachOut data purging demonstrates the importance of staying ahead of regulatory risks in the data industry. The systematic removal of specific data sources while preserving legitimate coverage shows how compliance can be achieved without sacrificing data quality when properly executed.

**Machine Learning Model Advantages**: The email confidence model comparison revealed that while both regression and ML approaches perform well, the machine learning model\'s pattern recognition capabilities make it more effective for emails with limited validation data. This insight suggests prioritizing ML approaches for confidence scoring across other data types where traditional rule-based systems may be insufficient.

**Customer Data Performance Patterns**: John Durst\'s analysis with ServiceNow and Verizon revealed that large enterprise customers often focus on highly specific geographic or industry segments that don\'t align with overall account patterns. This discovery reinforces the need for automated customer-centric data performance dashboards rather than resource-intensive one-off analyses.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the analysis team on Form 5500 data requires immediate coordination given the discovery that existing data storage doesn\'t meet customer use cases. Peter Overman needs sustained analysis team focus to rebuild requirements from scratch, competing with other initiatives for limited bandwidth and requiring clear prioritization from leadership.

The AI agent development work reveals the need for stronger collaboration with Data Platform teams to address data source integration challenges. Heather Ma\'s prototype progress demonstrates potential but requires architectural improvements to scale effectively across the organization.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on finalizing this week\'s advanced initiatives while addressing the Form 5500 data architecture challenges that could impact Q3 deliverables.

Rituparna Das will work with analysis to finalize comprehensive coverage numbers for release notes and pricing considerations while completing mobile validation processes to extend 5x5 data utility beyond freemails. Cam Fortin will complete final company cube metrics and coordinate Monday sign-off processes before planned time off. Hayden Cowell will continue analysis of the two confidence models and finalize which one advances to API implementation, working with the person team on integration planning. Peter Overman will accelerate Form 5500 requirements completion despite the ground-up rebuild, coordinating closely with the data acquisition team for draft review and potentially escalating to leadership for resource prioritization decisions. Heather Ma will continue AI agent development while documenting data platform integration challenges for future architecture planning.

The successful freemail expansion creates opportunity for similar systematic vendor data integration across other contact attributes, while the email confidence model advancement provides a roadmap for expanding ML-powered confidence scoring across additional data types.

# **Product DAI Executive Report - Week of June 30th**

## **Executive Summary**

**We are hemorrhaging execution velocity while drowning in alignment theater.** Three critical decisions have been paralyzed for weeks: pricing mechanisms, workflows architecture, and H2 resourcing. Meanwhile, our September GA target requires immediate resource reallocation, yet teams are still running 10+ parallel initiatives hoping they\'ll magically converge in Q4. This is not a plan\-\--it\'s wishful thinking wrapped in roadmap slides.

**Bottom line:** We need three decisive actions this week or our October targets become fantasy. The alternative is another quarter of \"we\'re 90% there\" updates while revenue opportunities evaporate.

## **Critical Execution Gaps**

### **Decision Paralysis is Killing Momentum**

The same three blockers have appeared in every weekly update for **8+ weeks**:

- **Pricing mechanisms**: Adam reports \"mostly aligned in principle\"\
  \
  \
  but no decision document exists. Mark Harris meetings continue weekly with no closure.

- **Workflows vs. rebuild**: Engineering teams in Israel are \"nervous\
  \
  \
  about layoffs\" while we debate whether to refactor 10% or 90% of existing workflows. This existential uncertainty is paralyzing the team.

- **H2 resourcing**: Dominik explicitly states \"Don\'t have clarity\
  \
  \
  on whether we have the right people behind the most important initiatives\" yet no planning motion exists.

**Reality check:** These aren\'t technical problems\-\--they\'re leadership bottlenecks. Each delay cascades through dependent teams, creating the illusion of progress while actual shipping dates slip.

### **The \"Waterfall to October\" Trap**

Our current approach has **500+ parallel initiatives** all targeting October GA. This is textbook waterfall disguised as agile planning. Dominik correctly identified this risk: \"Let\'s not waterfall this thing out until October.\"

**The math doesn\'t work:** Teams are building AI audience building, plays architecture, data management, agentic platforms, and contributory networks simultaneously. When everything is priority one, nothing is priority one.

## **Strategic Misalignment**

### **Product-Market Fit vs. Feature Factory**

Multiple teams report being \"90% there\" on capabilities while admitting fundamental gaps:

- **Sneh warns about activation desert**: \"We\'re gonna end up\
  \
  \
  with\...a data set that they need to go download into a CSV.\" This is the classic innovator\'s dilemma\-\--building elegant demos that don\'t solve real workflow problems.

- **Brandon\'s agent work hits infrastructure reality**: \"Need to\
  \
  \
  streamline sources into Agentic Platform\-\--unreasonable to run through GTM DM/Event Bus.\" Technical debt is constraining our most promising initiatives.

### **The Contributory Network Honesty Gap**

Darrell\'s blind spot reveals institutional delusion: \"No one\-\--literally no one\-\--talks about CN beyond \'we have emails from CE\' in sales calls.\" We\'re banking strategic bets on capabilities that sales won\'t even mention to prospects.

**This isn\'t a messaging problem\-\--it\'s a value delivery problem.** If our own sales team won\'t lead with CN, why are we building our competitive moat around it?

## **Immediate Action Required**

### **1. End Decision Theater (This Week)**

**Pricing**: Adam and Mark Harris must produce a single-page decision document by Thursday. No more \"mostly aligned in principle.\" Either we have implementable pricing mechanisms or we don\'t.

**Workflows**: Ali must review the workflows decision document and provide a binary recommendation: refactor or rebuild. The Israel team\'s uncertainty ends Friday.

**H2 Planning**: Dominik must publish resource allocation decisions by end of week. \"There is no planning motion\" is unacceptable when teams are waiting for direction.

### **2. Implement Vertical Slice Execution**

**September Target**: Ship AI audience building as standalone value, not as part of October\'s \"everything integrates\" fantasy.

**Resource Reallocation**: Move 2-3 engineers from lower-priority initiatives to agent platform work immediately. Brandon\'s infrastructure constraints are choking our highest-value capabilities.

**Kill Parallel Development**: Each team lead must identify their #1 milestone for September and pause everything else. We\'re not resourced for parallel execution across 10+ initiatives.

### **3. Force Truth-Telling on Customer Value**

**CN Reality Check**: Brandon and Heather must produce concrete value propositions for contributory network by Tuesday. If we can\'t articulate why customers should care, we stop building until we can.

**Activation Gap**: Sneh must define the minimum viable activation path for AI audience building. \"Download CSV\" is not a product\-\--it\'s a demo.

## **Organizational Accountability**

### **Leadership Overhead is Crushing Execution**

AJ identifies a critical process problem: \"The ZI way of having meetings\...is for leaders to add everyone from their team.\" This creates 8-person meetings where real decisions can\'t be made.

**Solution**: Implement \"disagree and commit\" decision-making. Leaders make decisions in 2-3 person meetings, then broadcast outcomes. No more consensus-building meetings disguised as strategy sessions.

### **Change Management is Eating Engineering Cycles**

Sneh reports \"fair amount of change management shifting PM focus.\" This is resource waste when we\'re already behind on core deliverables.

**Solution**: Freeze all non-essential PM transitions until September milestones are achieved. Organizational restructuring during crunch time is self-sabotage.

## **The Path Forward**

### **Week 1 (July 8-12): Decision Week**

- Pricing decision document signed off

- Workflows architecture decision finalized

- H2 resource allocation published

- September vertical slice scope locked

### **Week 2 (July 15-19): Execution Reset**

- Engineering resources reallocated to agent platform

- Non-essential parallel initiatives paused

- CN value proposition validated or killed

- AI audience building demo ready for customer validation

### **Week 3 (July 22-26): Delivery Proof Points**

- First customer using AI audience building end-to-end

- Agent platform infrastructure unblocked

- October GA scope realistic and achievable

## **Final Reality Check**

**We are not 90% there.** We are 90% planned, which is meaningless without execution. Every week we delay these decisions, our October timeline becomes more fantasy and less reality.

The choice is binary: make hard decisions now and ship valuable capabilities in September, or continue alignment theater until we\'re explaining another delayed launch to the board.

**The clock is ticking. The market won\'t wait for our perfect plan.**

# **Data Platform Team Executive Roundup - 6/30/25**

## **Executive Summary**

**Enterprise Search MVP delivery accelerated by 2 weeks through strategic architectural decoupling**, while Unified Profile initiative gained critical internal customer validation that directly addresses SDR productivity challenges. The Search team successfully navigated complex cross-CRM integration dependencies and established clear workstreams with both Design and UI Engineering teams. However, ownership gaps remain for Advanced Search migration planning that could impact downstream adoption timelines.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Unified Profile - Internal Customer Validation Unlocked Strategic Direction**: Adwait Kirtikar secured alignment with internal operations teams who manage account unification workflows, discovering their current processes directly mirror Unified Profile objectives. **This validation came at perfect timing as Henry\'s recent SDR survey identified duplicate contact tracking as a top productivity killer, creating a compelling internal use case for the initiative.**

**Unified Profile - Cross-Functional Engineering Alignment Secured**: Both Design (Meghan C) and UI Engineering (Nebo) teams committed dedicated bandwidth to support Unified Profile survivorship logic configuration and UI integration deliverables. This coordination eliminates potential downstream bottlenecks and enables proper milestone scoping for technical implementation.

**Enterprise Search - Architectural Dependencies Resolved with Clear Delivery Path**: Menna Rashwan obtained critical UUID solution alignment with the Integration team, enabling reliable cross-CRM entity joins for Enterprise Search. The team completed joint planning sessions with Workbooks, establishing clear integration pathways for the Import CRM → Find Contacts → Enrich journey, positioning the platform for rapid downstream adoption once APIs are ready.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Enterprise Search & Integration Architecture**: Menna Rashwan successfully aligned with Integration team on the UUID solution approach and confirmed delivery timeline, enabling reliable cross-CRM entity joins for Enterprise Search. Linda Johannessen facilitated architectural alignment across Query API and federated search layers, establishing system boundaries critical for Workbooks integration planning.

**Unified Profile Customer Discovery**: Adwait Kirtikar completed initial customer validation with internal operations teams, confirming core product-market fit assumptions. The operations team shared existing account unification workflows that directly translate to Unified Profile requirements, providing concrete user stories for Milestone 1 development. Design team engagement secured, with deep-dive sessions scheduled to translate operational workflows into technical specifications.

**Third-Party Data Integration Framework**: Marc Delurgio documented end-to-end process for rapid third-party dataset onboarding, creating systematic approaches for both enrichment and search use cases. The framework addresses workbooks revenue opportunities while establishing foundation for future DaaS and PaaS capabilities, with clear coordination paths across Data Platform, Data, and Apps teams.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Advanced Search Migration Ownership Gap**: The Workbooks → Import Advanced Search journey requires UX design, integration, and migration execution, but ownership remains unclear between Apps, Workbooks, and Search teams. While the Import CRM journey has clear integration pathways, this gap risks delaying comprehensive downstream adoption and could create user experience inconsistencies across search interfaces.

**Cross-CRM Entity Resolution Complexity**: Despite UUID solution alignment, the temporary implementation approach introduces architectural debt that requires Q4 refactoring once Metadata Registry and CDC are delivered. This creates dual implementation paths that could impact resource allocation and introduces potential data consistency challenges during the transition period.

**Agent-First Architecture Timing Pressure**: Linda Johannessen\'s research indicates agent consumption timelines are accelerating faster than current planning assumes. The team needs to balance immediate API delivery requirements with longer-term architectural decisions that support intelligent activation capabilities, potentially requiring strategic prioritization shifts.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Internal Operations as Product Validation Engine**: The alignment with internal operations teams revealed that ZoomInfo\'s own account unification challenges directly mirror external customer pain points. This creates a powerful validation framework where internal process improvements become demonstrable customer value propositions, potentially accelerating both internal adoption and external market positioning.

**Cross-Team Resource Commitment Requires Early Coordination**: Securing Design and UI Engineering bandwidth commitment early in the process eliminated downstream bottlenecks and enabled more accurate timeline estimation. This demonstrates the value of front-loading cross-functional alignment conversations, particularly for initiatives requiring specialized expertise outside core team capabilities.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with **UI Engineering (Nebo)** and **Design (Meghan C)** teams on Unified Profile survivorship logic configuration requires sustained bandwidth allocation through Milestone 1 completion. Current commitments are secured, but ongoing coordination will be critical as technical specifications emerge from operational workflow analysis.

**Integration team** coordination on UUID solution delivery directly impacts Enterprise Search MVP timelines. While current alignment exists, the 2-week delivery timeline adjustment requires careful monitoring to prevent cascading milestone delays. The temporary UUID implementation provides mitigation but introduces architectural complexity requiring Q4 resolution.

## **Looking Ahead**

**Next week focuses on converting strategic alignment into executable technical specifications** while maintaining momentum across parallel workstreams. The team will leverage strong foundational work to accelerate customer validation and architectural implementation.

**Unified Profile initiative** moves from validation to requirements definition, with deep-dive sessions scheduled between operations, design, and engineering teams to translate workflow insights into technical specifications. Success depends on maintaining operational team engagement while developing scalable technical approaches.

**Enterprise Search** advances integration planning with Workbooks team, focusing on resolving Advanced Search migration ownership while preparing for UUID solution delivery.

**Third-party data integration** framework moves from documentation to stakeholder alignment, with reviews scheduled across Data Platform, Data, and Apps teams to confirm implementation approaches and resource requirements.

**The convergence of customer validation, architectural alignment, and cross-functional commitment positions the team for accelerated execution**, with clear pathways to demonstrate customer value while building platform capabilities that support long-term strategic objectives.

# **Data Team Executive Roundup - Monday June 30 - Thursday July 3**

## **Executive Summary**

**The Data team is executing well on tactical deliverables but faces critical infrastructure bottlenecks that will constrain Q4 revenue potential.** While the Contractor Cube launches July 9th with strong GTM alignment, systematic resource constraints in analysis capacity and engineering prioritization are creating execution debt that threatens our ability to capitalize on the inbound lead acceleration opportunity\-\--our biggest Q4 revenue driver.

**Immediate Action Required:** Executive intervention needed on CN Admin Panel prioritization (Hannan\'s team) and analysis resource allocation to prevent Q4 delivery risk.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Contractor Cube Go-Live Secured:** Dow Jones delivered all GTM enablement materials, targeting, and sales collateral for July 9th launch. Sales has everything needed to begin outbound motion on this highly-requested SKU that should drive meaningful near-term revenue. The team demonstrated strong cross-functional execution despite end-of-quarter timing constraints.

**Buyer Engagement Maps Breakthrough:** Brandon Tucker\'s team achieved a significant technical milestone by successfully building agents that can produce comprehensive buyer engagement maps on-demand, including organizational hierarchy data never before accessible. This directly addresses high-value co-op use cases and demonstrates our ability to leverage AI for data resolution\-\--a critical capability for scaling operations.

**Person-Based News Signal Optimization:** Steve Hutchinson completed funnel analysis revealing that 83% of raw signals are lost in topic assignment automation, but those making it through have an 85% acceptance rate. This represents a massive opportunity to increase signal throughput with process adjustments rather than additional resources.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Agent Development (50% Complete):** Two AI agents in development\-\--Data Correction Agent and Buyer Engagement Map\-\--showing promise for automating resolution bottlenecks. Current limitation is scaling beyond local machine processing, requiring infrastructure investment to achieve production readiness.

**2H Planning PRDs (60% Complete):** Bert Lui made partial progress on Copilot v2 and GTM Studio Account Prioritization PRDs, with initial reviews scheduled. Progress constrained by key stakeholder availability during planning week.

**Customer-Facing Materials (95% Complete):** Ethan Young nearly completed customer-facing deck for company definition, identifying significant opportunity to clean up over/under-combined companies using new techniques before full definition implementation.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Analysis Resource Crisis:** Multiple team members (Ethan Young, Jody Roberts) reporting critically low analysis capacity due to competing priorities and team members on leave. This is constraining progress on high-impact initiatives including company definition work and 5x5 data utilization\-\--both critical for Q4 product offerings.

**CN Admin Panel Engineering Bottleneck:** Brandon Tucker flagged \"Critical\" blocker with CN Admin Panel updates. Root cause analysis reveals complex backend ownership issues and lack of clear prioritization, despite Hannan\'s team being identified as best engineering owner. This directly impacts contributory network capabilities.

**Company Source Creation Frozen:** Dana Hurtig reports company pipeline freeze creating uncertainty around adding new companies, with knowledge transfer held up pending resolution. This impacts our ability to maintain data freshness and completeness.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**AI Agent Value Chain Clarification:** The team discovered that identifying data issues is straightforward, but automated resolution is the true bottleneck. This insight is reshaping agent development strategy from detection-focused to resolution-focused approaches, potentially delivering higher ROI with fewer resources.

**GTM Operations Velocity Gap:** Dow Jones identified that sales and marketing operations are significantly slower than product development cycles. The team is building automation and self-service capabilities to reduce external dependencies\-\--a pattern that should be replicated across other GTM touchpoints.

**5x5 Data Utilization Scope:** Jody Roberts\' analysis revealed teams are risk-averse toward new data source additions, requiring low-risk implementation strategies while exploring mid/long-term improvements in parallel. This has implications for how we introduce other high-value data sources.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

**Engineering Prioritization Alignment:** Multiple critical initiatives (CN Admin Panel, company definition technical requirements, VRS optimization) require engineering resources that lack clear prioritization frameworks. The team needs product leadership to establish clear priority hierarchies to prevent resource contention.

**GTM Studio Integration Timeline:** The inbound lead acceleration workflow depends on visitor resolution service improvements and GTM Studio platform readiness. Current VRS has potential to scale from 180 to 1,600+ person matches from anonymous visits, but requires quality testing infrastructure before Q4 launch.

## **Looking Ahead**

**Q4 Revenue Opportunity Crystallizing:** The team is aligned on inbound lead acceleration as the primary Q4 revenue driver, with visitor-to-lead workflows offering compelling demo value. Early testing shows potential to increase person identification from website visits by 8x, directly supporting GTM Studio platform fees and custom data set sales.

**Resource Constraint Resolution Required:** Next week\'s success depends on resolving analysis capacity constraints and securing engineering prioritization for CN Admin Panel work. Without intervention, tactical execution will continue but strategic initiatives will remain stalled.

**Copilot Renewal Tailwinds:** Early indicators show Copilot renewals trending positive compared to historical SalesOS rates, providing confidence in Q4 renewal cycle performance. This creates favorable conditions for expanding GTM Studio adoption among existing customers.

The team has strong technical execution capabilities and clear strategic direction, but requires immediate executive support to remove systemic bottlenecks that could constrain Q4 revenue potential.

# **Intent, AFS & Advanced Search Team Executive Roundup - July 3, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Team updated the 2H Roadmap for Intent, and it includes the M1, M2, M3 priorities we set out earlier in the year. Most urgent item remains the standard intent topic volume recovery which is stalled now due to error with account level intent processing on Staging. We hope to have that fixed on Monday and confirm the upgraded hardware has no negative impact on UI then commence testing on production.

Critical Migration Decision Point: Harinath has completed prototyping for the legacy-to-account-level intent migration with three strategic options requiring leadership review. This migration will resolve customer complaints about inconsistent data between Advanced Search and Intent tabs while positioning us for improved signal quality.

Meanwhile, Al is advancing the Advanced Search UI prototype through client iteration, though UXR research beginning next week which should provide crucial customer validation before final design work starts.

This team faces ongoing disruption from complex intent issues requiring PM intervention, highlighting our need for stronger L3/L4 support to maintain development velocity.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Intent Migration Strategy Completed**: Harinath delivered comprehensive prototyping for migrating legacy intent to account-level intent, including complete migration, toggle options, and hybrid approaches. This strategic work addresses customer complaints about data inconsistencies and positions us to deliver more refined, impactful signals with reduced noise across all platform experiences.

**Advanced Search UI Evolution**: Al successfully updated his Cline install to the latest Angular version and completed A/B testing between design tools, revealing important insights about design quality and functionality gaps in these design tools. This technical foundation enables continued iteration while we await crucial UXR research feedback starting next week.

**Phase 2 Recommendations Ready for Development**: Harinath completed final specifications and boundary conditions for the data science team\'s Phase 2 recommendations system. The grooming session today will provide development timelines for the semantic document analysis feature that automatically generates recommendations from uploaded transcripts, audio files, and marketing briefs.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Legacy Intent Migration**: Our goal here is to fix the user experience which currently support 2 different types of intent calculations and results. This causes much confusion and support calls. We\'re exploring upgrading the old intent tab to account level intent so it\'s more in-line with our new profile view, which is account level intent based.Harinath has validated all migration options with engineering and completed design prototyping for three approaches: complete migration, toggle between old/new experiences, and hybrid retention of both signal-level and account-level data. Final engineering estimates and timeline discussions are pending to move toward implementation decision.

**Intent Recommendation Enablement**: The goal of this project is to help our clients select and assign the best possible intent topics, by providing discovery based on guided intent linkage to opportunity objects, and helping clients discover topics they may have otherwise missed and generated leads from. Working with the marketing engine to prepare enablement materials for marketing-wise customer launch, with subsequent rollout to copilot customers. Harinath is refining the prompting system to eliminate assumptions and noise in PR/FAQ document generation, targeting completion by July 4th despite US holiday.

**Advanced Search Client Development**: Goal is to create UX visions for natural language based advanced search and consider how we may integrate facets or traditional approaches with that. Al has been prototyping wth our new ai based prototyping tools. Al encountered significant differences between V0 and Claude design capabilities, requiring extensive prompting refinement and directed visual and functional quality improvements. The process on Cline has much longer wait times than on v0. Al felt v0 \"just gets us\" as designers, but Cline struggles to surprise and delight. Will continue these prototype developments once we learn more from the UXR research.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Operational Disruption from Intent Issues**: Al is managing three complex intent issues from the CDM team that require extensive PM investigation and technical resource allocation. These recurring disruptions are significantly impacting development velocity, with each issue consuming many hours of assessment and resource coordination despite ongoing L3/L4 ramp-up efforts. The issues range from entitlement issues for Copilot trials to volume complaints. These issues have materially impacted our ability to work on advanced search. Shuxin is working on various diagnostics tools, but these are all delayed now due to the re-orgs and impacts on data science and analytics teams.

**Staging Pipeline Breakdown Blocking Production**: The account level intent processing pipeline broke on staging during volume update testing with new shards and Solr shards, preventing progression onto production testing. Al designed a comprehensive A/B test for this upgraded that confirms we have only expected impacts on the UX and volume in the sales and marketing UI. The issue was found due to a test case in this test design. This critical blocker has delayed the volume update deployment that customers urgently need and forced data science team disruption, creating 3-4 day delays on recommendation product development. And given the lack of resources on data science, this issue is causing about a week delay in our other roadmap project for topic recommendations.

**Multi-AFS Roadmap Decision Dependency**: Harinath has completed stakeholder research with marketing, product, and sales teams and documented three recommended options for multi-AFS direction. Leadership review and decision on the documented recommendations is required to proceed with this strategic initiative. This review was requested because it\'s been asked that we deprioritize further work with AFS, but this multi-AFS feature has been promised to customers on the ZIM public facing roadmap for over a year, hence there are likely many ZIM customers expecting it.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Design Tool Capability Gap**: While working towards developing concepts for natural language search, Al\'s A/B testing between Cline and V0 revealed significant quality and functionality differences between V0 and Cline for UI design work. Cline requires more extensive prompting, waiting, and produces lower initial quality outputs, and processes more slowly, indicating need for adjusted expectations and workflow modifications for future design iteration cycles.

**Account-Level Intent Value Validation**: Harinath\'s analysis confirms that account-level intent provides more meaningful insights with fewer but more impactful signals compared to legacy data sources. The customer complaints about inconsistent results between platform areas validate the strategic importance of uniform migration across all touchpoints.

**Recommendation System Scope Clarity**: To move along our topic recommendation roadmap item, we\'re working through Phase 2 specifications with data science and this revealed the comprehensive nature of semantic document analysis across multiple file types. The system\'s ability to process transcripts, audio, CSV, and marketing briefs into actionable recommendations represents significant competitive advantage potential once deployed.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our staging pipeline recovery requires immediate data science team support, creating competing priorities with recommendation product development timelines. The multi-AFS roadmap progression depends on leadership review and strategic decision-making on the three documented options Harinath prepared.

Advanced Search UI designs will incorporate upcoming UXR research findings, requiring design team collaboration to translate customer feedback into refined prototypes. Engineering estimates for intent migration options are pending to inform final implementation strategy decisions.

Looking ahead to H2, we have key dependencies on Clickagy team for 2 prioirty roadmap items this year, custom topic acceleration and persona based intent. We\'re concerned that the re-org is going to make achieving these 2 goals challenging in 2025. But we\'ll revisit once the current list of intent issues are handled.

## **Looking Ahead**

**Week of July 7th Focus**: Work with Data science on resolving the staging pipeline issue to unblock production volume testing and commence testing the volume increase on productoin asap. Work with design and uxr to design the advanced search UXR research questions and internalize the insights for the next generation of Advanced Search. Review Hari\'s multi-afs deprecation implication document with leadership

**Critical Path Items**: The staging pipeline recovery must complete immediately to resume volume update testing that customers are demanding. Leadership review of multi-AFS options will determine strategic direction for this key initiative.

**Strategic Opportunity**: Successfully resolving the technical blockers while advancing customer-validated UX for intent and advanced search to deliver both immediate value through volume updates and long-term competitive advantage through enhanced user experience. The combination of refined intent data and improved interface design creates compound value for customer retention and competitive positioning.

# **Semantic Data Team Executive Roundup - June 30th - July 3rd 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The Semantic Data Team successfully addressed critical data quality issues while advancing key integration capabilities for the early access program. We uncovered and fixed a deep attribution bug that could have forced costly reruns at scale - catching this now saves significant future technical debt. Most importantly, we\'ve secured ownership for our evaluation framework through the agentic platform team, unblocking our ability to measure and improve retrieval quality. With early access customers already using GTM Studio, our immediate focus is enabling multi-tenant support and completing the workbooks integration to deliver the full semantic data experience.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Data Quality Breakthrough**: Jon Seller identified and fixed a critical bug in meeting/person attribution that was causing data variance issues. This proactive discovery prevents what could have been catastrophic at scale - imagine having to rerun thousands of engagements across multiple tenants. Jon\'s implementing comprehensive integration tests to ensure this class of bugs never resurfaces.

**Enhanced Entity Extraction**: Inga Isakov\'s evaluation of iterative email processing revealed we can capture 10-15% more entities compared to processing entire threads at once. This finding directly improves the richness of insights we can provide to sales teams, ensuring we don\'t miss critical pain points or requirements mentioned across long email threads.

**Evaluation Framework Secured**: Rowan Bailey successfully transitioned ownership of the evaluation framework to Christian Pecora and the agentic platform team. This critical handoff means we\'re no longer flying blind on retrieval quality - Christian already has concrete ideas for building a zero-to-one evaluation framework for our query decomposition and re-ranking capabilities.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Entity Generation Testing** (Inga Isakov): Successfully evaluated 3 email thread samples comparing iterative vs. full-thread processing. Initial results show 10-15% improvement in entity capture with iterative approach. Currently at 60% complete with prompt refinements underway to prevent duplicate entities and improve extraction quality.

**Search Agent Development** (Josh Mantovani): Built initial shallow search service for the agentic platform using Brave API. Core functionality complete but deployment blocked by procurement delays for API key. Pivoted to exploring agent reasoning strategies that will be critical for deep research capabilities. 70% complete pending API access.

**Production Data Pipeline** (Jon Seller): Fixed critical attribution bug and implementing integration tests to prevent recurrence. Ready to process high-ACV account list (100k+ accounts) once testing completes. Multi-tenant support implementation queued for next week. 40% complete with significant progress on quality assurance.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Multi-Tenant Architecture Gap**: Josh Mantovani identified that our current internal tenant ID system won\'t work for external consumers. Before we can scale to multiple early access customers, we need to implement support for Zoom Info tenant IDs. This blocks our ability to serve workbooks and other consumers who won\'t have access to our internal ID mapping.

**ZDP Integration Missing**: We\'ve been processing data in GCP, but workbooks needs it in ZDP (Zoom Data Platform). Josh highlighted that even with automated pipeline triggers, we haven\'t built the connection to transfer processed data where consumers need it. This creates a manual bottleneck that will become unsustainable as we scale.

**Web Scraping Integration Delays**: Josh needs to leverage the web scraping team\'s infrastructure for the search agent but hasn\'t received responses from Andrew Harris. Given the massive scale of their existing service, partnering with them could accelerate our deep research capabilities significantly. Rowan will escalate to unblock this cross-team collaboration.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Iterative Processing Superiority**: Inga\'s discovery that processing emails iteratively captures 10-15% more entities fundamentally changes our ingestion strategy. This isn\'t just about quantity - these additional entities often represent nuanced pain points or requirements that emerge through conversation flow, exactly the insights sales teams need most.

**Early Bug Detection Saves Exponential Cost**: Jon\'s proactive bug hunting revealed an attribution issue that would have multiplied in impact with scale. At 10 tenants with thousands of engagements each, a full data rerun would be technically and financially prohibitive. This validates our strategy of being \"nimble while we can\" before scaling.

**Unified Evaluation Strategy Emerging**: The handoff to the agentic platform team isn\'t just solving an ownership problem - it\'s creating a unified approach to evaluating all agent capabilities. Christian\'s vision for evaluating tool selection, query decomposition, and retrieval quality will benefit the entire platform, not just semantic data.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our collaboration with the **Workbooks team** on API integration remains critical but visibility is limited. We need confirmation on whether they\'ll call our API in batch mode and their timeline for integration. Without this coordination, early access customers won\'t experience the full value of semantic data in their AI attributes.

The **Web Scraping team** has built infrastructure operating at \"insane\" scale that could dramatically accelerate our search agent capabilities. Despite their stated willingness to support (\"tell us what you need\"), we\'re blocked on basic communication. Their existing deep crawl capabilities could give us a significant competitive advantage if we can establish the partnership.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s singular focus is unblocking multi-tenant support to serve early access customers effectively. Jon will complete testing on high-ACV accounts and implement Zoom Info tenant ID support, while Josh builds the critical ZDP data transfer pipeline.

Inga will finalize the email processing evaluation and establish gold standard benchmarks for our 10-15% improvement target. We\'ll also solidify the workbooks integration plan with direct outreach to Tushar to confirm batch processing requirements and timeline.

Most strategically, Rowan will frame our \"context engineering\" vision - how we transform raw data into high-quality context for agent consumption. This positioning will guide H2 planning and ensure we\'re building not just a data service, but the semantic intelligence layer that powers the entire GTM platform.
