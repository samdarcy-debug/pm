# **Core Data Executive Roundup - Week of 07/14 - 07/18**

## **Executive Summary**

Peter Overman secured dedicated GTM Studio ownership through Corina and
delivered two additional implementation guides while advancing CRM
enhancement discovery from Contributory Network Milestone 5 efforts that
potentially are high-impact for improving customer integration match
rates. Meanwhile, Magnus Herweyer achieved stakeholder alignment on
shared services vision across product leadership, positioning the team
to advance enterprise data quality solutions, while Hayden Cowell has an
agreed upon plan for Polaris metrics implementation in Q3.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Strategic Planning Acceleration**: Jody Roberts completed proof of
concept for the data insights agent and secured Brandon\'s support for
an agent platform hackathon, while Magnus Herweyer achieved full
stakeholder alignment on shared services vision from Michael, Hasmik,
Casey, and Brandon. The team is now positioned to advance both
AI-powered customer experiences and enterprise data quality solutions
simultaneously, with clear executive backing for both initiatives.

**GTM Data Store Implementation Breakthrough**: Peter Overman delivered
two additional implementation guides and secured critical ownership
clarity when Sneh explicitly assigned Data PM teams to own use cases
prioritization for customer-facing requirements. This resolves months of
unclear accountability and positions the team to build the right
functionality based on deep data expertise rather than generic product
assumptions.

**Data Quality Infrastructure Advancement**: Hayden Cowell secured final
approval for Polaris metrics implementation in Q3, with research
resources allocated and engineering alignment confirmed. By the end of
Q3, the team will deliver comprehensive data health metrics including
company accuracy, person accuracy, coverage, and depth for both
entities - addressing long-standing visibility gaps across the
organization.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Location Data Standardization to Incorporate Social Location:**
Rituparna Das achieved consensus from PTI engineering, Hasmik, and
Brandon on address standardization around metro areas.

**Person Data Processing Adaptations** while adapting mobile infusion
strategy due to Neustar API processing limitations (2 million records
per 3 days). The team prioritized 1.9M manager+ mobile records first and
secured agreement to unfreeze 76% of C-level contacts frozen during
earlier company cleanup initiative, maintaining momentum despite
technical constraints.

**Release Management Success with Visibility Gaps**: Cam Fortin
successfully delivered the company quarterly cube with no major issues,
demonstrating execution capability under pressure. However, the process
revealed critical blind spots in customer delivery visibility from the
product side, with deliveries spanning snowflake tables and FTP CSV
files without systematic tracking - a gap Cam plans to address in the
on-demand cube initiative.

**Source Alignment Framework Development**: John Durst completed the RV
edit versus Zippy alignment plan, with only final feedback from Hasmik
and Brandon remaining. His ServiceNow customer interaction revealed that
even multi-billion dollar organizations still struggle with buying
committee definitions and remain unaware of ZoomInfo capabilities like
Co-Pilot and signals, suggesting internal education opportunities.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Customer Data Access Complexity**: Rituparna Das discovered that data
improvements don\'t automatically become available to all customers,
with supplemental emails requiring elite plus and advanced plus SKUs as
add-on features. This revelation suggests systematic review is needed to
understand which data enhancements require contract modifications versus
automatic availability, potentially impacting customer value realization
timelines.

**Processing Infrastructure Constraints**: The new star API\'s
processing limitations (2 million records in 3 days for 8.5 million
total mobile records) forced strategic prioritization of manager+ mobile
records first, extending overall completion timelines. This constraint
pattern could affect other high-volume data processing initiatives and
requires architectural consideration for future vendor integrations.

**Cross-Team Coordination Complexity**: Peter Overman\'s CRM enhancement
discovery requires navigating sensitivity around web data acquisition
team expectations while securing official data set owner approval for
specific recommendations. The coordination challenge extends to ensuring
Kristen has proper logic specifications for data ingestion, highlighting
the need for clearer handoff processes.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Enterprise Customer Data Sophistication Gap**: John Durst\'s
ServiceNow interaction revealed that even multi-billion dollar ZoomInfo
customers with established relationships lack awareness of core platform
capabilities like Co-Pilot and signals. Additionally, these
organizations continue actively developing their buying committee
profiles, suggesting opportunities for consultative engagement rather
than assuming enterprise customers have fully defined use cases.

**Agent Platform Development Velocity**: Jody Roberts\' successful proof
of concept development demonstrates that the agent platform
infrastructure enables rapid prototyping focused on outcomes rather than
technical implementation. With semantic search, RAG functionality, and
API connections handled automatically, the team can concentrate on
customer value creation rather than technical architecture.

**Data Quality Service Market Validation**: Magnus Herweyer\'s
successful stakeholder alignment on shared services vision validates the
significant enterprise market opportunity for comprehensive data quality
solutions. His AWS experience showing thousands of engineering hours
required for basic business questions provides concrete evidence of the
pain point ZoomInfo can solve at scale.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the PII team on agent platform authentication represents a
critical next step for converting proof of concept capabilities into
customer-facing solutions. Jody Roberts\' successful demonstration
creates urgency around resolving technical integration challenges to
maintain development momentum while the team explores hackathon
opportunities.

The web data acquisition team coordination requires careful navigation
as Peter Overman advances CRM enhancement initiatives that have been in
development for months. Clear communication about recommendations and
official approval processes will be essential to maintain team
relationships while accelerating customer value delivery.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on converting strategic breakthroughs into executable
commitments while addressing the technical and coordination challenges
that could impede Q3 delivery momentum.

Jody Roberts will finalize Q3/Q4 commitment lists to 90-95% completion,
establishing clear execution roadmaps for the remainder of the year
while coordinating PII team involvement in agent platform
authentication. Magnus Herweyer will advance from stakeholder alignment
to resource acquisition, navigating the challenge of securing
engineering resources for the new shared services team. Peter Overman
will complete web data acquisition roadmap planning through his
scheduled session with Serena and Andrew while pursuing official
approval for CRM enhancement recommendations. Rituparna Das will
complete manager+ mobile infusion processing and advance address
standardization implementation, while Cam Fortin will address customer
delivery visibility gaps and complete LRT ticket requirements. Hayden
Cowell will leverage his Q3 Polaris approval to begin implementation
planning with secured research resources.

The convergence of agent platform capabilities, shared services vision
alignment, and GTM Studio ownership clarity creates opportunity for
transformative customer experiences, while systematic data quality
measurement and mobile coverage expansion strengthen the foundation for
enterprise data management leadership.
