# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of October 20, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

AI Page Rank early access launched successfully Tuesday with Matt Barnes
working with CX recruiting 5-6 beta customers while workbooks agent
scalability issues require urgent resolution before November 3rd GA
deadline. Brett Elliot transitions to workbooks infrastructure team
deploying scalable agent architecture by October 31st as team navigates
resource reallocation cutting Inferno to 2.5 engineers and Clickagy to
6-7 engineers. Partner audience match rate optimization opportunities
identified ranging 20-90% requiring firmographic enhancement beyond name
and domain matching.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Matt Barnes launched AI Page Rank early access and beta program Tuesday
with Katie\'s CSM team recruiting 5-6 additional enterprise and
mid-market customers beyond two current small customer testers. Q4
planning reaches 80% completion with all epics for Aadhitthyaa, Shuxin,
and Matt\'s teams targeting end-of-day Friday delivery pending capacity
estimate finalization through Ganesh and Venkata coordination.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal advanced identity data partner onboarding
coordination across five teams with Privado order form completion
scheduled for next week maintaining November 18th GA timeline. GTM
Config offerings generation succeeded for SurveyMonkey, SupportLogic,
and Cvent while Berlin Packaging site crawling failure reveals technical
limitations requiring investigation for production readiness.

Shuxin Yang completed retroactive intent delivery exceeding minimal
requirements while advancing persona intent signal development with data
science team ticketing for Q4 execution. Intent agent table
clarification with Amy supports ALI data consumption while intent usage
complexity determination defers offerings integration to future
versions.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Agent Infrastructure**: Brett Elliot assumes workbooks agent
scalability responsibility requiring deployment of production-ready
container orchestration by October 31st for November 3rd workbooks GA.
Current architecture spawns individual containers per cell causing
Kubernetes health check failures and resource exhaustion requiring
fundamental infrastructure redesign with Ryan, Grant, Sean, Richard, Cy,
and Mehdi coordination.

**Partnership Development**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal identified partner
audience match rate variance from 20% to 90% based on company name and
domain matching revealing optimization opportunities through
firmographic enhancement including revenue and location data. Path
Factory insights documentation review questions value proposition
overlap with existing WebSights capabilities requiring strategic
rationale clarification.

**Platform Integration**: Shuxin Yang progressed ALI data GTM Store
ingestion coordination with Linda while completing retroactive intent
outage stabilization before sales team messaging deployment. Vendor
20-signal limitation requires intent aggregation strategy development
determining signal definition scope and standard topic utilization
approach.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Anwar Mai manages resource reallocation reducing Inferno to 2.5
engineers and Clickagy to 6-7 engineers requiring cutline establishment
across 42 projects for executive presentation. The capacity constraints
necessitate difficult prioritization decisions balancing agent
infrastructure, GTM Config, DMP development, international expansion,
and Connected TV against available engineering bandwidth.

Brett Elliot faces compressed timeline deploying scalable workbooks
agent infrastructure by October 31st addressing container orchestration
failures where Python agents don\'t respond to Kubernetes health checks
causing pod destruction and recreation cycles. The architectural
redesign requires three separate components coordinating successfully
preventing November 3rd workbooks GA failure.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal addresses domain data gaps affecting 7-8% of
evaluated companies (45,000 of 620,000) preventing offerings generation
requiring empty state UI development for customer-provided information.
ZoomInfo company ID appending process clarity remains needed from Anne
Fajkus and Matthew Williams for tenant onboarding workflow validation.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Matt Barnes learned from OO workflow management that connected agents
approach provides tremendous data processing flexibility requiring
consideration in future signal pipeline architectural decisions. The
team recommends additional knowledge transfer sessions with OO team
informing design patterns for workflow orchestration capabilities.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal discovered partner audience match rate
optimization potential through firmographic data enhancement beyond
current name and domain matching. The 20-90% variance suggests
significant improvement opportunities supporting Adobe partnership value
delivery while enabling more accurate audience creation for buying group
completeness workflows.

Anwar Mai\'s coordination with Sneh and Marc Frail established website
journey data January 2026 delivery timeline enabling resource
reallocation while maintaining stakeholder commitment clarity. The
contract development for WebSights and FormComplete data availability
requires definition specifications including session duration
constraints for workflow trigger integration.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Katie\'s CSM team advances AI Page Rank beta recruitment
targeting enterprise and mid-market customers for comprehensive testing
beyond current small customer base. Matt Barnes coordinates early access
program expansion through Tuesday CX team presentation demonstrating
capabilities and recruitment support.

Partnership coordination with Privado advances order form completion for
identity partner scanning capabilities at \$50K annual investment
enabling November 11th manual scanning launch. Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal
manages five-team coordination maintaining November 18th production
timeline through meticulous dependency planning.

Agent infrastructure requires urgent Brett Elliot coordination with
Ryan, Grant, Sean, Richard, Cy, and Mehdi deploying scalable container
orchestration preventing workbooks November 3rd GA failure. The
compressed timeline demands focused execution addressing Kubernetes pod
lifecycle management and resource contention issues.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week emphasizes resource cutline presentation and November release
preparation while Brett addresses workbooks infrastructure scalability
before GA deadline.

Anwar Mai presents resource allocation plan to Carlos demonstrating
cutline impacts across 42 projects with reduced engineering capacity
requiring executive prioritization decisions on agent infrastructure,
GTM Config, international expansion, and Connected TV initiatives. Jesse
Miller advances DeltaX campaign management path development while
progressing DoubleO audience activation workflow integration and VRS
is_bot flag person-level logic enhancement.

Matt Barnes completes website visitor journey signal PRD expansion while
advancing FormComplete and visitor journey attribute mappings for data
store integration. AI Page Rank early access monitoring continues with
beta customer feedback collection informing production readiness
assessment. Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal progresses partner audience
integration while advancing account AI toward November 14th target and
coordinating November release end-to-end testing across custom
reporting, conversion tracking, and identity partner onboarding.

Brett Elliot deploys scalable workbooks agent infrastructure by October
31st coordinating three-component solution enabling November 3rd GA
while managing LiveIntent and 5x5 extended analysis for vendor
continuation decisions. Shuxin Yang advances ALI data GTM Store
ingestion coordination with Linda while creating organizational
awareness of workbooks integration requirements and intent quality
prioritization planning.

The team navigates substantial resource constraints requiring strategic
trade-offs while maintaining November release commitments and addressing
urgent infrastructure scalability challenges preventing platform
capability degradation.
