# **PMM Engine Team Executive Roundup - November 17-21, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The team successfully shipped the first objection handling document for
GTM Studio and GTM Workspace this week, marking a significant milestone
in field enablement. Jennifer Scharrer completed the first draft of AI
messaging, positioning the team to finalize the AI Action Credits
messaging framework that sales and customer success need before
year-end. Brett Jacobs is advancing a weekly release cadence proposal
for Studio and Workspace that will fundamentally change how downstream
teams receive product updates---moving from reactive ad-hoc
communications to a structured one-week advance notice system. The
biggest immediate need is executive alignment on the contributory
network go-to-market strategy, as internal confusion escalated
unnecessarily this week and consumed valuable team resources.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Akshath Dorai delivered the first version of the objection handling
document for GTM Studio and GTM Workspace, which was circulated to
stakeholders and received positive feedback. This represents the team\'s
first attempt at creating a scalable, self-service tool that enables the
sales team to move faster without waiting for PMM support on every
pitch. The document will go through one more iteration next week based
on voice-of-customer feedback from Ken Elwell.

Jennifer Scharrer completed the first draft of AI messaging and is
sharing it with Adam and Rowan today after incorporating feedback from
Akshath. She also finished the 3-4 slide solution requested by Dominik
and Tal for pre-demo scenarios, sending it to Tori Spear for feedback
with the goal of submitting the design ticket today. The solution
pivoted from a complex HTML app to simple GIFs with talk tracks for
sellers based on direct input from Tori, who emphasized that sellers
need simplicity over sophistication.

AJ Belen successfully coordinated stakeholder sign-offs across multiple
workstreams this week, ensuring Victor and Sneh reviewed the objection
handling materials while Adam provided input on AI credit positioning.
The team is now positioned to move from foundational asset creation into
refinement and distribution phases, with enablement partnerships
becoming more structured through Emily\'s weekly meetings with Akshath.

### **Goals & Progress**

**GTM Studio & Workspace Enablement**: The objection handling document
has been circulated and is in a good place according to Akshath, with
most stakeholder feedback already incorporated. The team plans one more
version next week, transitioning from a static document approach to a
more dynamic objection handling agent that Akshath is building for
stakeholder testing. Jennifer completed the Studio and Workspace
integration asset faster than expected, though AJ noted he didn\'t
realize she was so far along on the 3-4 slides. Brett Jacobs interviewed
two candidates for the PMM Compete role to support Victor\'s team on
competitive positioning.

**AI Action Credits Messaging**: Akshath took the first stab at ZoomInfo
AI Action Credit messaging, producing a draft that Jennifer and AJ will
review this afternoon. The key debate centers on how to position the
value---Jennifer is advocating for framing it as where the company sits
on the \"pure seat-based to pure usage-based spectrum\" rather than
positioning it as seat versus usage. Akshath watched the video Jennifer
recommended and found it useful for understanding how the quadrants
shift based on the mix of seat-based versus AI credit costs. Jennifer
completed the broader AI messaging first draft and will share with Adam
and Rowan today.

**Release Cadence & Communication**: Brett Jacobs is driving a proposal
for a weekly release cadence for Studio and Workspace that will give
downstream teams one week advance notice with complete
information---release notes, how-to guides, and demos. This addresses
ongoing complaints from enablement and customer experience teams who
currently don\'t know what\'s releasing because the system relies on
Jagan manually filling in tickets amid an already overloaded schedule.
Brett is meeting with Emily, Mary, and other downstream teams to present
the approach, positioning it as an inform rather than a request.
Jennifer will support Brett on developing the communication plan for
this new cadence, including decisions about whether sellers receive
weekly updates, monthly digests, or available-versus-accountable
information structures.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Brett Jacobs is navigating the technical complexity of identifying
official product pitches within semantic data. While his team has a
developer with backend access who can filter transcripts to determine
when GTM Studio was the primary focus of a call versus just mentioned in
passing, the solution is expensive and not scalable. The semantic data
infrastructure needs better structure upfront to enable this kind of
analysis efficiently, creating a forcing function for the GTM Studio
team to improve their data setup. Brett expects to face pushback when he
informs downstream teams about the weekly release cadence, particularly
around questions like whether sellers need to be accountable for reading
weekly release notes or if the information should just be available.
There\'s tension between Henry\'s well-intentioned suggestion to email
customers weekly about new releases and the practical reality that this
cadence would create too much noise and customers won\'t absorb the
information.

The contributory network situation escalated beyond what it needed to
this week, consuming resources as multiple team members typed out
lengthy explanations and enablement became involved. Jennifer felt the
team could have nipped the issue in the bud with Jack earlier rather
than letting it snowball. While not a functional concern, the incident
highlighted the need for Heather and Brandon to finalize defensible
contributory network messaging so the field can deliver a simple
three-sentence pitch. AJ will be working with them on a plan, with the
potential for Jennifer to support the actual go-to-market strategy if
they decide to move forward rather than continue delaying until more
defensible plays exist.

Naming confusion around UI and UX features mentioned in Slack hasn\'t
been fully resolved, pointing to a broader question about what level of
naming decisions PMM should be involved in and who owns those decisions.
Jennifer plans to formalize this process but acknowledged it may not get
addressed next week given other priorities. The team also needs clarity
on feature selection for the monthly customer release---Jennifer has
placeholders for GTM Studio features but many tickets lack descriptions,
requiring her to meet with Jagan to understand which items are worth
featuring or if some can be packaged together into a compelling
narrative.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The team has been receiving one-off positive feedback about platform
messaging through Slack messages and platform decks, indicating the
foundational messaging work is resonating with internal stakeholders.
This validates the investment in comprehensive platform positioning even
as the team juggles multiple product-specific launches.

Jennifer discovered during her conversation with Tori Spear that sales
leaders strongly prefer simplicity over technical sophistication when it
comes to pre-demo engagement tools. The initial inclination toward an
HTML app solution was rejected as \"too complicated,\" leading to a
pivot toward simple GIFs with clear talk tracks. This reinforces the
principle that sellers need materials they can deploy quickly without
extensive training or technical setup.

The objection handling document process revealed that this is the first
time the team is attempting this format, creating natural learning
curves around stakeholder feedback collection and distribution. AJ\'s
decision to introduce Akshath in the first distribution was intentional
since not everyone knows him yet, but he\'s now empowered to own the
distribution process going forward without routing through AJ.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

The team\'s work with Emily from enablement continues to mature, with
Akshath now holding weekly meetings to coordinate on objection handling
documents and other assets. The discussion about embedding the objection
handling chatbot as an iframe in Seismic demonstrates the importance of
this partnership---enablement wants to track usage, and the technical
solution should be straightforward since iframing should be table stakes
for Seismic. Jennifer will surface this with Emily and Kayla to confirm
feasibility.

Victor\'s team requires ongoing PMM support on multiple fronts. Jennifer
met with Hari on enablement download materials and has been giving Dylan
feedback on artifacts he\'s building. She also supported the team on a
potential workspace enablement compete proposal, providing extensive
feedback to the PM even though she\'s uncertain whether he appreciated
all of her input. The team interviewed two PMM Compete candidates this
week to provide more dedicated support to Victor\'s initiatives.

Brett\'s weekly release cadence proposal will require significant
coordination with TPM, Steph, and Victor to get sign-off, followed by
downstream team alignment with Emily, Mary, and others. The challenge
isn\'t just getting agreement on the process but also working through
the second-order questions about how information flows to sellers,
customers, and different stakeholder groups. Jennifer offered to support
these conversations to ensure successful delivery regardless of who
leads them.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week presents planning challenges given the Thanksgiving holiday,
and the team expects to set lighter goals during the short week. The
focus will be on finalizing the AI Action Credits messaging with input
from Jessie who returns next week, continuing iteration on the objection
handling document based on voice-of-customer feedback, and getting the
pre-demo slide solution back from design and ideally into the deck.

Akshath will continue working on the AI Action Credits messaging
incorporating the feedback about positioning on the seat-based to
usage-based spectrum, complete the second round of objection handling
documentation, and advance the objection handling agent to a point where
stakeholders can begin testing it even if it\'s not fully complete. AJ
will iterate on the swimlanes document and review the AI Action Credit
messaging that Akshath started. Jennifer will formalize next steps on
use cases with the broader team including Lazer, Tori, and Emily in
their Monday meeting, determine what level of PMM involvement is
appropriate for feature naming decisions, and potentially support the
contributory network go-to-market strategy depending on how AJ\'s
conversation with Brandon and Heather progresses.

The team will also be working through the communication plan for
Brett\'s weekly release cadence, including decisions about available
versus accountable information for different audiences. If the pre-demo
slides come back from design quickly, Jennifer will work with enablement
to get them into the main deck, though some dependencies remain unclear.
The short holiday week means some initiatives will naturally extend into
the following week, but the team is positioned to close out the year
with strong foundational assets for AI Action Credits, objection
handling, and product release communications.
