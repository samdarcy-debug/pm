# **PMM Engine Team Executive Roundup - Week of November 10, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The team delivered the first Voice of Customer report this week, which
generated productive discussion at the ELT level and confirmed that the
platform narrative is resonating well in the field. Jennifer Scharrer,
Akshath Dorai, and AJ Belen are making progress on addressing field
confusion around Studio and Workspace positioning while building
foundational AI messaging assets. The objection handling agent reached
V1 status and is 80% ready for deployment, requiring only minor
refinements before rollout.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Brett Jacobs completed and delivered the first Voice of Customer report,
which was reviewed by the ELT on Thursday with strong engagement from
leadership including Dominik, Victor, Sneh, and Tuna. The report
validated that the platform narrative is resonating across sales teams,
with multiple sales leaders independently confirming this feedback. This
represents a significant milestone in establishing data-driven GTM
decision-making.

Akshath Dorai built the first version of the objection handling agent in
just one week, achieving 80% completion on outputs that can address
real-time field questions. The agent successfully processed the VOC
report and generated relevant responses, demonstrating the potential for
self-serve enablement at scale. While distribution mechanisms and
quality controls remain to be built, the core engine is functional and
ready for iteration.

Jennifer Scharrer separated AI positioning work into two distinct
frameworks after productive sessions with Jesse Lindstrom from Product.
The first addresses how ZoomInfo messages the AI and intelligence engine
powering the platform, while the second focuses specifically on how AI
action credits are positioned as a pricing model. This clarity will
prevent the conflation of product value with cost discussions that has
created confusion in early customer conversations.

### **Goals & Progress**

**GTM Studio & GTM Workspace**: The VOC report revealed field confusion
about when to use Studio versus Workspace, prompting discussion about
integrated demos that cover both products upfront. AJ Belen and the
leadership team are considering a revised demo approach where sellers
present both products initially, then lean into one based on customer
use cases and maturity. Jennifer Scharrer is developing 2-4 slide GIF
solutions to help sellers explain the Studio-to-Workspace flow without
requiring SC resources for every early-stage conversation. These visual
assets will require design team support and are estimated at a 3-week
timeline if storyboards can be finalized this week.

**Objection Handling Process**: Akshath Dorai completed V1 of the
objection handling agent and ran initial tests using VOC report inputs.
The agent requires 30-60 minutes of weekly refinement to reach
production quality, with next steps including integration of curated Q&A
assets from enablement and establishing a spreadsheet-based answer
repository. AJ Belen reviewed the output and provided feedback, noting
that several improvements can be made now without waiting for seller
input. The team plans to have a curated one-pager of top objections
ready by mid-next week, replacing the existing HTML objection handling
page that enablement currently maintains.

**Voice of Customer Loop**: Brett Jacobs established weekly ELT reviews
of the VOC report starting this Thursday, with Tuna joining as a
standing participant despite not being on the ELT. The report structure
and review cadence will enable rapid iteration on field feedback.
Dominik is pushing for weekly changelog or release notes covering PMM
updates, objection handling additions, and other field-facing changes to
maintain transparency on continuous improvement efforts.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The team identified overlapping but separate positioning needs for AI
capabilities that were causing confusion in both internal discussions
and customer conversations. Jennifer Scharrer and Jesse worked through
this during their session, realizing they needed distinct messaging
frameworks: one for the intelligence engine\'s value proposition and
another for the action credit pricing model. With Jesse out all of next
week, Jennifer will leverage Adam Smith as a resource to continue
progress, though the timing gap may slow iteration cycles on these
foundational assets.

Field teams are experiencing confusion about Copilot versus Workspace
positioning, particularly in renewal and growth scenarios where
customers already use Copilot with Account AI without credit charges.
While the directive to prioritize Workspace for new business has been
given, the tactical guidance on whether to mention Copilot at all
remains unclear. Additionally, the current guidance to default to
standard Copilot for prospects without Salesforce or interest in CRM
integrations may need revision, as expanded CRM support is on the
product roadmap though timing is not yet confirmed. This creates risk of
leaving Workspace revenue on the table with Dynamics and HubSpot
customers.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The VOC report revealed that sellers need visual aids to explain
cross-product workflows more than they need demo environments. The
request from the field isn\'t for SC support on every call but rather
for quick, accessible assets that let them say \"let me show you
something real quick\" the way they can with other products they have
direct access to. This insight is driving the GIF solution approach,
which will be more scalable than building demo environments or requiring
SC involvement in early conversations. The challenge is that Studio
access restrictions prevent sellers from doing quick product tours,
making polished visual assets necessary for early-stage positioning.

The objection handling agent work demonstrated that building the engine
first and distribution mechanisms second is the right sequencing.
Akshath Dorai\'s approach of focusing on output quality before tackling
Slack notifications, public access, and feedback loops aligns with the
team\'s capacity constraints. The agent\'s ability to reference a
curated spreadsheet of validated Q&A pairs will prevent drift in
messaging while still allowing the AI to address novel questions,
creating a hybrid model of human oversight and automated scale.

Separating AI intelligence positioning from AI credit pricing messaging
emerged as an unexpected but valuable insight from Jennifer Scharrer and
Jesse\'s brainstorming session. The two topics kept blurring together
during discussion, creating confusion about when to introduce cost
considerations versus when to establish value. This separation will
enable clearer customer conversations, with intelligence capabilities
discussed upfront to generate interest before introducing the pricing
model in a way that demonstrates customer benefit rather than vendor
monetization.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

The team\'s work with the design team on GIF assets requires clear
storyboarding this week to hit a 3-week delivery timeline, making
collaboration with visual design resources a pacing factor for the
Studio-Workspace positioning solution. Victor\'s team is exploring
Workspace as an enablement competitor (high spots, Seismic, Lessonly),
and Jennifer Scharrer will spend 1-2 hours with them next week providing
her perspective on where this makes sense versus where it doesn\'t. This
represents an interesting convergence of GTM needs and product direction
that could influence how the team thinks about Workspace positioning
long-term.

Enablement maintains an existing HTML objection handling page that will
need to be deprecated once Akshath Dorai\'s agent is production-ready.
Jennifer Scharrer proactively managed this by telling enablement to hold
off on extensive revisions to the current page, promising a replacement
in 1-2 weeks. This coordination will be important for avoiding confusion
about which resource is the source of truth, and the team will need to
ensure a clean handoff with enablement when the new agent launches.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s priorities center on refining the objection handling agent
to production quality, completing AI positioning and credit messaging
frameworks, and finalizing storyboards for the Studio-Workspace GIF
assets. With Jesse out all week, the team will rely more heavily on Adam
Smith for AI messaging input.

Akshath Dorai will iterate on the objection handling agent Tuesday
through mid-week, incorporating feedback from AJ Belen and Jennifer
Scharrer to reach a state where curated one-pagers can be distributed to
the field. The focus will be on integrating the existing enablement Q&A
content into the agent\'s reference spreadsheet and ensuring output
quality is high enough for self-serve use. Jennifer Scharrer will
complete first drafts of both AI messaging frameworks and continue work
on the launch process proposal, while also supporting Victor\'s team on
the Workspace-as-enablement exploration. AJ Belen will drive alignment
with enablement and sales on the AI action credit plan, ensuring
downstream teams understand the positioning and can execute effectively.

Sean Walters\' upcoming paternity leave means Ant will serve as the
Workspace DRI in the interim, which Akshath Dorai is already
coordinating with through a meeting scheduled this week. The team should
monitor whether this transition creates any gaps in product partnership
or roadmap clarity, particularly around CRM integration timing which
remains uncertain for Q1.
