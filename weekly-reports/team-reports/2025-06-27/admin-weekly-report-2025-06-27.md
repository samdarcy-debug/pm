# **Brannen\'s Team Executive Roundup - 6/27/25**

## **Executive Summary**

A critical lack of alignment on usage-based pricing for AI features is
jeopardizing our October launch target. **Brannen Huske** is blocked on
finalizing monetization requirements due to conflicting opinions on
whether to price based on cost (path-through) or value, and the use of
credits versus direct USD. Executive intervention is urgently needed to
establish a definitive pricing model to enable progress and ensure the
successful, on-time rollout of GTM Studio\'s AI capabilities.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Brannen Huske** made progress on requirements for usage-based
monetization, focusing on a money draw-down system. This foundational
work is crucial for enabling GTM Studio to charge for AI features,
directly impacting future revenue streams.

**Josh Simon** successfully finalized the design for the pricing page
flow, a critical step to reduce customer confusion and support tickets
for users on inactive packages. His proactive collaboration with
**Jessie Lindstrom** and other stakeholders aims to integrate the
\"upgrade to GTM Studio\" call-to-action seamlessly into the existing
marketing qualified lead system, streamlining the user journey and lead
capture.

**Jessie Lindstrom** made significant strides in documenting current
credit usage models and outlining potential \"quick win\" options for
credit management and pricing. Notably, she leveraged AI (Gemini) to
rapidly research industry standards, drastically reducing weeks of work
to just 3-4 hours, demonstrating a powerful new efficiency for strategic
analysis.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Usage-Based Monetization**: **Brannen Huske** has begun drafting
requirements for usage-based monetization, aiming for an October launch.
However, progress is currently stalled (0% complete for the PR) due to
ongoing, unaligned conversations regarding the fundamental pricing
mechanism (path-through vs. value-based) and currency (credits vs. USD).
Commitment on this decision is paramount to prevent further delays that
could jeopardize the October target.

**Pricing Page & Lead Flow**: **Josh Simon** has finalized the design
for the pricing page flow to enhance customer experience and reduce
support inquiries related to inactive packages. He is now collaborating
with **Kyle Coke**, **Tyson Chen**, and **Julie Nicholas** to ensure the
call-to-action for upgrading to GTM Studio is properly integrated into
the existing lead collection system, moving toward a more automated and
scalable lead generation process.

**Credit Model & Utilization Reporting**: **Jessie Lindstrom** has
nearly completed (90%) a detailed memo outlining current credit usage
problems and proposing options for improvement, validated by industry
research. While the memo is largely ready for leadership, the immediate
focus is pivoting to analyze current utilization reporting to better
inform the proposed credit solutions, ensuring a data-driven approach to
future pricing adjustments.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The primary strategic challenge is the **lack of definitive alignment on
the AI pricing model**. **Brannen Huske** highlights conflicting
opinions on whether to adopt a path-through cost model or a value-based
approach, and whether to utilize a credit system or direct USD pricing.
This indecision is directly blocking the completion of usage-based
monetization requirements and puts the critical October AI launch at
significant risk. A clear, committed decision is required from
leadership to unblock this workstream.

**Josh Simon** faces a significant blocker in **re-establishing customer
communication campaigns for product migrations**. Due to recent
restructuring, the product marketing motion for critical migration
efforts (e.g., Email 2.0 to A) has been lost. This impacts direct
communication with CSMs, AMs, and enterprise/mid-market customers,
hindering critical adoption initiatives and requiring a clear path
forward for effective outreach.

Another ongoing challenge, as identified by **Josh Simon**, is the
**lack of standardized data access across ZoomInfo products**.
Currently, the same dataset exists under three different SKUs (Sales,
Marketing, Talent), leading to mismatched access and integration
difficulties, such as Deck not working with MarketingOS. This
fragmentation requires a re-evaluation and potential re-architecture of
backend datasets to ensure seamless data leveraging across platforms.

Finally, **Jessie Lindstrom** noted potential capacity constraints with
Go-to-Market teams due to quarter-end activities, which could impact her
discovery work on credit models. She is mitigating this by leveraging
Chorus recordings and engaging tangentially related teams to gather
necessary insights.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

A significant learning this week, demonstrated by **Jessie Lindstrom**,
is the **transformative efficiency of using AI (Gemini) for market
research**. What traditionally took weeks to identify industry standards
and pros/cons for pricing methodologies was completed in just a few
hours, showcasing a powerful tool for accelerating strategic analysis.

Direct customer feedback, shared by **Jessie Lindstrom** from a ZoomInfo
customer (her husband), reinforced the **pervasive confusion around how
ZoomInfo credits work**. This anecdotal evidence underscores the
internal observations that current credit models lack transparency,
highlighting an opportunity to build greater customer trust and
understanding through clearer pricing and usage explanations.

Discussions around tenant-specific price books (as explored by **Brannen
Huske** and Adam) reveal that while potentially offering flexibility,
they could lead to a negative perception if two customers sharing the
same action see different costs based on negotiated credit prices. This
highlights the importance of **balancing pricing flexibility with
external perception and brand consistency**.

**Jessie Lindrom** also reflected on the **importance of agility and the
need to account for strategic pivots**. While initially focused on
credit memo completion, new priorities around unified users and
utilization requirements necessitated a shift. This insight emphasizes
the value of being reactive to new information and re-prioritizing for
the most impactful work, rather than strictly adhering to initial goals
if circumstances change.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work on AI monetization and credit strategies requires critical
alignment with **Adam, Dominic, and Mark** to establish a definitive
pricing model. **Brannen Huske\'s** progress on usage-based monetization
requirements is directly dependent on this decision.

**Josh Simon\'s** efforts to optimize the pricing page and lead flow
depend on collaboration with **Kyle Coke, Tyson Chen, and Julie
Nicholas** to correctly integrate the call-to-action into the marketing
qualified lead system. Additionally, re-establishing customer
communication for product migrations requires working closely with
**John** and other product marketing stakeholders.

The broader initiative to standardize data access across ZoomInfo\'s
platforms, essential for fixing issues like Deck\'s integration with
MarketingOS, will require significant collaboration with backend and
data engineering teams, potentially involving a **re-architecture of how
datasets are managed**.

## **Looking Ahead**

Our primary focus for the upcoming week is to unblock critical
workstreams and solidify foundational decisions, particularly around
pricing.

**Brannen Huske** will push for decisive alignment on the AI pricing
model to unlock the usage-based monetization requirements, which are
crucial for the October launch. He will also seek to make explicit in
upward reporting how necessary pivots and re-prioritization are
accounted for, advocating for agility rather than penalizing reactivity.

**Jessie Lindstrom** will shift her primary focus to analyzing current
utilization reporting to inform and refine the options proposed in her
credit usage memo. This will involve working with relevant stakeholders
to gather requirements and outline implementation timelines, ensuring
proposed solutions are data-driven and actionable.

**Josh Simon** will continue his follow-up with **Kyle Coke, Tyson Chen,
and Julie Nicholas** to finalize the pricing page design and ensure
correct lead flow integration. He will also prioritize following up with
**John** to re-establish the critical customer communication campaigns
for product migrations. Furthermore, **Josh** aims to dedicate time this
week to understanding and potentially re-evaluating the backend data set
architecture to address current data fragmentation issues across
ZoomInfo products.

The team remains committed to driving forward key initiatives despite
strategic challenges, maintaining a focus on business impact and
improving customer experience.
