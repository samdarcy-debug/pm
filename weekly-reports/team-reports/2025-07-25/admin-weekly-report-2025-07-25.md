## Executive Summary

This week, the team successfully secured approval for AI credits,
enabling their sale and quoting by sellers and through the ZI store. We
also finalized designs and backend infrastructure for the new login
pricing page flow, addressing a significant number of support tickets
and improving user experience. A key strategic challenge addressed was
the urgent reprioritization of contributory network work, which Jessie
Lindstrom successfully managed by re-shuffling team priorities.

## This Week\'s Progress

### Key Momentum Areas

This week, Brannen Huske successfully moved forward with AI credits by
getting NPI document approval and creating tickets for new AI credit
SKUs, allowing them to be quoted and sold. This is crucial for the
monetization of GTM Studio.

Josh Simon finalized the account information that can be pulled from
Salesforce to the login landing pages and created stories for the new
login pricing page flow. This pushes forward a main goal of the
partnership with the support team and integrates the login flow for
unassigned users with the leads team. He also confirmed that reference
users will be handled within SCIM provisioning, which will unblock new
reference user creation and boost SCIM adoption.

Jessie Lindstrom effectively managed priorities to handle the urgent
reprioritization of Contributory Network work. She was able to adapt and
prioritize this critical initiative, which supports the Contributory
Network\'s ability to add more data to the flywheel.

### Goals & Progress

**Login Experience:**: Josh Simon finalized the account information pull
from Salesforce to login landing pages and created stories for the new
login pricing page flow, ensuring all designs are feasible for relevant
information. This is 100% complete for the week.

**AI Credits:**: Brannen Huske completed the creation of AI Credit
tickets for the dev team, RevOps, and dependent teams, submitting the
NPI ticket and scheduling meetings. The dev tickets have been created
and refined. This goal is 100% complete for the week.

**Org Hierarchy**: Jessie Lindstrom successfully informed GTM Studio
dependencies at risk due to the urgent reprioritization of Contributory
Network dependencies, with a mitigation plan in place. Team agreed with
the trade-off with the mitigation plan is crucial for supporting the
Contributory Network\'s ability to contribute additional data to the
flywheel. This Contributory Network work will be complete for this
sprint..

### Strategic Challenges

A primary challenge this week, as highlighted by Jessie Lindstrom and
Brannen Huske, was the urgent reprioritization of contributory network
work. The effort required for this work and its timeline could impact
the timeline to resolve username collisions, delaying progress on
unified users and the Golden Org Hierarchy. It also had the potential to
impact AI Credit work and the larger GTM Studio timeline. This situation
necessitated flexible prioritization to ensure the team could meet the
contributory network\'s requirements.

Another challenge is figuring out how reference users will work within
SCIM provisioning, as identified by Josh Simon. This unblocks new
reference user creation with SCIM provisioning and will work in
conjunction with the drive to boost SCIM adoption. Currently, collision
issues are occurring with trials being upgraded to paid accounts,
causing errors when trying to provision existing users through SCIM.

Additionally, Brannen Huske has identified a blind spot regarding
ensuring correct reporting of AI credit usage to SAP, particularly with
the shift from reporting bulk credit purchases immediately as closed
revenue to reporting usage-based AI credits as open revenue that closes
as it is spent.

## Strategic Insights

### Key Learnings & Discoveries

A key learning from Jessie Lindstrom\'s work is the importance of
proactive dependency identification and flexible prioritization for the
provisioning team, as last-minute requirements frequently necessitate a
rapid reshuffling of planned work.

Josh Simon\'s efforts revealed that the PMM work is now much more
streamlined, with significant improvements to the ZI Chatbot based on
feedback.

Brannen Huske\'s work on AI credits has provided a clear understanding
of the revenue reporting process for usage-based credits, moving from
immediate closed revenue for bulk purchases to revenue being recognized
as credits are spent down.

### Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with the Salesforce team and RevOps was critical for finalizing
the login pricing page flow, enabling us to trigger leads and campaigns
in Salesforce.

The provisioning team and Contributory Network team are closely
intertwined, as urgent reprioritization for the Contributory Network
directly impacts the provisioning team\'s timeline and ability to
resolve other critical initiatives like username collisions and unified
user progress.

Coordination with Garrett Cummins\' team is essential to ensure AI
credit usage revenue is correctly reported to SAP, given the new model
of reporting revenue as credits are spent rather than at the point of
purchase.

## Looking Ahead

Next week, the team will continue to build on this week\'s progress with
a focus on finalizing key architectural and reporting elements.

Josh Simon will focus on locking in second-half goals and aligning for
\"login as\" and privacy work. He will also follow up with Sean and Lars
to discuss handling public and customer data in conjunction with agentic
deep research, aiming to be proactive rather than reactionary.

Brannen Huske\'s primary goal for next week is to review the AI credit
dev solution put together by the team and William Lam. This review will
inform the creation of development tickets. Additionally, Brannen will
collaborate with Garrett Cummins\' team to ensure accurate reporting of
AI credit usage revenue to SAP.

Jessie Lindstrom will collaborate with the agentic platform teams to
ensure that agents respect and enforce user entitlements, covering both
packaging (ensuring users only access what they\'ve paid for) and
role-based access control. This is crucial for maintaining data security
and adherence to product offerings.
