# **Apps Executive Roundup - Monday June 30 - Thursday July 3**

## **Executive Summary**

**The Apps team is hitting critical velocity on GTM Studio launch but
faces resource constraints that could derail Q3 deliverables.** Two
designers are out sick simultaneously, blocking UX research for Advanced
Search and Engagement History features that support Microsoft retention
and Copilot upsells. Meanwhile, engineering resources on Advanced Search
are reduced due to the Israel conflict, creating a cascade of delays on
accessibility requirements needed for Microsoft contract renewal in
August.

The team delivered strong progress on GTM Studio messaging and Gartner
positioning, but feedback cycles with executives are creating timeline
risk for the July 11 design handoff deadline. Without immediate
intervention on design resources and stakeholder feedback velocity, we
risk missing launch windows that directly impact revenue.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**GTM Studio foundation work accelerated significantly** with Jennifer
completing the first draft pitch deck and Lauren successfully
positioning our go-to-market intelligence narrative in the Gartner ABM
Magic Quadrant RFI submission. The 95-question RFI response, submitted
on Tuesday, weaves ZoomInfo\'s GTMI positioning directly into our ABX
market evaluation---critical groundwork for analyst recognition that
drives enterprise sales velocity.

**Pricing breakthrough on AI credits moved from blocked to approved
track** following productive Wednesday sessions with Adam Smith and
Mark. Lauren launched a 48-hour external validation survey to support
their ELT presentation, while the team established five major launch
milestones with clear ownership. This unblocks downstream marketing and
sales enablement work that was stalled waiting for pricing clarity.

**Embedded CI beta preparation reached 80% completion** with Gabe
creating internal and external artifacts plus identifying 20 target
customers with strong integration footprints (calendar, CRM, email
connections). Customer Success partnership with Elise will refine this
to five beta participants, setting up July timeline execution for a
feature that extends platform stickiness.

### **Goals & Progress**

**GTM Studio Messaging**: Jennifer achieved 60% completion on the
comprehensive pitch deck, with positive structural feedback but
significant detail refinement needed. The deck balances vision-selling
with concrete product details---critical for our practitioner-heavy
buyer personas who demand technical specifics alongside executive value
propositions. Final alignment targeted for July 11 to meet design
handoff requirements.

**Pre-Copilot Development**: Vinay reached 90% completion on all phases
moving to dev/ready for dev status. Strong PM-engineering collaboration
with Adam leading technical coordination and Valery providing TPM
support has eliminated most dependencies. The remaining 10% involves
tactical Card improvements based on AI Email learnings, scheduled for
completion next week.

**Intent Platform Scaling**: Al\'s team completed critical
infrastructure testing to double intent topic volume, addressing
year-long decay in signal strength that has generated customer
complaints and competitive disadvantage. Production testing begins next
week, with 2x volume boost targeting the intent signal reputation
recovery essential for retention.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Design resource crisis threatens multiple Q3 deliverables** as two
critical designers are simultaneously out sick. Advanced Search UX
research---essential for Microsoft accessibility compliance and August
contract renewal---cannot commence without design support. Similarly,
Engagement History UX work for Copilot upsells faces delays. The team
needs immediate design resource reallocation or temporary assignments to
prevent cascading timeline failures.

**Engineering capacity constraints on Advanced Search create compounding
risk** due to reduced Israel-based team availability during the
conflict. This impacts not only Microsoft accessibility requirements but
also natural language search development that represents our competitive
moat in the AI-driven search landscape. US-based engineering support may
be required to maintain critical path progress.

**Executive feedback loops on GTM Studio messaging are creating timeline
compression** despite strong initial reception. Jennifer flags that
multiple rounds with Dominic, Henry, and sales leadership could push the
July 11 design handoff deadline. The team needs accelerated
decision-making protocols or risk missing launch windows that align with
Q3 revenue targets.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**AI tooling limitations revealed in high-stakes messaging work** where
Jennifer discovered that while AI accelerates first-draft creation, the
critical refinement work remains 80% human-driven. This insight reshapes
expectations for AI-assisted content development timelines, particularly
for revenue-critical assets like pitch decks where every detail impacts
deal velocity.

**Customer feedback validation confirmed Intent Recommendation UI
success** through Harinath\'s user interviews, providing confidence in
the phase 2 development approach. However, the team identified critical
gaps in business metrics for measuring recommendation quality---a
fundamental requirement for data science team alignment and feature
optimization.

**Accessibility compliance urgency intensified** with Microsoft contract
renewal in August dependent on WCAG 2.2 AA compliance. Josh Simon\'s
review of standards revealed several cases involve 200% zoom
requirements that the platform doesn\'t currently support, requiring
architectural decisions on compliance scope versus development
investment.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

**Customer Success partnership critical for Embedded CI beta success**
requires Elise\'s support to refine customer selection and manage
introductions. This dependency affects July timeline execution but
represents necessary quality control for beta effectiveness.

**Data Science resource constraints on Intent Recommendation phase 2**
could impact timeline commitments as the team lacks sufficient data
science support for temporary Copilot demo requirements. This creates
risk for upsell feature development that directly impacts revenue
expansion.

## **Looking Ahead**

**Immediate action required on design resource allocation** to prevent
Q3 delivery failures across Advanced Search accessibility compliance and
Engagement History UX development. The team needs either expedited
recovery support for sick designers or immediate temporary assignments
from other design team members.

**GTM Studio messaging finalization becomes the critical path** for Q3
launch success, requiring accelerated executive feedback cycles and
decision velocity to meet July 11 design handoff. Success here unlocks
marketing team activation, sales enablement development, and web team
implementation for Agent and Plays pages.

**Microsoft renewal timeline creates non-negotiable August deadline**
for accessibility compliance, requiring potential US engineering support
if Israel-based team capacity remains constrained. This directly impacts
contract retention and demonstrates enterprise commitment to
accessibility standards.

The team has built strong momentum on revenue-critical initiatives but
needs immediate resource intervention to maintain delivery timelines
that directly impact Q3 business objectives.
