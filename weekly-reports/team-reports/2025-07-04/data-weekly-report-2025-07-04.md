# **Data Team Executive Roundup - Monday June 30 - Thursday July 3**

## **Executive Summary**

**The Data team is executing well on tactical deliverables but faces
critical infrastructure bottlenecks that will constrain Q4 revenue
potential.** While the Contractor Cube launches July 9th with strong GTM
alignment, systematic resource constraints in analysis capacity and
engineering prioritization are creating execution debt that threatens
our ability to capitalize on the inbound lead acceleration
opportunity---our biggest Q4 revenue driver.

**Immediate Action Required:** Executive intervention needed on CN Admin
Panel prioritization (Hannan\'s team) and analysis resource allocation
to prevent Q4 delivery risk.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Contractor Cube Go-Live Secured:** Dow Jones delivered all GTM
enablement materials, targeting, and sales collateral for July 9th
launch. Sales has everything needed to begin outbound motion on this
highly-requested SKU that should drive meaningful near-term revenue. The
team demonstrated strong cross-functional execution despite
end-of-quarter timing constraints.

**Buyer Engagement Maps Breakthrough:** Brandon Tucker\'s team achieved
a significant technical milestone by successfully building agents that
can produce comprehensive buyer engagement maps on-demand, including
organizational hierarchy data never before accessible. This directly
addresses high-value co-op use cases and demonstrates our ability to
leverage AI for data resolution---a critical capability for scaling
operations.

**Person-Based News Signal Optimization:** Steve Hutchinson completed
funnel analysis revealing that 83% of raw signals are lost in topic
assignment automation, but those making it through have an 85%
acceptance rate. This represents a massive opportunity to increase
signal throughput with process adjustments rather than additional
resources.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Agent Development (50% Complete):** Two AI agents in
development---Data Correction Agent and Buyer Engagement Map---showing
promise for automating resolution bottlenecks. Current limitation is
scaling beyond local machine processing, requiring infrastructure
investment to achieve production readiness.

**2H Planning PRDs (60% Complete):** Bert Lui made partial progress on
Copilot v2 and GTM Studio Account Prioritization PRDs, with initial
reviews scheduled. Progress constrained by key stakeholder availability
during planning week.

**Customer-Facing Materials (95% Complete):** Ethan Young nearly
completed customer-facing deck for company definition, identifying
significant opportunity to clean up over/under-combined companies using
new techniques before full definition implementation.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Analysis Resource Crisis:** Multiple team members (Ethan Young, Jody
Roberts) reporting critically low analysis capacity due to competing
priorities and team members on leave. This is constraining progress on
high-impact initiatives including company definition work and 5x5 data
utilization---both critical for Q4 product offerings.

**CN Admin Panel Engineering Bottleneck:** Brandon Tucker flagged
\"Critical\" blocker with CN Admin Panel updates. Root cause analysis
reveals complex backend ownership issues and lack of clear
prioritization, despite Hannan\'s team being identified as best
engineering owner. This directly impacts contributory network
capabilities.

**Company Source Creation Frozen:** Dana Hurtig reports company pipeline
freeze creating uncertainty around adding new companies, with knowledge
transfer held up pending resolution. This impacts our ability to
maintain data freshness and completeness.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**AI Agent Value Chain Clarification:** The team discovered that
identifying data issues is straightforward, but automated resolution is
the true bottleneck. This insight is reshaping agent development
strategy from detection-focused to resolution-focused approaches,
potentially delivering higher ROI with fewer resources.

**GTM Operations Velocity Gap:** Dow Jones identified that sales and
marketing operations are significantly slower than product development
cycles. The team is building automation and self-service capabilities to
reduce external dependencies---a pattern that should be replicated
across other GTM touchpoints.

**5x5 Data Utilization Scope:** Jody Roberts\' analysis revealed teams
are risk-averse toward new data source additions, requiring low-risk
implementation strategies while exploring mid/long-term improvements in
parallel. This has implications for how we introduce other high-value
data sources.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

**Engineering Prioritization Alignment:** Multiple critical initiatives
(CN Admin Panel, company definition technical requirements, VRS
optimization) require engineering resources that lack clear
prioritization frameworks. The team needs product leadership to
establish clear priority hierarchies to prevent resource contention.

**GTM Studio Integration Timeline:** The inbound lead acceleration
workflow depends on visitor resolution service improvements and GTM
Studio platform readiness. Current VRS has potential to scale from 180
to 1,600+ person matches from anonymous visits, but requires quality
testing infrastructure before Q4 launch.

## **Looking Ahead**

**Q4 Revenue Opportunity Crystallizing:** The team is aligned on inbound
lead acceleration as the primary Q4 revenue driver, with visitor-to-lead
workflows offering compelling demo value. Early testing shows potential
to increase person identification from website visits by 8x, directly
supporting GTM Studio platform fees and custom data set sales.

**Resource Constraint Resolution Required:** Next week\'s success
depends on resolving analysis capacity constraints and securing
engineering prioritization for CN Admin Panel work. Without
intervention, tactical execution will continue but strategic initiatives
will remain stalled.

**Copilot Renewal Tailwinds:** Early indicators show Copilot renewals
trending positive compared to historical SalesOS rates, providing
confidence in Q4 renewal cycle performance. This creates favorable
conditions for expanding GTM Studio adoption among existing customers.

The team has strong technical execution capabilities and clear strategic
direction, but requires immediate executive support to remove systemic
bottlenecks that could constrain Q4 revenue potential.
