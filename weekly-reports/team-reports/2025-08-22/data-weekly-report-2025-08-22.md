Data Executive Roundup - August 18th -
August 21, 2025

Executive Summary

Critical Win: Successfully infused 220,000 new companies (70,000 Tier A) via the Data Infusion
Platform, unlocking millions of LatAm contacts and validating our ability to scale company
additions from multiple data sources. This breakthrough removes our primary bottleneck for
geographic expansion and positions us to accelerate vertical dataset development. Rob Priore
secured Email Sender Provider Coalition approval pathway and advanced privacy compliance
initiatives, while Dow Jones completed comprehensive GTM enablement across all teams with
strong field response for our $10M H2 vertical dataset goal.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Data Infrastructure Breakthrough: Dana Hurtig led the successful completion of our first major
company infusion via DIP, adding 220,000 new companies with 70,000 being Tier A quality. This
validates our scaled approach to geographic expansion and unlocks an estimated 1.4 million
contacts from LatAm markets--critical for customers like Oracle, NetSuite, Uber, and Salesforce
who prioritize these regions.

Go-to-Market Acceleration: Dow Jones delivered comprehensive vertical dataset training to all
GTM teams (managers, R&G, new business, and frontline sellers), rolling out clear account
targeting and positioning frameworks. The field response generated hundreds of qualified leads,
indicating strong market demand for our restaurant, contractor, and franchise datasets as we
drive toward our $10M H2 revenue target.

Privacy and Compliance Leadership: Rob Priore achieved legal approval pathway for Email
Sender Provider Coalition membership and advanced Chorus/Outreach data ingestion for email
deliverability use cases. His proactive privacy scanning of 100K+ ACV accounts identified
compliance gaps early, protecting ZoomInfo from potential regulatory exposure while building
new revenue opportunities around email deliverability expertise.

Goals & Progress

Email Generation Enhancement: Steve Hutchinson completed comprehensive email source
evaluation, analyzing deliverability rates across Marketo, Engage, Zipi Signatures, Google
Directories, Crawler, and CN emails. Quality ranged from 86-96% deliverability, providing the
Data Science team with robust feature engineering inputs for the new email generation model
that will improve upon our current 72% deliverability rate (up from 67% in March).

Semantic Signal Development: Brandon Wilson mapped 95% of Account AI summary data
sources, refresh rates, and coverage metrics, creating a consolidated reference that eliminates
duplicate processing costs. This analysis enables direct integration with the Data Services API,
significantly reducing latency and compute expenses for semantic-enhanced signals while
improving accuracy through better context.

Agent Platform Expansion: Ethan Young progressed on analysis workflow agents despite
team scaling challenges, while Jody Roberts secured dedicated engineering resources for
shared services (one from PTI, one from Company team) with minimal roadmap impact. The
shared services kickoff scheduled for Monday will accelerate data standardization and
accessibility across R&D teams.

Strategic Challenges

Vertical Dataset Pipeline Management: As we scale from 3 to 10+ vertical datasets, we face
increasing complexity managing independent pipelines that must integrate with core company
assets. Each dataset (restaurant, franchise, contractor) requires industry-specific attributes to
influence company profiles, licensing considerations, and contract factors. Without architectural
changes to Company 3.0, we risk creating unsustainable technical debt as pipeline
maintenance scales non-linearly.

Agent Deployment Path Uncertainty: While we're building valuable agents for analysis
workflows and data insights, the path to customer deployment remains unclear for both ZI Chat
and the Agentic R&D platform. BigQuery/Snowflake connectivity limitations block several
high-impact agents, and we lack clarity on how custom APIs or LLM-based normalizations will
reach customers through Copilot 2.0 or GTM Studio without dedicated product roadmap
alignment.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

Company Infusion Quality Validation: The Rhetorik data analysis revealed 43% of URLs are
inactive, causing profiles to be unpublished, but many represent valid small businesses
(especially in Brazil) that simply lack working websites. This insight reshapes our pre-validation
approach and suggests we need geography-specific quality thresholds rather than universal
standards for company activation.

GTM Vertical Dataset Demand Validation: Training sessions confirmed strong seller
confidence and customer interest in vertical datasets, but highlighted critical gaps in our
enablement process and data readiness requirements. The high volume of follow-up questions
indicates we need standardized messaging frameworks and self-service evaluation tools to
scale effectively across our expanding dataset portfolio.

Email Deliverability Root Cause Analysis: Competitive health testing shows 96%
deliverability for ReachOut contact patterns versus declining rates for bulk exports, confirming
that employment status accuracy and contact freshness drive deliverability more than email
generation algorithms. This suggests prioritizing contact lifecycle management over solely
improving generation models.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with the GTM teams on vertical dataset operationalization continues to be critical for
achieving our $10M H2 revenue target. Training completion and account targeting rollouts are
proceeding smoothly, but data readiness for restaurant, franchise, and Form 5500 datasets
requires accelerated development focus to meet field demand.

Platform team coordination remains essential for agent deployment pathways, as
BigQuery/Snowflake connectivity gaps currently block customer-facing delivery of several
high-impact data analysis and insights agents that could differentiate our GTM Studio and
Copilot offerings.

Looking Ahead

Next week focuses on capitalizing on this week's company infusion breakthrough by analyzing
unlocked contact opportunities and queueing additional LatAm companies for processing while
advancing our second wave of geographic expansion targets.

Priority execution areas include: Dow Jones leading restaurant/franchise dataset GTM
readiness with customer assets and use case development; Brandon Wilson implementing the
Data Services API integration to dramatically reduce semantic signal processing costs and
latency; Dana Hurtig completing analysis of the 1.4M contacts unlocked by new company
additions and initiating our next DIP infusion cycle. Steve Hutchinson will finalize email source
analysis handoff to Data Science for new model development, while Rob Priore advances the
California/Oregon opt-out workflow technical implementation.

Strategic positioning: The successful DIP validation positions us to accelerate Company 3.0
planning discussions and vertical dataset pipeline optimization. With proven ability to scale
company additions and strong GTM field response, we're positioned to exceed our H2 targets
while building the foundation for 2026 geographic and vertical expansion opportunities.
