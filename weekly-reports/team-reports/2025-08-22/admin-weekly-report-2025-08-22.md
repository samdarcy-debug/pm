## Executive Summary

The team made significant progress on the AI price book, finalizing the
packaging of vertical datasets, and completing the LoginAs discovery
work. The single most important thing executives need to know is that
while the AI price book requirements are 80% complete, a decision on
reporting requirements for GTM Studio Release is critically needed to
unblock final technical design. Brannen Huske, Jessie Lindstrom, and
Josh Simon have all made key advancements, but the next steps for the AI
price book initiative are dependent on input from Agentic Platform and
Workbook team.

## This Week\'s Progress

### Key Momentum Areas

The team successfully created a repeatable pattern for selling
verticalized datasets, defining a new \"VDS\" namespace for entitlements
in GTM Studio. Brannen Huske completed this goal, positioning us to
drive revenue and support the company\'s \$10 million ACV revenue target
by the end of the year.

Jessie Lindstrom\'s team advanced the AI price book requirements to 80%
completion, obtaining target dates from engineering. This progress is a
key step toward the ability to charge for AI credits by the October 1st
deadline, and it is a testament to the team\'s ability to drive forward
on a complex and emerging initiative.

Josh Simon finalized the LoginAs discovery process by shadowing CX teams
and gathering passionate feedback from 82 respondents across various
departments. The breadth of this feedback, coupled with interviews,
provides the necessary data to move forward with a product review
document that addresses both technical and organizational challenges.

### Goals & Progress

**AI Price Book Initiative**: The requirements for the AI price book are
at 80% completion, with engineering dates targeted. The main remaining
piece is to define the reporting requirements for GA, which is a blocker
to the final technical design. Jessie Lindstrom\'s goal for next week is
to get this feedback and schedule tickets in upcoming sprints.

**LoginAs Discovery**: Josh Simon\'s high-level goal was to finalize the
LoginAs discovery, which he just about did. He has completed interviews
and collected survey data, which will be consolidated into a product
review document to be worked on with Brannen Huske in the next couple of
weeks.

**Vertical Datasets**: Brannen Huske completed his high-leverage goal of
finalizing the requirements for packaging vertical datasets at 100%.
This was achieved by defining a repeatable pattern using a new \"VDS\"
namespace that can support the addition and monetization of new
datasets.

### Strategic Challenges

The AI price book technical design is blocked because a clear definition
of reporting must-haves for GA is still being defined. This requires
Agentic Platform and Workbook's input..

Josh Simon\'s discovery on the LoginAs project revealed a significant
challenge: the feature has become so ingrained in the company culture
that it is used as a \"crutch\" by most organizations for their job
functions. This means the solution will require not only technical
changes but also significant organizational and cultural management.

The persistent log-out issue that customers face may be solved by an
HTTP-Only cookie, which is our leading theory. However, testing the
solution requires reaching out to customers like HubSpot users to verify
the fix on their systems, and the team is currently waiting on responses
from those customers.

## Strategic Insights

### Key Learnings & Discoveries

A key learning from the AI price book work is that AI pricing is far
more complex than initially assumed, with many levers to pull beyond
just margin. The market is still figuring this out, and our team must be
comfortable with the unknowns and be agile in our response. Jessie
Lindstrom noted that AI pricing is even more variable and volatile than
traditional pricing, which will require frequent and stringent review.

The discovery on the LoginAs work revealed that product managers have
become \"lazy\" by relying on the feature as a crutch instead of
creating proper back-office mechanisms. This insight confirms that the
problem is not just technical but also requires a change in how we build
products to support back-office users.

Brannen Huske learned that creating a centralized platform for LLM and
token calculation, as is being done for the AI price book, reduces
redundant logic across different agentic platforms. This validates the
strategic decision for a centralized model and highlights the benefit of
a single platform area for these calculations.

### Cross-Team Dependencies

The work on the AI price book is dependent on the Agentic team to
clarify whether they will be sending usage data in credits or USD. This
decision directly impacts whether a conversion service is needed for the
price book. A TPM is leading a meeting this week to get this resolved.

## Looking Ahead

Our primary focus for next week is to finalize key requirements to
unblock development and set the stage for a smooth Q4 execution.

Jessie Lindstrom will finalize the AI price book reporting requirements
to close out the design and schedule tickets for the next sprint,
ensuring that work can begin while she is on PTO. Brannen Huske will
continue to work with Josh Simon on finalizing the LoginAs product
review document. This is a critical next step to schedule a product
review and continue to move the initiative forward.

The team\'s work this week has provided clear next steps for our key
initiatives. While challenges remain, we are confident in our ability to
deliver on our strategic goals and continue to provide value.
