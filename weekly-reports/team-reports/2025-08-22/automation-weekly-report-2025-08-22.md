# **Automation Executive Roundup - 8/22/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**MCP platform leadership opportunity emerges as production launch
reaches final stages, while Workbook-Copilot Pro integration patterns
unlock new automation value.** Adam Peretz achieved 95% completion on
MCP server production readiness and identified a significant opportunity
to establish the automation team as the company\'s center of excellence
for MCP tools and best practices. Marc Frail completed strategic pivot
work and uncovered a potentially valuable Workbook-to-Copilot Pro API
integration pattern. Sam Massie reached 90% completion on flexible data
mapping designs despite discovering legacy action compatibility
requirements.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Adam Peretz positioned the team as company-wide MCP platform
leaders**, discovering widespread internal interest in MCP tool
development and working with Frank Shaw to establish scalable processes
and standards. The authentication gateway being built for ZI API MCP
tools can be extended to serve other teams, creating platform leverage
and establishing the automation team as the go-to expertise center for
cutting-edge agentic integration work.

**Marc Frail reviewed potential Workbook-Copilot Pro activation path,**
there's clear appetite for streamlined Workbooks↔Copilot Pro flows.
After reviewing the supported API we should revisit the **Workbook →
Copilot Pro** import/migration as a first-class path, using current
capabilities to cut complexity and support core use cases.

**Sam Massie advanced flexible data mapping toward engineering
handoff**, achieving 90% completion on design work that enables workflow
steps to handle diverse data types without schema requirements. The
type-agnostic approach maintains user simplicity while supporting the
extensibility goals essential for both current workflows and future
automation scenarios.

### **Goals & Progress**

**MCP Production Launch**: Adam Peretz reached 95% completion on MCP
server production readiness, with launch planned for next week after
final validation. The timeline represents successful navigation of
authentication challenges identified in previous weeks, positioning
ZoomInfo for early leadership in agentic tool integration.

**Strategic Platform Expansion**: Marc Frail completed 100% of
pivot-related restructuring work while evaluating opportunities in
Workbook-Copilot Pro integration patterns. The investigation into
API-first approaches across ZoomInfo applications reveals potential for
standardized automation patterns that could simplify cross-system
workflows.

**Legacy System Integration**: Sam Massie achieved 90% completion on
flexible data mapping designs but discovered the need for new matching
steps to support legacy actions that expect ZoomInfo IDs. This
requirement adds complexity but ensures backward compatibility during
the transition to more flexible data handling.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Legacy action compatibility creates additional development scope**,
with Sam Massie discovering that supporting existing workflow actions
requires new matching step functionality. While not blocking current
progress, this represents additional engineering work needed to maintain
system continuity during data mapping upgrades.

**API-first adoption varies across internal teams**, with Marc Frail\'s
investigation revealing inconsistent approaches to API development
across ZoomInfo applications. This creates integration complexity and
suggests a need for broader platform standards beyond just automation
team deliverables.

**MCP expertise coordination requires careful positioning**, as Adam
Peretz identified multiple teams building MCP tools without centralized
standards. While this creates opportunity for platform leadership, it
also requires diplomatic navigation to avoid stepping on existing team
territories or duplicating efforts.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Company-wide MCP interest validates platform investment**, with
multiple teams actively building agentic tools and seeking standards for
development. Adam Peretz\'s team is uniquely positioned to provide this
guidance, having already solved authentication and gateway challenges
that other teams will face.

**Workbook-Copilot Pro integration represents immediate value
opportunity**, as Marc Frail\'s analysis suggests that API flows between
these systems could be improved to reduce complexity while supporting
standard operations. This pattern could serve as a template for other
cross-system integrations.

**Flexible data mapping requires legacy system accommodation**, with Sam
Massie discovering that true platform flexibility means supporting both
new type-agnostic approaches and existing systems that depend on
specific data formats like ZoomInfo IDs.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Frank Shaw collaboration on MCP platform architecture is essential for
establishing company-wide standards and avoiding conflicts with existing
API platform work. The relationship leverages existing expertise while
extending it into new agentic domains.

Engineering coordination remains critical for documenting Routes as
workflow steps and data connector actions, with Marc Frail\'s API
pattern investigation requiring technical validation of feasibility and
complexity.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on MCP production launch while expanding platform
leadership opportunities and advancing Workbook integration patterns.

Adam Peretz will complete final MCP server validation and launch while
being out of office all week, requiring careful coordination of launch
activities. Marc Frail will continue exploring Workbook-to-Copilot Pro
integration patterns while working with engineering to document Routes
as workflow components and investigating Workbook row events and
API-based record addition.

Sam Massie will close remaining design questions around flexible data
mapping integration with legacy components, ensuring the new system
supports both forward-looking extensibility and backward compatibility
with existing workflow actions.

The convergence of MCP platform leadership opportunity, Workbook
integration discoveries, and flexible data mapping completion creates
potential for the automation team to establish broader platform
influence while delivering immediate automation value across multiple
ZoomInfo systems.
