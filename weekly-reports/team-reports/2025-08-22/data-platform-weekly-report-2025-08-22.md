# **Data Platform Team Executive Roundup - 8/22/25**

## **Executive Summary**

**External Query API commitment secured for November release**: Linda
Johannessen obtained commitment from the External API team to support
end-of-November externalization despite capacity constraints, removing a
critical execution risk. Marc Delurgio\'s stakeholder interviews
revealed enthusiastic alignment for a monthly Data Platform Review
cadence starting September, creating the execution rhythm needed for
improved scope and timing communication across platform and apps teams.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**API externalization path now clear**: Linda Johannessen\'s
collaboration with the External API team resulted in commitments for
November delivery, with the team confident they can deliver if work
begins in October. This removes the primary timeline risk for external
GraphQL support and provides scheduling certainty for stakeholder
planning.

**Cross-functional alignment accelerating**: Menna Rashwan completed all
Workbooks GA requirements for September, with Phase 1 Signals use cases
and Partner Data job posting enrichment fully implemented in staging.
All additional requirements have been delivered and communicated to
stakeholders, positioning the team for smooth September delivery.

**Process improvements gaining traction**: Marc Delurgio\'s interviews
with 8 PM and engineering leaders generated enthusiastic support for
monthly Data Platform Reviews, creating a structured forum to demo
successes and communicate the next month's priorities. This addresses
past communication gaps and establishes predictable milestone cadence.

### **Goals & Progress**

**API Development**: Linda Johannessen achieved breakthrough progress on
external API alignment, moving from uncertainty to firm commitment.
While detailed scope remains to be defined in October, both teams
express confidence in November delivery feasibility. The External API
team\'s confirmation of no December code freezes provides additional
execution flexibility for any needed iterations.

**Workbooks Integration**: Menna Rashwan completed 100% of requirements
for September GA, with all Phase 1 Signals workflows and Partner Data
enrichment supported through Federated Search. Implementation is live in
staging with stakeholder validation in progress, maintaining September
delivery confidence.

**Technical Architecture**: Moshik Levin completed the technical gap
inventory between Everstring and Match Service for location matching,
identifying key differences without uncovering major blockers. The team
successfully documented scenarios for stakeholder review and is planning
additional rounds to capture missing use cases before solution design.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**GraphQL External API scope definition is pending**: While External API
commitment is secured, detailed work breakdown and resource allocation
won\'t be available until October due to team capacity constraints. This
creates planning uncertainty for November externalization, though both
teams maintain confidence in delivery feasibility given current
architectural alignment.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Monthly review cadence addresses core communication gaps**: Marc
Delurgio\'s stakeholder interviews revealed strong appetite for
structured progress communication, validating the hypothesis that
execution challenges stem partly from coordination rather than technical
complexity. This alignment suggests this process change could
significantly improve delivery predictability.

**Staging validation creates execution confidence**: Menna Rashwan\'s
successful deployment of Workbooks requirements to staging demonstrates
the value of early stakeholder feedback loops. This approach allows
requirement validation before GA, reducing launch risk and creating
smoother delivery paths.

**Technical gap analysis prevents future surprises**: Moshik Levin\'s
systematic comparison between Everstring and Match Service revealed
manageable differences without major architectural conflicts. This
proactive approach creates foundation for informed decision-making and
support team knowledge transfer.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the External API team on GraphQL externalization continues
to be critical for November delivery. Current status shows strong
commitment but delayed detailed planning due to October capacity
constraints. The team\'s confidence in delivery feasibility and
confirmation of no December code freezes provides execution flexibility
while maintaining timeline integrity.

Workbooks team coordination remains essential for September GA success,
with Menna Rashwan\'s staging implementation creating clear validation
path. Stakeholder feedback collection is in progress with finalization
expected soon, supporting on-time delivery confidence.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on process establishment and technical solution
design, building on this week\'s commitment and completion achievements.

**September monthly review preparation** becomes top priority, with Marc
Delurgio developing communication templates and scheduling the inaugural
meeting. Success requires each team member to define September epics
with clear deliverables and dates, creating the structured progress
tracking that stakeholders endorsed. **Technical solution design**
advances through Moshik Levin\'s second round of gap analysis and Adwait
Kirtikar\'s cross-team coordination session for Unified Profile
development. **Stakeholder validation** concludes for Workbooks GA
through app team feedback on staging implementation, finalizing
September readiness.

The team enters next week with clear commitments, completed
deliverables, and established processes that position us for sustained
execution velocity through Q4.
