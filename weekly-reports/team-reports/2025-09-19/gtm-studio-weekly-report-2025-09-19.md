# **GTM Studio Executive Roundup - September 15-19**

## **Executive Summary**

The GTM Studio agent is rapidly approaching market readiness with 15+
internal users now onboarded and providing overwhelmingly positive
feedback, calling it a \"game changer\" for capabilities they previously
couldn\'t achieve. Jagannath is targeting a go/no-go decision by
Wednesday based on internal validation, while simultaneously preparing
for the October 16th Dreamforce demo where every attendee will likely be
a ZoomInfo customer. The team faces a technical blocker with semantic
search scalability that\'s preventing enterprise customer demos,
requiring immediate engineering escalation.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Jagannath successfully onboarded 15+ internal users to the GTM Studio
agent, exceeding the initial goal of 10 users. The feedback has been
consistently positive, with users describing breakthrough moments where
they can complete end-to-end journeys through natural conversation
alone. Rob Lauren from sales leadership recently completed a full ICP
building workflow using only conversational interface, demonstrating the
platform\'s potential to reshape how B2B teams interact with data and
automation tools.

Mohan made significant progress on Co Pilot activation alignment,
establishing clear understanding between the context and configure teams
on backend data structure. The team successfully reframed the GTM config
work as \"GTM config agent\" rather than onboarding, which clarified
scope and priorities across multiple stakeholders. Engineering resources
have been identified to begin agent work on Monday.

Tanvi advanced the signals initiative to staging with both signal
enrichment and signal-based workbook creation ready for testing. The
team completed multiple bug review sessions and made necessary
trade-offs to address last-minute technical complexities. Smart sheet\'s
early access program reinforced the person-has-moved use case that
bridges current Enrich Premium Plus and RingLead capabilities.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Agent Development**: The GTM Studio chat agent moved to production
with 15+ active internal users providing validation feedback. Jagannath
integrated AI email generation capabilities into GTM Studio using the
agent framework, with staging deployment complete and production release
planned for next week. The team established product analytics and
production readiness frameworks to support wider rollout decisions.

**Data Infrastructure**: Engineering completed GTM Data store migration
work and deployed to staging environment. Arun\'s team tested 5 beta
accounts with 99% data matching between legacy ZDP tables and new GTM
Data store tables. Multiple ROI analytics features launched this week
including Q agent enhancements, advanced filtering by interaction types,
and improved CRM error handling for better user guidance.

**Workbook Capabilities**: Tanvi pushed signals production release to
September 30th to accommodate comprehensive testing and bug fixes. The
team discovered federated search limitations when layering data points
from different sources, implementing temporary workarounds while
planning transition to another architecture later this year. Smart sheet
validation confirmed dynamic contact search patterns that span multiple
data sources.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The semantic search layer continues blocking enterprise demos despite
repeated assurances from engineering that issues are resolved. Jagannath
escalated this as a technical scalability issue after Silver Fort demo
had to be postponed for the second time in two weeks. This capability
represents significant market differentiation, and the continued delays
are preventing customer validation of key value propositions that
distinguish GTM Studio from Clay and other competitors.

Workbook user onboarding revealed consistent patterns where early access
customers feel overwhelmed by capabilities and request more guidance,
templates, and starter use cases. While the positive overwhelm indicates
product-market fit potential, the lack of structured onboarding may
limit adoption velocity and engagement retention. Tanvi identified this
as similar to historical RingLead implementation challenges that
required extensive customer success resources.

Cross-functional dependencies remain complex as the team balances route
pricing strategy with GTM Studio integration. The existing \$7 million
route revenue stream needs clear packaging decisions as routing
capabilities migrate into workbooks. Brahm highlighted the importance of
understanding revenue impact as features previously sold separately
become integrated platform capabilities.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Clay\'s conference event this week launched competing agent
capabilities, prompting immediate competitive analysis needs. Jagannath
will build battle cards to address internal questions about
differentiation and positioning. The timing suggests the conversational
AI space for B2B operations is accelerating rapidly, validating GTM
Studio\'s strategic direction while emphasizing execution urgency.

Rob Lauren\'s end-to-end journey completion using only conversational
interface provided concrete validation of the agent\'s potential to
transform application development patterns. This breakthrough moment
demonstrated that complex multi-step workflows requiring various data
sources and decision points can be completed through natural language
alone, suggesting traditional UI experiences may become secondary
interfaces within 2-3 years.

Early access program feedback revealed consistent patterns around
guidance and template needs across multiple customer segments. Smart
sheet, Silver Fort, and other prospects all requested similar onboarding
structures, suggesting scalable solutions for user activation. The
pattern mirrors successful implementation approaches but requires
proactive design to avoid resource-intensive custom guidance models.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Data management milestone alignment between Corina and Ash continues
progressing with M2 requirements handed off to engineering and
pre-grooming sessions completed. Health scan dashboard POC development
involves ongoing collaboration with account management to ensure sales
narrative strength for Q4 revenue capture.

Tingting\'s GTM config agent work requires continued alignment with
context team on database structure and postgres integration. The Monday
engineering kickoff will determine prototype feasibility and identify
any missing tools or endpoints needed for zero-configuration data flows.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on the critical go/no-go decision for broader GTM
Studio agent rollout, with Wednesday as the decision point based on
internal user validation. Simultaneously, Dreamforce preparation
intensifies with demo environment setup and public workbook sharing
capabilities for lead generation.

The team will escalate semantic search resolution while building Clay
competitive analysis and battle cards for internal enablement. Mohan
leads Co Pilot activation engineering kickoff on Monday, while Tanvi
continues signals testing toward September 30th production release. Data
management advances both health scan dashboard development and M4-M5
requirement documentation to maintain momentum toward Q4 sales
enablement.

Engineering sprint planning will incorporate GTM Data store migration
completion, multi-currency support implementation, and taxonomy
integration for GA readiness. The convergence of these initiatives
positions October as a pivotal month for both internal validation and
early customer conversion through paid POC programs.
