DAI Executive Roundup - [Monday
September 15th, 2025 - Friday September
19th, 2025]

Executive Summary

The Copilot Workspace rollout to 100 internal go-to-market employees marked a pivotal
milestone this week, delivering immediate validation of our AI-first platform vision while revealing
critical user experience gaps that must be addressed before company-wide deployment. Victor
led this rollout with strong early feedback showing users immediately understood the value
proposition, though quality-of-life improvements in view creation and prompting are essential for
broader adoption success.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Victor's Copilot Workspace internal rollout achieved significant validation with 100 go-to-market
employees, where users consistently recognized the application's value in unifying multiple tools
and providing account prioritization capabilities. The feedback confirmed strong product-market
fit, with leaders like Laser noting this could be "the stickiest application we've ever built at
ZoomInfo" due to its universal appeal across SDRs, AEs, and managers.

Brandon's vertical datasets initiative overcame major blockers by delivering production-ready
Form 5500 data to sales teams and completing comprehensive enablement materials. The
franchise dataset received exceptional validation through March Networks' successful sample
evaluation, while Aflac's insurance POC demonstrated substantial business impact with a
projected six-figure expansion opportunity and immediate recruiting results.

Brahm's GTM Studio workstream advanced multiple fronts simultaneously, achieving 90-95%
completion on ROI Analytics milestones while onboarding 10+ internal users to the Studio Chat
experience. The team successfully released an agentic chat experience for ROI assistance and
completed initial testing on the GTM data model adoption, positioning the platform for
end-of-month cutover and GA preparation.

Goals & Progress
Copilot Workspace: Victor's team successfully deployed to 100 internal users with strong value
recognition, though user experience challenges around view creation and chat prompting
require immediate attention. Rather than proceeding with company-wide rollout, the team will
expand to an additional 100 AE/AM users while implementing quality-of-life improvements
including out-of-the-box views for managers and enhanced chat functionality.

AI Context Service: Adam's PMM narrative development for Dreamforce and broader AI
context positioning is progressing with canonical messaging frameworks taking shape. The work
addresses the need for clear talk tracks across Studio, Copilot, and AI context services, though
coordination with Rowan's technical development and clearer service definitions remain ongoing
priorities.

Vertical Datasets: Brandon's team resolved the primary blocker affecting sales teams by
delivering Form 5500 production data and enablement materials. Strong validation from
franchise samples with March Networks and insurance POC success with Aflac demonstrate
clear market demand, while the team approaches GTM.ai launch readiness with infrastructure
improvements underway.

Strategic Challenges

The Copilot Workspace rollout revealed that while users grasp the product's value immediately,
they struggle with the mechanics of creating effective views and crafting productive prompts.
This represents a broader challenge in AI user experience design where the gap between
understanding value and achieving it creates adoption friction. Victor's team is prioritizing
enhanced out-of-the-box experiences and improved chat guidance to bridge this gap before
broader deployment.

AI Context Service positioning remains fragmented across multiple teams and stakeholders,
creating confusion in both product development and go-to-market messaging. Ali's assessment
highlights the need for clearer service definition, unified ownership models, and better
articulation of what specific problems the context service solves for different user types and use
cases.

Email notification queue challenges threaten to impact partner onboarding and data delivery
capabilities, requiring cross-team coordination between PTI, email delivery teams, and Acton to
resolve ownership ambiguities. Brandon's team has identified a clear remediation path, but the
complexity of multi-vendor coordination poses timing risks for self-serve flywheel partner
launches.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries
The internal Copilot Workspace deployment revealed that product-market fit validation doesn't
automatically translate to user activation success. Users immediately understood the value
proposition but encountered friction in the execution layer, specifically around view creation and
effective prompting. This insight reinforces the need for AI applications to provide stronger
guidance and scaffolding rather than assuming users can immediately leverage advanced
capabilities.

Cross-functional coordination gaps emerged as a significant theme across multiple initiatives,
from partnership integration processes to AI credit implementation. The team's work on
contributory network data ingestion and website key buyer ID requirements revealed systematic
challenges in aligning legal, security, and engineering stakeholders that consume
disproportionate time relative to technical complexity.

AI artifact creation and chat functionality show promise as differentiating user experiences, with
internal teams gravitating toward these capabilities over traditional interface patterns. This
suggests the platform's future direction should emphasize conversational interfaces and
dynamic content generation rather than conventional dashboard approaches.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with the enablement team on Copilot Workspace deployment continues to be essential
for successful field adoption. The team requires more prescriptive guidance on cohort targeting,
training schedules, and messaging frameworks to ensure sales teams can effectively leverage
the platform for Q4 renewals and expansions. Victor and AJ are coordinating closely on demo
preparation and talk track development for the critical September 29th enablement session.

Platform infrastructure dependencies around AI credit implementation, semantic search
scalability, and prompt service architecture affect multiple product initiatives simultaneously.
These foundational elements require coordinated engineering attention to prevent development
bottlenecks across Studio, Copilot, and Context Service workstreams.

Looking Ahead

Next week focuses on expanding Copilot Workspace to an additional 100 users while
implementing user experience improvements based on initial feedback. The team will prioritize
out-of-the-box views for different personas, enhanced chat guidance, and streamlined view
creation processes to improve activation rates before broader company deployment.

The critical path centers on finalizing platform narrative development for Dreamforce positioning
while ensuring demo readiness for the September 29th enablement session. This requires close
coordination between Adam's PMM work, Victor's product development, and AJ's enablement
coordination to deliver cohesive messaging and compelling demonstrations that sales teams
can immediately operationalize.
Strategic priorities include resolving AI Context Service positioning clarity, advancing vertical
datasets toward broader availability, and strengthening the foundation for Q4 renewal and
expansion activities. The team's ability to maintain current development velocity while managing
increasing go-to-market demands will be crucial for achieving year-end objectives and
positioning for 2026 growth initiatives.
