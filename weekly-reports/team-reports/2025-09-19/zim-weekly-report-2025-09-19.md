# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of September 15, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Person-level intent production deployment now delivers 180 million daily
signals to ZoomInfo through Brett Elliot\'s infrastructure work, while
Path Factory partnership resolution enables continued field marketing
lead generation. Forrester Wave demo script preparation progresses with
comprehensive responses completed as the team advances toward flywheel
data partner self-serve deployment through PLG workflow integration.
September domain release deployed successfully while October MCR
preparation begins for AI Page Rank and conversions features.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Brett Elliot completed person-level intent deployment delivering 180
million daily signals to ZoomInfo with monitoring and alerting
infrastructure in place. The Clickagy system processes individual-level
intent data enabling enhanced targeting capabilities while hedge fund
POC deliveries continue flowing through Bobsled with Citadel
confirmation still pending.

Matt Barnes resolved Path Factory identification issues through API
configuration adjustments accounting for Zscaler IP shifting, achieving
partner satisfaction and enabling continued marketing team lead
generation. The September MCR domains release deployed successfully with
necessary hot fixes addressed, positioning Inferno team attention toward
AI Page Rank and conversions projects for October release.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal delivered agent demonstration recordings for both
websites and intent capabilities, receiving feedback from Dominik and
Ryan for iterative improvements. The self-serve flywheel data partners
PRD progresses with Tuesday review scheduled including PLG team and ads
infrastructure coordination.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Infrastructure Development**: Matt Barnes completed website identity
data pipeline development with successful coordination through Andres
Perez and Sanyog Rai for data store mapping. The website identity API
PRD revisions near completion requiring stakeholder and engineering
review, while cross-organizational website visitor journey signal
requirements clarification scheduled for Wednesday with Sneh\'s team.

**Agent Platform Advancement**: Jesse Miller progressed ZIM agent
development through backend-for-frontend endpoint creation and SendGrid
email template completion with four templates ready for Vulcan team
implementation. Agent UI ticket preparation for Michael Kelly
prioritization enables production testing environment setup while
forecasting UI GA feedback from Carlos requires one treatment
adjustment.

**Partnership Ecosystem**: Anwar Mai completed Forrester Wave draft
responses with comprehensive coverage across team capabilities while
coordinating flywheel data partner ELT follow-up and PLG team
integration. Path Factory data taxonomy submission enables Snowflake
ingestion planning while Kaspera partnership introduction advances
contract review and pixel testing phases.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Matt Barnes manages potential resource constraints as Inferno team
attention shifts toward AI Page Rank and conversions projects for
October MCR while maintaining website identity data pipeline delivery
timelines. The cross-organizational website visitor journey signal
requirements need clarification from Sneh\'s team to prevent delays in
Q4 high-profile signal delivery.

Jesse Miller identifies RampID mapping process modifications needed
following Brett Elliot\'s guidance on keeping specific data within
ZoomInfo infrastructure while sending only anonymous RampIDs to Clickagy
systems. This affects DMP API development dependencies and requires COIN
team coordination for FBR pipeline rebuild to maintain legal compliance.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal coordinates prepay automation discovery requiring
better understanding of current SFDC to SAP to Boomi flow processes
before building automation solutions. The September 22nd bot elimination
deployment requires conversion data backfill and reprocessing
coordination with Zai for data quality maintenance.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Anwar Mai\'s coordination revealed that flywheel data partner self-serve
deployment will follow the websites PLG validation workflow, enabling
partner classification and data sharing validation while preventing
company cannibalization. The approach includes self-attestation for
privacy compliance and quarterly scanning through Pravado at \$50K
annual cost for unlimited partner monitoring.

Matt Barnes discovered two primary options for streaming data to GTM
Store through either API Upsert or the Chorus pipeline actively
streaming data to Store. This architectural finding enables flexible
data delivery approaches while the GTM Store team determines optimal
mechanisms for websites identification data integration.

Brett Elliot identified that Sovrn bidding infrastructure lacks RampID
decoding capabilities, requiring LiveRamp and Sovrn coordination to
enable envelope decoding and RampID delivery in bid streams. This
technical gap affects contact targeting optimization requiring both code
modification and infrastructure enhancement for improved bidding
performance.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Sneh\'s team on website visitor journey signals requires
requirements clarification following the Wednesday cross-organizational
walkthrough that identified gaps in specifications. Matt Barnes
coordinates with stakeholders to prevent Q4 signal delivery delays while
ensuring proper data asset delivery to designated platforms.

Partnership development with Path Factory advances through data taxonomy
submission enabling Snowflake ingestion coordination with Lynda while
considering Upsert API alternative for streamlined GTM Datastore
integration. This approach eliminates custom development requirements
while leveraging existing infrastructure capabilities.

Forrester Wave preparation requires continued coordination across sales,
customer experience, product, and engineering teams for revenue
marketing evaluation positioning. The demo script development following
standardized analyst questioning format ensures comprehensive platform
capability representation.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on Forrester demo script completion and October
release preparation, with the team positioned to advance flywheel
partner deployment and maintain production platform excellence.

Anwar Mai leads Forrester demo script development for revenue marketing
evaluation while coordinating website visitor journey signal
requirements with Sneh and Tanvi. Jesse Miller advances ZIM agent
production testing through Michael Kelly UI ticket prioritization while
coordinating COIN team FBR pipeline rebuild discussions. Aadhitthyaa
Hari Gopal progresses GTM Config schema documentation for ZDP team
review while initiating prepay automation discovery and conversion data
backfill coordination.

Matt Barnes focuses on website identity data NRT pipeline advancement
toward end-of-September GTM Store delivery while managing AI Page Rank
and conversions project preparation for October MCR. Brett Elliot
continues hedge fund POC delivery confirmation while coordinating
LiveRamp and Sovrn technical resolution for RampID bidding enhancement.
Shuxin Yang advances ZIM UX priority analysis and intent vendor partner
evaluation following data science team alignment.

The team maintains steady execution momentum with production deployments
advancing and partnership frameworks developing to support platform
expansion and competitive positioning in the revenue marketing
evaluation.
