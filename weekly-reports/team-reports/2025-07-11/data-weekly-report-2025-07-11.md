Data Team Executive Roundup - Monday
July 7th - Friday July 11th

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Brandon Tucker delivered breakthrough identity resolution capabilities with visitor
resolution rates hitting all-time highs and IP2Company resolution jumping 11% through 5x5
integration. FormComplete vs Resolution dashboard is live (team was already on top of it),
providing the monitoring foundation we've desperately needed for quality control as we scale.

Dana Hurtig executed flawless hierarchy cleanup by automatically detecting and correcting
20,000+ orphaned subsidiary companies using description-based automation. The team
realigned processes around Ethan Young's new company definition, with Research leadership
expressing enthusiasm for database-wide rollout. This systematic approach eliminated
significant data quality issues that have plagued customer integrations.

Brandon Wilson achieved full signal generation automation for semantic-data-enhanced
signals, delivering test results to Account Managers for 20 accounts with actual upcoming
renewals. Early AM feedback indicates these signals are substantially more relevant than
previous iterations, representing a major leap forward in signal quality and relevance.

Goals & Progress

Identity Graph Optimization (90% complete): Brandon Tucker's VRS/ID Graph work reached
90% completion with MAID-based identifier integration underway and comprehensive accuracy
testing frameworks established. The FormComplete-based monitoring system is operational,
though row-by-row accuracy analysis and buyer group segmentation remain pending. This
positions us for aggressive coverage expansion with quality controls in place.

Company Definition Implementation (90% complete): Ethan Young's company definition
work landed strongly with Anne's team showing "excitement and eagerness" for database
rollout. Customer validation remains the final gate, with DaaS team coordination needed to
identify initial conversation targets. The definition work has already enabled Dana's hierarchy
cleanup success and should unlock significant database improvements.

Roadmap Consolidation (90% complete): Jody Roberts advanced H2 roadmap planning
despite acknowledging the team is "doing too much." The agentic platform discovery emerged
as a powerful accelerator for delivering 80% solutions faster than traditional development
cycles. New PM onboarding for shared services is underway, though prioritization clarity
remains essential.

Strategic Challenges

Our compliance infrastructure is hostage to cross-functional politics. Rob Priore's
OneTrust banner work achieved 0% completion because marketing leadership unilaterally
extended cookie suppression testing without consulting the data team. This isn't about technical
complexity - it's about marketing making compliance decisions that put the company at
regulatory risk. We've confirmed that website cookie loading issues are reducing lead flow, yet
we're operating in a compliance gray area while marketing runs experiments.

Critical infrastructure systems lack clear ownership and are rotting. The CN Admin Panel
has been broken for months with "disparate ownership and maintenance over time" creating a
situation where "no one has owned the solution." Hannan's team has been identified as the best
engineering owner, but they need explicit prioritization to make progress. This pattern of
infrastructure neglect is creating compound reliability issues across multiple systems.

Our company pipeline is frozen indefinitely, blocking fundamental data operations.
Dana's team cannot add new companies due to pipeline uncertainty, creating a bottleneck that
affects everything downstream. We have "low risk" new company addition options available, but
need engineering and product alignment to proceed. This freeze represents strategic paralysis
rather than technical constraints.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

The lead flow mystery is solved, but the solution is blocked. We definitively traced the 30%
reduction in demo requests to website cookie loading issues - not OneTrust implementation as
originally suspected. Product management in Israel is working on the technical fix, but we're still
operating with suspended compliance controls due to marketing's extended testing. This
represents a 9-month problem that was solvable but got lost in organizational complexity.

Enterprise customers are demanding person-based resolution outside of Co-pilot. Disney
and Workday have expressed strong interest in centralized person-based resolution for scale
activation, not just front-line Co-pilot usage. This represents significant untapped revenue
opportunity if we can deliver API integration for Websights and GTM Studio. The technical
capability exists - we need product prioritization and engineering cycles to unlock the revenue.

Process documentation is solving parallel dataset development chaos. Dow Jones
achieved 100% completion on team operating model implementation, creating clear guidance
for multiple simultaneous dataset development streams. Early contractor cube signals from
GTM show "several demos booked," validating the approach. This suggests our custom dataset
strategy can scale if we maintain process discipline.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with engineering teams on CN Admin Panel ownership has stalled due to prioritization
confusion rather than technical constraints. Hannan's team is identified as the best owner, but
they need explicit executive mandate to take on this infrastructure work. Without clear
prioritization, this critical system will continue degrading while teams avoid ownership
responsibility.

Marketing leadership's unilateral compliance decisions are creating regulatory risk and blocking
data team progress. The cookie banner suppression extension demonstrates a fundamental
misunderstanding of compliance requirements. We need executive clarity on who owns
compliance decisions and how cross-functional experimentation should work without
compromising regulatory protection.

Looking Ahead

Next week's success depends on breaking through organizational gridlock, not technical
challenges. Three issues require immediate executive intervention: (1) Marketing must commit
to compliance timeline restoration, (2) Engineering must assign clear CN Admin Panel
ownership with prioritization, and (3) Product must unfreeze the company pipeline with explicit
go/no-go criteria.

The technical foundation is solid and ready for aggressive scaling. Brandon Tucker's
identity resolution improvements, Dana's hierarchy cleanup success, and Brandon Wilson's
signal automation represent months of foundational work reaching maturity. We have monitoring
systems, quality controls, and automation frameworks in place. The bottleneck is now
organizational alignment and resource allocation rather than technical capability.

Our custom dataset strategy is proving its revenue potential. The contractor cube early
success and strong enterprise interest in person-based resolution suggest we're building the
right capabilities. However, we need faster go-to-market execution and clearer prioritization to
capitalize on these opportunities. The technical delivery is exceeding expectations - the
organizational support needs to match that velocity.
