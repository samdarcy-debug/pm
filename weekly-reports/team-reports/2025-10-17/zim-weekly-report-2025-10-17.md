# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of October 13, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Identity data partner onboarding achieves November 18th production GA
target with November 11th SKU availability, while LiveIntent pixel
analysis shows 0.5 percentage point VRR lift positioning potential 3%
visitor resolution achievement. Enhanced data deletions framework
completed with seven PRDs enabling GDPR compliance roadmap as Vendor
contract signing advances 20-signal limitation requiring intent
integration strategy development. Agent chat UI deploys to production
October 21st while DeltaX campaign management requirements receive
positive partner feedback.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal aligned identity data partner onboarding
timelines across five teams including RevOps, entitlement, marketing
website, PLG, and Privado with November 18th production GA release and
early November staging testing. GTM Config generation succeeded for
three of four beta customers (SurveyMonkey, SupportLogic, Cvent) while
Berlin Packaging site crawling issues require investigation for
offerings generation capabilities.

Brett Elliot completed seven enhanced data deletion PRDs exceeding
original five-PRD target while delivering agent runner PRD enabling
Mehdi\'s development initiation. LiveIntent pixel analysis reveals 0.5
percentage point VRR improvement suggesting potential path to 2.75-3%
visitor resolution while 5x5 pixel and tag implementations show minimal
initial impact requiring extended data collection for trend detection.

Jesse Miller advanced DeltaX campaign management requirements through
detailed PRD and prototype presentation receiving strong partner
enthusiasm for scope clarity. Gabe successfully transitioned
responsibilities to Jenny and Aidan while agent chat UI confirmation for
October 21st production deployment enables testing in ZIM interface
advancing functionality development.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Infrastructure Development**: Matt Barnes progressed FormComplete data
store mapping coordination while advancing AI Page Rank early access
documentation despite development team illness delays. Website visitor
journey signal pipeline expansion incorporates both WebSights and
FormComplete data generation through coordination with OO team workflow
management approach adding flexibility for signal processing.

**Partnership Integration**: Shuxin Yang completed Vendor contract
signing kickoff advancing third-party intent integration despite
20-signal contractual limitation requiring aggregation strategy
development. Intent agent table clarification with Amy enables ALI data
consumption while custom intent team coordination addresses UX
difficulties for retroactive intent deployment.

**Agent Platform**: Jesse Miller completed CloudFlare removal proposal
with expansion testing framework while coordinating DoubleO product lead
discussions for audience activation workflow integration. Agent platform
adoption challenges with Aidan and Vulcan team require learning curve
navigation leveraging cross-team experience for value delivery
acceleration.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal addresses domain data gaps affecting 7-8% of
companies (45,000 of 620,000 evaluated) preventing offerings generation
requiring empty state UI development for customer-provided information.
ZoomInfo company ID appending process lacks clarity requiring Anne
Fajkus and Matthew Williams coordination for tenant onboarding workflow
validation.

Matt Barnes manages Data Store CDC completion timeline uncertainty
affecting GTM Store to Global Event Bus data flow architecture requiring
COIN and Inferno planning clarity. Website visitor journey signal PRD
expansion needed as pipeline scope grows incorporating FormComplete
alongside WebSights data delivery for workflow trigger enablement.

Anwar Mai coordinates website journey data timeline adjustment with Sneh
and Marc Frail pushing January 2026 delivery enabling resource
reallocation while maintaining commitment clarity. Staples first-party
intent surfacing requirements reveal custom signals integration
dependency requiring Shuxin Yang\'s coordination with Linda on ALI data
GTM Store ingestion for millions of daily rows.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Brett Elliot\'s LiveIntent pixel analysis reveals 0.5 percentage point
VRR improvement from current 2.25% baseline suggesting potential 2.75%
achievement while 5x5 implementations require extended monitoring. The
analysis approach validates incremental vendor evaluation methodology
while highlighting diminishing returns requiring strategic assessment
beyond marginal gains.

Matt Barnes discovered OO workflow management connected agents approach
provides tremendous data processing flexibility requiring consideration
in signal pipeline design decisions. The learning suggests additional
knowledge transfer sessions with OO team inform architectural choices
for future data flow implementations.

Shuxin Yang identified Vendor contract limitations restricting 20
signals per customer requiring intent aggregation strategy development
for standard topic utilization. The contractual constraint necessitates
vendor signal creation separate from intent integration enabling future
negotiation leverage while establishing integration patterns for
third-party data partnerships.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Linda on ALI data GTM Store ingestion continues advancing
through table clarification and process collaboration determining
implementation complexity. Shuxin Yang coordinates millions of daily
rows delivery requiring volume management strategy discussion for
scalable data pipeline architecture.

Identity partner onboarding coordination spans five teams requiring
meticulous planning preventing last-minute dependency discoveries.
Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s cross-organizational coordination ensures
November 18th timeline achievement while managing Privado manual
scanning approach for launch version.

Agent development requires Michael Kelly prioritization for UI
deployment while DoubleO integration discussions explore audience
activation workflow opportunities. Jesse Miller coordinates across
platform teams advancing agentic capabilities while managing DeltaX
partnership requirements and CloudFlare infrastructure optimization
proposals.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week emphasizes roadmap alignment and November release preparation
while advancing agent production testing and partnership integration
execution.

Anwar Mai leads ZIM roadmap alignment with Ben (sales) and CX teams
while advancing Q4 and 2026 planning coordination and Gartner MQ
preparation. Jesse Miller progresses DeltaX campaign management PRD
development and Q4 project documentation while initiating VRS is_bot
flag person-level logic enhancement. Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal focuses on
November release end-to-end testing across custom reporting, conversion
tracking, and identity partner onboarding while advancing account AI
toward November 14th target and offerings scaling to 1M companies.

Matt Barnes completes website visitor journey signal PRD expansion
incorporating FormComplete data generation while advancing AI Page Rank
early access launch and Q4 planning finalization. Brett Elliot analyzes
extended LiveIntent and 5x5 data determining optimal vendor integration
continuation while completing privacy cluster monitoring. Shuxin Yang
creates organizational awareness of workbooks integration gaps while
advancing per-page UX investigation and intent quality prioritization
discussions with Carlos.

The team maintains execution momentum while navigating resource
constraints requiring strategic prioritization balancing November
release commitments against Q4 roadmap adjustments and agentic platform
investment coordination.
