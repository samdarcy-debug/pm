# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of November 3, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

November 18th release preparation completed with AI Page Rank and bot
filtering documentation, videos, and implementation guides finished
while website identity pipeline returns to production with ZI data
filtering. Adobe \$8-10M revenue gap requires closure through enhanced
ad spend and two-year renewal coordination as team navigates website
journey data specification misunderstandings from multiple consuming
teams. DMP activation planning advances with tomorrow\'s review meeting
while workbooks row limitations identified as blocker requiring 400K
capacity doubling.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Matt Barnes completed comprehensive November 18th release preparation
including AI Page Rank and bot filtering video creation, how-to guides,
feature packs, and website implementation guide revisions. Website
identity pipeline successfully returned to production with ZI data
filtering enabling controlled expansion toward Q4 work incorporating
FormComplete data and additional attributes supporting December or
January GTM Plays deployment.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal finalized GTM Config migration plan for existing
customer transitions with proposal under stakeholder review, while
completing identity data partner onboarding documentation for onboarding
team handoff post-November 18th release. Competitive offerings QA
kickoff with Brandon Tucker\'s data research team initiates validation
process for knowledge graph generation supporting offerings dataset
quality.

Jesse Miller advanced DMP activation planning with comprehensive
documentation prepared for tomorrow\'s review meeting following
extensive UI investigation identifying workbooks row limitations as
activation blocker. Meta campaign management discovery progresses
alongside DeltaX API endpoint development targeting November 26th
delivery for Richard\'s team integration.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Agent Infrastructure**: Brett Elliot coordinates web search agent
Temporal migration across five international teams through daily
stand-ups and dedicated Slack channel communication. The migration
testing awaits staging environment validation with production deployment
targeting Monday following PR merge delays, while emailer agent
migration preparation leverages established team coordination patterns.

**Partnership Execution**: Anwar Mai supports Adobe data deletion
requirements for RTCDP integration while coordinating two-year renewal
preservation addressing Chorus churn concerns. The revenue gap of
\$8-10M requires Adobe ad spend expansion alongside additional
partnership development for 7x7 revenue target achievement.

**Platform Integration**: Shuxin Yang captured comprehensive intent data
use cases for GTM Store integration while identifying per-tenant
duplication architecture inefficiency requiring Linda\'s engineering
coordination. ZIM UX wins advancement through Tomer\'s amplitude event
analysis enables LLM-powered suggestion generation while intent agent
coordination with Troy addresses Amy\'s December ETA for ClickHouse data
refresh affecting agent development timelines.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Anwar Mai addresses website journey data specification coordination as
multiple teams (Sneh, Jagin, Victor, Sean) establish dates and
requirements without consultation causing misunderstanding and
eleventh-hour requirement discoveries. The Monday coordination session
with Sean and Matt aims to establish proactive specification and
timeline communication preventing reactive coordination patterns.

Jesse Miller manages workbooks row limitation blockers affecting
customer export requirements proposing capacity doubling to 400K or
preview approach displaying subset while sending full lists to LiveRamp.
DeltaX API endpoint development delays push integration delivery to
November 26th while agent platform issues consumed day-and-a-half
development time affecting Troy\'s implementation progress.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal coordinates engineering blog requirements for
offerings and competitive offerings knowledge graph documentation while
managing multi-team dependencies requiring meticulous planning
preventing last-minute additional work. The migration plan approval
remains pending affecting future design work commencement and
stakeholder alignment clarity.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Anwar Mai\'s coordination revealed need for platform team education on
advertising capabilities beyond core ZIM team knowledge requiring office
hours or video content development. The B2C campaign value for intent
and identity derivation requires Ali\'s understanding as large-funnel
approach enables lower-funnel identity resolution supporting platform
intelligence goals.

Jesse Miller discovered workbooks row limitations create substantial
activation constraints requiring architectural discussions about
capacity expansion versus preview-based workarounds. The API wrapper
development coordination with DeltaX highlights partnership timeline
dependencies requiring buffer planning for external vendor deliverables.

Matt Barnes validated Mark Frail\'s workflow webhook capabilities exist
but lack production usage history creating uncertainty about real-world
performance. The Monday webhook strategy decision with Brandon
determines architectural approach balancing rapid deployment through
existing infrastructure against dedicated API service long-term
flexibility.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Linda on intent data GTM Store architecture requires
efficiency strategy development addressing per-tenant duplication
creating billions of daily rows. Shuxin Yang coordinates engineering
collaboration determining optimal data organization approach balancing
access control requirements against storage optimization.

Partnership advancement with Adobe requires data deletion support for
RTCDP while coordinating sample file delivery through Ryan Smith, Hannah
approval process, and Becky\'s requirements. The two-year renewal
preservation necessitates Chorus churn resolution and enhanced ad spend
commitment coordination across sales, partnerships, and product teams.

Agent platform coordination spans five international teams for web
search agent Temporal migration requiring daily stand-up communication
and PR review coordination. Brett Elliot manages distributed team
synchronization preventing timezone delays while establishing migration
patterns for subsequent emailer agent transition.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week emphasizes revenue gap closure strategy and team
reorganization finalization while advancing November 18th release
coordination and partnership integration execution.

Anwar Mai coordinates ZIM team meeting with sales and CX presenting past
performance and roadmap overview per Dators\' request while finalizing
reorganization structure. Adobe \$8-10M revenue gap closure requires
strategic planning alongside Q4 ad spend promotional follow-up and
platform education initiative development. Jesse Miller leads DMP
activation review meeting advancing LiveRamp integration planning while
progressing LinkedIn campaign management and Meta discovery with agent
platform advancement.

Matt Barnes completes website identity webhook approach decision Monday
enabling Q4 expansion work for FormComplete integration and additional
attribute delivery. Website journey pipeline expansion incorporates
session management complexity supporting GTM Plays December-January
timeline while maintaining November 18th release quality. Aadhitthyaa
Hari Gopal advances competitive offerings QA coordination and
engineering blog documentation while finalizing GTM Config migration
plan stakeholder alignment.

Brett Elliot completes web search agent Temporal migration staging
testing and production deployment targeting Monday while initiating
emailer agent migration leveraging established cross-team coordination
patterns. Shuxin Yang coordinates ALI GTM Store architecture planning
with Linda determining efficient data organization approach while
advancing ZIM UX quick wins ticketing for Tomer\'s available capacity
utilization.

The team maintains execution momentum approaching \$15M annual goal
requiring strong November-December performance while coordinating
multi-team dependencies and addressing architectural scalability
challenges across agent infrastructure and data pipeline development.
