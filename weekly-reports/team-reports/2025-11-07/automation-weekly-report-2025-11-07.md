# **Automation Executive Roundup - 11/7/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**Connector publishing achieves production readiness and function
nesting complexity emerges for GTM Plays.** Marc Frail completed
end-to-end testing of connector publishing flow with production
promotion scheduled for Monday morning, following resolution of
cross-timezone coordination challenges. Adam Peretz secured leadership
approval for API versioning proposal and continues Salesforce
partnership negotiations. Sam Massie handed off internal connector
requirements to engineering but identified that function nesting will be
essential for complex GTM Plays scenarios.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Marc Frail achieved production readiness for connector publishing**,
resolving all blocking issues through coordinated cross-team
synchronization and completing end-to-end testing. The work is scheduled
for Monday morning production promotion, enabling the 22-connector
library to become available as enrichment options supporting GTM Studio
GA.

**Adam Peretz secured API versioning approval and advanced Salesforce
partnership discussions**, completing leadership review with Ali and
continuing alignment conversations with Salesforce to ensure mutual
understanding of agent requirements. Once requirements alignment is
achieved, technical scoping for solution delivery can begin.

**Sam Massie completed internal connector handoff to engineering**,
defining flows for surfacing ZoomInfo internal APIs as data connectors
in Plays, Workflows, and Workbooks. The work includes integration
engineering requirements synchronization and Cline prototype epic
preparation, enabling ZoomInfo\'s own apps and APIs to become executable
steps across the platform.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Connector Publishing Launch**: Marc Frail resolved publishing flow
issues and completed end-to-end testing, with production deployment
scheduled for Monday. The resolution required synchronous collaboration
across three teams in different time zones after asynchronous ping-pong
proved ineffective.

**API Versioning Framework**: Adam Peretz completed both weekly goals
with leadership approval of versioning proposal and continued Salesforce
partnership requirement alignment. Implementation will proceed through
combined technical requirements and documentation shared with wider
teams.

**Internal API Integration**: Sam Massie completed definition of flows
for adding ZoomInfo internal APIs as data connectors, enabling core
platform capabilities to be surfaced as executable steps in any ZoomInfo
application including GTM Plays.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Function nesting complexity emerges for GTM Plays requirements**, as
Sam Massie identified that some Plays functions will get very complex,
requiring function nesting capabilities while maintaining simple API
action patterns with clear inputs and outputs. This architectural
challenge affects how composable automation capabilities can be.

**Salesforce partnership balances opportunity against data exposure
risk**, as Adam Peretz noted that while the partnership could drive
significant business, it represents potential data exposure risk
requiring careful legal terms to mitigate. The partnership\'s success
depends on finding terms that enable the business opportunity while
managing security concerns.

**Asynchronous coordination proves insufficient for complex technical
issues**, with Marc Frail discovering that publishing flow problems
couldn\'t be resolved through back-and-forth communication, requiring
all parties in a room together for effective problem-solving across
timezone boundaries.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Synchronous collaboration accelerates complex problem resolution**, as
Marc Frail learned that technical issues involving multiple teams and
timezones resolve much faster through real-time collaboration than
through asynchronous ping-pong communication. This operational insight
affects how cross-team technical challenges should be approached.

**Function composability requires architectural balance**, as Sam
Massie\'s discovery about function nesting reveals tension between
enabling complex automation scenarios and maintaining simple API
patterns. The challenge is allowing recursive function calls while
preserving clear input/output interfaces.

**API versioning approval enables accumulated improvements**, with
leadership endorsement allowing implementation of the
Legacy/Stable/Preview endpoint versioning approach that addresses
longstanding customer and engineering team frustrations around API
evolution.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Cross-timezone coordination with Andres\'s team and others was essential
for resolving connector publishing issues, with the experience
highlighting the importance of real-time collaboration for complex
technical problem-solving.

Integration engineering coordination continues for Sam Massie\'s
internal connector work, ensuring that ZoomInfo APIs can be properly
surfaced across platform applications with appropriate abstraction
layers.

Salesforce partnership requires continued cross-functional alignment to
ensure mutual understanding of agent requirements before technical
scoping can proceed effectively.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on workflows charter evolution while advancing
Salesforce partnership planning and GTM Plays function requirements
refinement.

Adam Peretz will split priority between Salesforce agentic prospecting
integration next steps and data management processes to provide ZI Chat
with access to analytical data about customer consumption via API,
addressing both strategic partnership and internal analytics
infrastructure needs.

Sam Massie will work with engineering to refine function requirements
supporting GTM Plays launch, addressing the nesting complexity while
maintaining simple API action patterns that enable sophisticated
automation scenarios.

The convergence of production-ready connector publishing, approved API
versioning frameworks, and advancing Salesforce partnership creates
momentum toward significant platform expansion, while analytics
infrastructure transition and function architecture complexity require
careful navigation of technical and strategic challenges.
