# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of September 22, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Bot filtering beta launched with six customers enabled while hedge fund
POC delivers 20,000 daily topics from 3.5 million page views,
establishing data delivery capabilities for high-value financial
services accounts. DeltaX migration reaches 60-70% completion enabling
October contract termination with Adverity, while Adobe onsite
engagement advances ZoomInfo as source requirements gathering for 2026
integration planning. Team navigates resource constraints and access
issues while maintaining forward momentum on October release
preparation.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Matt Barnes launched automated traffic filtering beta with six customers
enabled and additional prospects identified through CX team outreach.
The bot filtering solution addresses customer noise complaints while UX
improvements clarify automated traffic versus company traffic
distinctions based on initial user feedback requesting better interface
explanations.

Brett Elliot completed hedge fund POC delivery generating 20,000 daily
topics from 3.5 million observed page views on target accounts.
Person-level intent deployment continues processing 180 million daily
signals to ZoomInfo while privacy cluster VRS integration testing
identifies implementation approach for next week rollout.

Jesse Miller achieved substantial DeltaX migration progress with 60-70%
of customers successfully transitioned from Adverity, positioning for
30-day contract termination notice delivery next week. Agent UI ticket
pickup by Michael Kelly enables staging environment testing while
notification center email template creation supports production
deployment coordination.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Platform Infrastructure**: Matt Barnes progressed website identity
data pipeline development despite early-week access issues, with
Inferno\'s embedded IE team resolution enabling continued advancement.
Conversions testing completed successfully with Monday production
deployment scheduled while AI Page Rank preparation advances for October
7th early access launch.

**Agent Development**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal completed agent
demonstration coordination with feedback integration from Dominik and
Ryan while advancing GTM Config agent evaluation finalization with
Tingting. Agent platform entitlement capabilities discovered enabling
user-specific agent access control based on platform permissions.

**Data Integration**: Shuxin Yang completed workbooks integration gap
analysis revealing 200,000 record limitations affecting audience builder
transition requirements. User journey investigation through amplitude
events requires page-level analysis approach due to event naming
challenges while data science resource constraints may affect intent
development timelines.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Matt Barnes coordinates IE team access resolution following backlog
issues that initially blocked website identity pipeline progress, now
addressed through Inferno\'s embedded team coordination. Sanyog\'s team
attribute delivery timeline uncertainty affects GTM Store engagement
schema completion requiring Monday or Tuesday delivery confirmation for
data pipeline advancement.

Jesse Miller manages DeltaX endpoint documentation inconsistencies
causing migration delays for remaining sensitive customer accounts
requiring CDM approval coordination. Forecasting UI feedback from Carlos
identifies information redundancy requiring treatment adjustment while
CloudFlare tag analysis reveals 13% drop rate compared to 1% for direct
endpoint access.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal addresses Consensus prospect data analysis delays
affecting multi-product deal closure while coordinating October release
preparation across five staggered deployment dates. GTM Config schema
coordination with Sanyog and Linda requires scheduling advancement for
datastore ingestion planning. Also working through getting account
briefs available to the GTM Config agent.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Matt Barnes discovered GTM Data Store Upsert API offers both
asynchronous and synchronous modes, with asynchronous processing
requiring 50-60 minute queuing during high-volume periods. This finding
affects near real-time pipeline architecture decisions requiring volume
management or synchronous mode selection for optimal performance.

Jesse Miller\'s ZI tag analysis revealed significant performance
differences with CloudFlare integration showing 13% drop rates compared
to 1% for direct endpoint access. This technical validation supports
infrastructure optimization discussions while providing evidence for
Carlos to present to Henry regarding tag delivery architecture
improvements.

Shuxin Yang identified workbooks limitations including 200,000 record
constraints affecting audience builder migration planning while noting
functionality gaps requiring feature parity assessment. The
investigation reveals workbooks shares ZIM codebase enabling UI
integration opportunities despite capacity restrictions requiring
organizational coordination.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Sanyog\'s team on engagement attribute delivery continues
to be essential for website identity pipeline completion, with Monday or
Tuesday timeline confirmation needed for GTM Store data integration
advancement.

Partnership coordination with Path Factory advances through demo data
evaluation for ingestion planning via either Upsert API or Snowflake
delivery methods. Adobe partnership development continues through onsite
B2B event coordination while advancing ZoomInfo as source requirements
gathering for platform integration.

Agent development coordination with Michael Kelly and Vulcan team
enables production testing environment preparation while notification
center email implementation requires DOZI 16 documentation updates for
streamlined engineering execution.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week emphasizes October release preparation and partnership
advancement while addressing infrastructure dependencies and resource
coordination challenges.

Anwar Mai coordinates Adobe source requirements gathering through onsite
engagement while advancing GTM Config timeline clarification and website
buyer journey attribute specifications. Jesse Miller leads agent
demonstration preparation for Friday while completing Adverity contract
termination coordination and ZI tag analysis dashboard development.
Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal progresses October release package preparation
across five deployment dates while advancing GTM Config schema
finalization with ZDP team coordination.

Matt Barnes focuses on website identity data pipeline completion through
Sanyog attribute delivery coordination while advancing AI Page Rank
early access preparation and conversions production deployment. Brett
Elliot completes privacy cluster VRS integration while maintaining hedge
fund POC delivery monitoring. Shuxin Yang creates organizational
awareness of workbooks integration gaps while advancing page-level UX
investigation and data science resource coordination for intent
development.

The team maintains execution momentum despite resource constraints and
technical dependencies, with October releases advancing and partnership
frameworks developing to support continued platform capabilities
expansion.
