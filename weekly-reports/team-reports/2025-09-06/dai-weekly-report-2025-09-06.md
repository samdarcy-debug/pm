DAI Executive Roundup - September 2nd -
September 5th, 2025

Executive Summary

AI credit pricing system is dev-ready and launched with full requirements locked down,
representing our most critical revenue infrastructure milestone this quarter. Adam Smith and Ali
Sadat's teams achieved alignment across Frank Shaw, Michael, and Mark Harris on technical
architecture, unblocking the 4-week sprint to production. However, Unified Profile delivery is
delayed until post-October due to engineering resource constraints, as the data
processing team remains pulled into Studio pipeline work. This impacts our ability to deliver the
unified golden record that customers expect when consolidating data. Victor Oliveros has
Copilot V2 internal rollout beginning with refined first-time user experience focused on
immediate value delivery.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

AI Credit System Breakthrough: Adam Smith and Ali Sadat delivered complete technical
requirements and architectural alignment for the AI credit pricing system. Brannon on Ali's team
achieved dev-ready status with Frank Shaw and Michael aligned on engineering approach.
Development has officially started with a 4-week timeline to production, removing the primary
technical blocker for our AI monetization strategy.

Copilot V2 Internal Rollout Initiated: Victor Oliveros launched the cross-functional internal
rollout with 20 employees enabled and a structured war room approach involving RNG, new
business, rev ops, and marketing teams. The focus has shifted to pre-canned prompts and
persona-specific artifacts that deliver immediate value without requiring user training, directly
addressing adoption concerns from sales leadership.

GTM Studio Talk Track Finalization: AJ Belen achieved 98% completion on the go-to-market
Studio talk track with final feedback pending from Lou Laser and Molly. The AI context service
talk track shows significant progress with Rowan's active involvement, creating the foundation
for unified positioning across our AI asset portfolio.

Goals & Progress
AI Infrastructure & Monetization: Technical architecture for AI credits is complete and in
development. Adam Smith navigated complex stakeholder alignment across finance, legal, and
go-to-market requirements while maintaining engineering focus. The surprising challenge came
from Michael's scalability concerns, requiring Frank Shaw's intervention to maintain momentum.
Credit allocation discussions with Mark Harris continue but don't impact core technical delivery.

Product Portfolio Alignment: AJ Belen made substantial progress on unified positioning
across Copilot V2, GTM Studio, and AI Context Service. Talk tracks are nearing completion with
clear milestone visibility for GTM teams. The gap identified is comprehensive enablement
coordination across vertical datasets, requiring more structured milestone mapping with sales
leadership beyond current Copilot V2 clarity.

GTM Studio & Data Pipeline Evolution: Ali Sadat advanced datasets from "Yeen"
(yellow-green) toward green status with promising trajectory. Adobe partnership discussions
revealed their agentic platform is nascent with integration possibilities toward end of year/Q1.
Salesforce is drafting MOU with next meeting scheduled for week of 9/22, showing concrete
partnership momentum.

Strategic Challenges

Engineering Resource Allocation Crisis: The data processing team originally assigned to
Unified Profile has been completely absorbed by Studio pipeline work, creating a critical staffing
bottleneck. Ali Sadat reports zero engineers available for Unified Profile until post-October,
despite this being identified as essential for customer value proposition. This exemplifies
broader resource allocation challenges where new product development pulls teams from
foundational infrastructure work.

Sales Enablement Misalignment: Victor Oliveros and AJ Belen identified significant
disconnects between sales leadership conversations and what's filtering to AR and Gabe's
teams. Sales leaders express concerns about platform transitions despite Copilot V2 being
positioned as enhancements rather than wholesale changes. This suggests communication
gaps that could undermine rollout success if not addressed through direct leadership alignment.

Complex Partnership Integration Timelines: Adobe's agentic capabilities are more limited
than anticipated, with their platform being "super, super new" and highly specific rather than
general-purpose. The integration timeline shifted to end of year/early Q1, requiring us to build
underlying data pipelines regardless. This pattern of longer-than-expected partner readiness
timelines may impact our broader ecosystem strategy.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries
GTM Studio Backend Limitations Exposed: Adam Smith's hour-long technical deep-dive with
Michael revealed Studio's backend is "very inflexible" in processing approaches. This discovery
emerged through the pricing requirements integration process and signals broader technical
debt that could constrain future Studio capabilities. Teams should account for significant
complexity when planning any Studio integrations rather than assuming straightforward
implementation.

AI Credit System Complexity Validates Architecture Investment: The pricing system
revealed intricate stakeholder requirements across finance tracking, legal phrasing, and
go-to-market structuring that justify the comprehensive architectural approach. Adam Smith and
Frank Shaw's macro-system view proved essential for navigating competing local requirements.
The surprising technical pushback from Michael demonstrates how scalability concerns can
emerge late in development cycles.

Sales Leadership Confidence Requires Hands-On Experience: Victor Oliveros identified that
sales leaders remain "cautiously optimistic" about Copilot V2 until they personally use the
system. This insight drives the pre-canned prompt and immediate value delivery strategy,
recognizing that adoption depends more on instant gratification than comprehensive training.
The shift to 50-person initial cohort reflects this learning about controlled confidence-building.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with Adobe on agentic integration continues to be critical for marketing use case
expansion, though their nascent platform requires building data pipelines independently of their
tool readiness. Ali Sadat is coordinating the dual-path approach where we develop underlying
bulk data transfer capabilities while preparing for eventual agentic integration once their A2A
approach matures.

Partnership momentum with Salesforce shows concrete progress through MOU drafting, with
Katie Landaal driving LOI development and next engagement scheduled for 9/22. The technical
requirements alignment between our MCP approach and their beta readiness creates a clear
integration pathway that could accelerate mutual platform value.

Looking Ahead

Next week's primary focus centers on enablement execution and technical delivery
milestones, with particular emphasis on translating technical achievements into market-ready
capabilities.

Critical priorities include finalizing GTM Studio and AI Context Service talk tracks to
enable field deployment, advancing the 4-week AI credit system development sprint, and
scaling Copilot V2 internal rollout with persona-specific configurations. Success metrics
center on sales team confidence building through hands-on experience rather than theoretical
training. The Adobe partnership strategy requires alignment between sales and partner teams
on reseller propositions while maintaining focus on data feedback loops across all partnerships.

We're positioned to demonstrate significant market traction by mid-September if current
technical momentum sustains and enablement alignment resolves quickly. The
convergence of technical infrastructure completion, refined positioning assets, and partnership
pipeline creates conditions for accelerated customer value delivery, provided engineering
resource constraints don't expand beyond Unified Profile delays.
