# **Product Ops Executive Roundup - September 2, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Overall progress made across initiatives but limited clear deliverables
achieved this week. Brett Jacobs completed Copilot V2 talk tracks and
Q&A with Dominic and Victor approval and converted materials into
account-specific agents. Next step is tastemaker loop and new business
talk track. Kristin Gandini investigated ongoing CX visibility pain
points around which customers have beta releases, finding LaunchDarkly
data tables deprecated since June, forcing API workarounds for a problem
that\'s been hampering support operations. Daniel Kong\'s implementation
guide automation received positive PM testing feedback; next week
pushing it another step forward on how to deliver these AI-first,
working with [[Mary
Iapicca]{.underline}](mailto:mary.iapicca@zoominfo.com)'s team

**This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Copilot V2 Positioning Materials Advanced**: Brett Jacobs delivered
Copilot V2 talk tracks and Q&A documentation with Dominic and Victor
approval, then converted materials into account-customized agents with
minor tweaks remaining. Sean completed Q&A review, establishing
foundation for launch support. However, materials still require
tastemaker validation loops and new business talk track development to
address the different messaging needs between customer expansions and
net-new prospects.

**Beta Visibility Infrastructure Investigation**: Kristin Gandini
tackled the ongoing CX pain point around visibility into which customers
are impacted by beta and phased releases. Her investigation revealed
LaunchDarkly Snowflake tables were deprecated in June without
replacement, eliminating existing data pathways and forcing API-based
solutions. Mary\'s team continues to experience support challenges from
this operational blind spot as beta release strategies expand.

**Implementation Guide Automation Tested**: Daniel Kong\'s AI-powered
scanner for refreshing implementation guides based on LRT tickets
received positive feedback from PM testing, with Matt Barnes confirming
functionality. The tool showed some marketing-focus bias, which was
expected given limited implementation guide writing standards. Work
continues on screenshot registry development and customer onboarding
team collaboration to understand usage patterns.

### **Goals & Progress**

**H2T1 Initiative Coordination**: Caleb Munson encountered engagement
barriers when mapping H2T1 milestones and dependencies across DAI teams.
His template-based approach via Slack received no responses, complicated
by unplanned leadership off-site activities that pulled stakeholders
away from planning discussions. Recovery efforts focus on individual
outreach to available team members.

**Beta Release Visibility Solution Development**: Kristin Gandini made
50% progress on her plan to address CX visibility issues into beta
customer impacts. LaunchDarkly API investigation proved more complex
than expected, with connection errors requiring Guy\'s team
consultation. The deprecated Snowflake integration discovery explains
why existing visibility approaches have been insufficient for CX
operational needs.

**Customer Impact Analysis**: Daniel Kong\'s implementation guide work
expanded beyond automation toward understanding actual usage patterns
through customer onboarding team collaboration. Upcoming discussion with
Beth Brunner aims to identify pain points in customer journey and
determine where automation provides genuine value versus process
optimization.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Launch Support Coverage Gaps**: Copilot V2 launch preparation faces
timing pressure with required tastemaker validation cycles and new
business talk track development, while covering Lauren\'s maternity
leave responsibilities. The different messaging requirements between
upgrade-focused and new-customer positioning adds complexity to launch
readiness timeline.

**Beta Release Operational Infrastructure**: The longstanding CX
challenge of identifying which customers have beta access lacks reliable
data infrastructure following LaunchDarkly Snowflake deprecation.
API-based solutions require additional development work, while the
operational impact on support quality continues as beta strategies
expand across product teams.

**Cross-Functional Planning Coordination**: Senior DAI engagement on
H2T1 initiative mapping proved difficult due to competing priorities and
stretched capacity. Current approach of template-based information
gathering may need restructuring to accommodate leadership availability
constraints.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Data Pipeline Deprecation Risk**: The LaunchDarkly Snowflake
integration deprecation in June without notification reveals
vulnerability in operational data dependencies. This pattern suggests
need for monitoring third-party data pipeline health and establishing
replacement workflows before deprecation impacts ongoing operations.

**Implementation Guide Value Chain Complexity**: Daniel\'s expanded
investigation into customer onboarding processes shows implementation
guides serve multiple use cases from self-service PDF distribution to
white-glove services. Understanding this ecosystem is essential for
determining where automation provides genuine customer value versus
internal efficiency gains.

**Product Launch Messaging Differentiation**: Brett\'s Copilot V2 work
highlighted the distinct messaging requirements between renewal/growth
scenarios and new customer acquisition, particularly for products with
existing market presence. New business positioning must address full
product value proposition rather than incremental feature benefits.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Mary\'s CX team collaboration on beta visibility challenges provides
essential operational context for solution requirements, while their
continued support difficulties underscore the urgency of establishing
reliable customer impact data. The team\'s direct experience with
support blind spots guides LaunchDarkly API solution development
priorities.

Brett\'s Copilot V2 materials require tastemaker validation coordination
while Daniel\'s implementation guide strategy depends on customer
onboarding team insights to determine automation value and deployment
approach.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on closing launch preparation gaps while advancing
operational visibility solutions and knowledge management capabilities.

**Copilot V2 Launch Preparation**: Brett continues tastemaker validation
loops and new business talk track development, maintaining product
launch readiness while managing Lauren\'s coverage responsibilities.
Success requires balancing iteration cycles with launch timeline
requirements and ensuring messaging differentiation addresses distinct
customer scenarios.

**Beta Visibility Solution Development**: Kristin collaborates with Guy
on LaunchDarkly API approaches while advancing product knowledge base V1
work independent of hackathon outcomes. The dual approach addresses
immediate CX operational needs while building systematic knowledge
management foundations for future beta release strategies.

**Implementation Guide Strategy Clarification**: Daniel\'s customer
onboarding team discussion will inform implementation guide automation
expansion decisions and determine value-driven deployment priorities.
His screenshot registry completion for Andres provides immediate
deliverable while broader strategy questions resolve through usage
pattern analysis.

The team demonstrates progress across complex initiatives while
navigating coverage gaps and infrastructure dependencies that require
continued cross-functional coordination.
