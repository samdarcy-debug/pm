DAI Executive Roundup - August
25th-29th, 2025

Executive Summary

Critical Action Required: We need unified executive messaging and campaign orchestration
across our four major H2 initiatives by September 2nd to avoid enablement chaos and missed
revenue targets. The September 25th launch timeline has zero buffer, with AI credit
implementation racing against customer expectations. Sneh Kakileti reports strong Studio
momentum with 13 customers ramping to 30, but Victor Oliveros has identified a fundamental
flaw: Copilot V2's value is buried behind advanced prompts when sales leaders demanded
zero-admin, instant-value experiences for renewal success.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Salesforce Partnership Breakthrough: Ali Sadat secured follow-up meetings with Chris
Billmeyer, EVP of Sales Cloud, after successful initial discussions about tightly integrating ZI
data into Salesforce CRM. They're drafting a letter of intent and planning design sessions,
representing a potential paradigm shift from vendor to embedded partner across their Sales
Cloud platform.

Studio Customer Validation: Sneh Kakileti has 13 customers actively using Studio with strong
trajectory toward 30 by month-end. Customer feedback reveals critical insights - they're
successfully building AI-driven assets but struggling with seller activation workflows,
emphasizing why Copilot integration and AI Emailer become essential for Q4 success.

Contributory Network Infrastructure: Brandon Tucker delivered a working CN knowledge
base agent and completed foundational data processing for Restaurant, Contractor, and
Franchise datasets. The $10M+ vertical data opportunity now has concrete delivery
mechanisms with customers already receiving contractor cube data.

Goals & Progress

Go-to-Market Alignment: Victor Oliveros is finalizing the 90-day Copilot V2 rollout plan with
sales-shareable documentation by Wednesday. However, internal roadshows revealed that
sales leaders want zero-configuration, immediate-value experiences rather than feature-rich
platforms requiring training and setup.
Technical Architecture Clarity: Adam Smith is mapping the complete inference pipeline from
model vendors to end users, identifying credit utilization tracking, service owners, and
bottlenecks. This addresses background anxiety about production readiness as multiple AI
services come online simultaneously.

PMM Engine Scaling: AJ Belen achieved 80% progress on unified enablement planning across
Copilot V2, GTM Studio, AI Context Layer, and Vertical Datasets. The team identified that
enablement success requires prescriptive milestone-based approaches rather than traditional
feature-by-feature rollouts.

Strategic Challenges

Copilot V2 Value Discovery Problem: Victor's roadshows exposed a critical flaw - despite
tremendous underlying value, users must dig through advanced prompts to find benefits. Sales
leaders explicitly stated that admin-light, instant-value experiences are the primary differentiator
for renewals, directly contradicting current product direction.

Campaign Orchestration Crisis: Multiple teams are operating independently on
interconnected initiatives, creating mixed messaging risks. AJ Belen and Sneh Kakileti identified
that enablement was planning Studio-only approaches when success requires coordinated
narrative across all four H2 initiatives.

AI Credit Implementation Buffer: Sneh flagged that AI credit technical implementation
timelines end September with minimal buffer before launch expectations. This creates risk that
pricing and consumption tracking won't be ready when customers expect to purchase new AI
capabilities.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

Human-in-the-Loop Reality: David Chon's design research revealed that even "fully
automated" AI plays require human checkpoints for quality control and parameter adjustments.
The team needs to design for the spectrum from high human input to full automation rather than
pursuing black-box automation that customers won't trust or adopt.

Seller Activation Gap: Studio customers are building valuable AI assets but lack best practices
for getting recommendations, talking points, and call scripts to their sellers. This isn't just a
technical capability gap - customers need guidance on workflow integration, creating
opportunities for our enablement and professional services teams.

Conservative Engineering Tension: David highlighted ongoing challenges where engineering
partners default to safe, familiar solutions versus pushing innovation boundaries. This creates a
fundamental tension between breakthrough AI-native experiences and reliable, proven
approaches that may limit competitive differentiation.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with Salesforce on deeper CRM integration continues building momentum beyond
current partnership scope. Ali Sadat's discussions with Victor Liu on Sales Cloud product
integration represent potential expansion from data provider to platform capability embedded in
their core workflows.

The September Studio launch depends heavily on integrations and connectors team capacity
for customer exports and activations. Sneh identified this as a scaling bottleneck that could limit
customer growth even with strong product-market fit validation from early adopters.

Looking Ahead

Unified Campaign Launch: The highest priority is creating cohesive messaging and rollout
strategy across Copilot V2, GTM Studio, AI Context Service, and Vertical Datasets before
September enablement kicks off. This requires executive alignment on target accounts, success
metrics, and coordinated positioning rather than four independent product launches.

Adam Smith's inference architecture documentation will address production readiness concerns
and clarify credit utilization patterns across our AI services. Meanwhile, Victor focuses on
solving the Copilot V2 value discovery problem through instant-access features and guided
experiences that demonstrate benefits without requiring user sophistication.

The team must balance innovation ambition with execution reliability as we approach
customer-facing launches. David's insights about human-in-the-loop requirements and
engineering conservatism suggest we need clear product philosophy decisions about
automation levels and technical risk tolerance before development acceleration.
