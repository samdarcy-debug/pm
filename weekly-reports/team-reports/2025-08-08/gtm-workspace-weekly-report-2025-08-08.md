SalesOS/Copilot Executive Roundup -
[August 4th - August 7th, 2025]

Executive Summary

Bottom Line: We're strategically shifting from incremental feature releases to comprehensive
"wow moments" that will define Copilot v2's market position, with Victor leading an Aha moment
tiger team to ensure our September launch creates genuine competitive differentiation rather
than another feature update.

The team is making solid progress across multiple fronts - Adam has completed onboarding flow
alignment with Whitney for Copilot v2, Gabe is launching internal beta testing for MEDDPICC
extraction with Rev Ops, and David is 90% complete on Admin Defined Territories with only
testing remaining. However, we're confronting a critical strategic decision: whether to ship
incremental improvements in phases or invest 3-5 months in building the right solution from day
one, recognizing that historically we never return to upgrade version 1.5 products to version 3.0.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Copilot v2 Onboarding Breakthrough: Adam completed the final onboarding flow walkthrough
with Whitney, successfully integrating his Aha moment framework with Ryan's evolving Copilot
v2 design in Figma. This represents a major milestone in ensuring users experience immediate
value through pre-identified book size, personas, and target account recommendations rather
than facing empty-state setup friction.

MEDDPICC Agent Beta Launch: Gabe organized internal beta groups with Rev Ops and
resolved access issues to begin hands-on validation of automated MEDDPICC extraction
outputs before building any UI. The team is positioned to start internal testing next week with
named beta reps and trigger configurations, representing a significant step toward validating
extraction logic before UI investment.

Admin Defined Territories Near Completion: David achieved 90% completion on End User
Explainability for Admin Defined Territories, overcoming backward compatibility issues from
Ringlead's code refactoring. Despite engineering delays, the core functionality should complete
testing by week's end, clearing a major blocker for GA readiness.

Goals & Progress
Advanced Search Evolution: Al made substantial progress on UXR preparations with refined
prototypes and questionnaires, though he's waiting for final customer usage data to complete
invitee selection. The research framework is positioned to validate whether Advanced Search
deserves its name in the LLM era, with interviews potentially starting during his PTO next week
under Sarah's leadership.

Intent Topic Intelligence: Harinath completed 100% of auto-assignment framework
development and finished 80% of LRT processes for August releases including Intent
Recommendation and AFS Download functionality. The auto-assignment logic will reduce
friction by eliminating manual topic research while maximizing use of allocated Intent Topic slots,
though final verification with Al Nevarez remains pending.

Company Profile Transformation: Ant progressed on both dynamic company profile PRDs
and extension overhaul documentation, completing initial stakeholder review with strong
validation of the agentic profile direction. However, discussions with Victor revealed the strategic
tension between shipping incremental Phase 1 improvements versus investing in
comprehensive Phase 3 "zapier-style" agentic capabilities from the start.

Strategic Challenges

Engineering Competency Gaps for GTM Data Model Migration: David's team faces
knowledge transfer challenges as they migrate from current target/priority accounts to the GTM
data model needed for sophisticated CRM matching that upmarket customers demand. The
core issue isn't engineering skill but rather the learning curve required to understand new
platform capabilities, with key stakeholders Harsha and Imesh unavailable last week to provide
critical guidance.

Data Science Coordination Complexity: Adam discovered significant overlap between his
Day 1 intelligence initiative and the data science team's suggested company population work,
creating both opportunity and dependency risk. While there's potential gold in leveraging their
existing COI (companies of interest) capabilities for tenants without CRM setup, the timeline
uncertainty around AFS 2 makes this collaboration a calculated risk rather than a core
dependency.

Product Philosophy Tension on Incremental vs. Transformational Releases: The team is
grappling with whether to ship Phase 1 improvements to company profiles and other features
knowing they're "subpar" but provide immediate value, versus investing 3-5 months in Phase 3
capabilities that would create genuine market differentiation. This decision impacts multiple
workstreams and reflects broader questions about balancing short-term delivery pressure with
long-term competitive positioning.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries
Aha Moments Require Market-Relative Thinking: Victor's analysis revealed two types of aha
moments - those relative to our existing SalesOS platform and those relative to market
alternatives. The critical insight is that we must focus on market-relative aha moments to drive
actual user adoption and retention, not just internal feature comparisons that may seem
impressive but don't differentiate against competitors.

Standard vs. Custom Intent Topic Volume Imbalance: Al discovered that the intent topic
volume boost disproportionately benefits custom topics while leaving growth opportunity on
standard topics, which are more widely used and about to expand further with topic
recommendation features. This finding suggests the need for amended throughput logic that
significantly increases standard topic volume while preventing future decay, requiring
collaboration with COIN and Venkata.

Revenue Operations Integration Complexity: Gabe's work revealed that our custom intent
request process lacks logical connection with sold packages in Salesforce, potentially allowing
customers to receive custom topic benefits without appropriate entitlements. This discovery,
combined with the absence of maximum custom topic entitlement limits, suggests systematic
entitlement operations issues requiring review with Carlos Chevalier.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with the Data Science team on Day 1 intelligence presents both opportunity and risk
for Adam's onboarding initiatives. Their existing COI capabilities and suggested company
algorithms could dramatically accelerate user value creation for accounts without CRM setup,
but timeline uncertainty around AFS 2 makes this collaboration supplementary rather than
foundational to our core onboarding strategy.

The Search team dependency for David's GTM Data Model migration remains critical but
temporarily blocked by key personnel availability. Resolution requires coordination with Harsha
and Imesh to translate platform capabilities into actionable migration plans, with potential
overlap requiring Victor's involvement to align with Rowan's context team work.

Looking Ahead

Focus shifts to defining and implementing market-differentiating aha moments for
Copilot v2 launch, with Victor leading a cross-functional tiger team to ensure our
September release creates genuine competitive advantage rather than incremental
feature updates.

Next week's priorities center on three critical decisions that will shape our product trajectory.
First, we'll finalize the strategic approach to company profiles - whether to pursue
comprehensive agentic capabilities from the start or accept incremental improvements knowing
we historically don't revisit version 1.5 products. Second, Adam will complete the Data Science
alignment assessment to determine how much existing day-one intelligence we can leverage
without creating dependencies on uncertain AFS 2 timelines. Third, we'll begin internal beta
validation of MEDDPICC extraction with Rev Ops while Gabe advances emailer agent
capabilities for executive demo readiness.

The team is well-positioned to make these strategic decisions with strong execution momentum
across all workstreams. Our challenge is maintaining the discipline to choose transformational
impact over incremental progress, recognizing that market-leading aha moments require
patience and investment but create sustainable competitive advantages that incremental feature
releases cannot match.
