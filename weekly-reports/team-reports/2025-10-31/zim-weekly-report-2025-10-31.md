# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of October 27, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Team positions for \$15M annual DSP ad spend goal with \$2.9M remaining
across November-December following \$1.5M October achievement and
Adobe\'s \$200K single-month campaign commitment. Technology Advice
advances pixel deployment becoming first fully onboarded identity
partner while Adverity termination completes with DeltaX two-year \$540K
contract signed. Applied AI pod structure establishes Q1 2026 team
blending with Jenny and Troy joining Kate, Tamiro, and Harry Z for
identification and ZIM model expansion.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Brett Elliot successfully hardened semantic data agent for November 3rd
workbooks release following intensive testing validating 1,200 company
row processing capabilities. The agent architecture addresses Kubernetes
pod health check failures enabling scalable workbooks deployment while
awaiting final Sneh approval for production readiness confirmation.

Jesse Miller facilitated Applied AI onsite coordination establishing pod
structure blending Clickagy engineers (Jenny, Troy) with Applied AI team
(Kate, Tamiro, Harry Z) for identification and ZIM model work. Audience
monetization skeleton planning with Ben Goldman and Dators identifies
CPM-based approach requiring invoicing automation while highlighting
social channel package implications and demand package limit
considerations.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal completed website actions engineering
reprioritization through Amy and Allen coordination ensuring November
18th CFR delivery, while advancing identity partner T&C acceptance
through Google Forms creation approved by Brandon Tucker and James
Henry. Custom reporting QA progresses with production testing starting
November 4th alongside CSM feedback sessions with Robbie M and scheduled
CDM reviews.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Infrastructure Resolution**: Matt Barnes resolved 15% resolution rate
drop-off through IP extraction bug fix addressing multiple IP bot
flagging logic errors. Website journey signal definition completed
through comprehensive cross-team coordination with Andres, Sanyog,
Ganesh, Venkata, and Eric establishing attribute requirements and
FormComplete data pipeline integration scope.

**Partnership Advancement**: Anwar Mai secured Technology Advice pixel
deployment commitment following extended free data receipt period,
positioning first complete identity partner onboarding. Adobe RTCDP
integration testing continues post-code freeze with internal DME/DX
launch pending completion, while DeltaX contract commits two-year
partnership at \$540K preventing vendor exploration overhead.

**GTM Integration**: Shuxin Yang progressed ALI schema GTM Store
alignment requiring additional use case validation while identifying
data duplication challenges storing per-tenant intent data. Intent
quality investigation framework established across four areas: web HTML
extraction, keyword classification, topic classification, and precision
value measurement with Caleb\'s ownership.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal addresses GTM Config migration strategy for
existing customers switching from old to new configurations requiring
stakeholder POV consolidation and leadership alignment. The launch plan
decision remains open affecting future design work and requires
resolution next week for November delivery timeline maintenance.

Matt Barnes coordinates webhook project strategic approach with Brandon,
Amesh, and Ganesh following Brandon\'s preference for separate API
service over websites admin portal configuration. The discussion weighs
faster deployment through Marc Frail\'s workflow capabilities against
credit consumption tracking mechanism requirements and long-term
architectural flexibility.

Jesse Miller manages resource allocation concerns with Aiden handling
email notifications, Adobe API ownership, and temporal migration
simultaneously. The workload distribution requires priority
clarification through Q4 stack ranking finalization preventing
individual capacity overflow while maintaining delivery commitments.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Anwar Mai\'s coordination revealed Adobe October 28th launch date
occurred after two-week code freeze period highlighting partnership
communication gaps. Adobe\'s willingness to file exception for internal
DME/DX launch demonstrates partnership commitment while API readiness
challenges from ZoomInfo infrastructure changes require resolution for
testing completion.

Jesse Miller\'s Applied AI pod coordination establishes Q1 2026 team
structure blending Clickagy and Applied AI engineers under Sunita\'s TPM
leadership. The skeleton monetization planning reveals CPM-based
approach complexity requiring invoicing automation and SAP team heavy
lifting while Ben Goldman highlights social package and demand package
limit strategic implications.

Shuxin Yang discovered GTM Store intent data storage requires per-tenant
duplication creating hundreds of millions to billions of daily rows
without entitlement-based access control. The GTM Store team
investigates efficiency improvements while ALI schema development awaits
additional use case validation for comprehensive data model design.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Sneh on semantic data agent approval continues awaiting
production readiness confirmation for November 3rd workbooks GA. Brett
Elliot\'s hardening work validates 1,200 company processing while fuzzy
match capabilities position probabilistic analysis over exact keyword
search applications.

Partnership coordination with Technology Advice advances pixel
deployment requiring Matt Barnes knowledge transfer Monday for identity
partner onboarding process understanding. Adobe testing completion
enables internal launch exception filing while full GA release requires
post-testing validation and deployment planning.

Agent development coordination with Sunita\'s TPM leadership establishes
weekly meeting cadence and JIRA initiative structure for identification
and ZIM Applied AI pod. Troy and Jenny transition to Nilesh\'s LLM ops
pod contribution alongside dedicated ZIM model expansion
responsibilities.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week emphasizes cutline review and November release preparation
while Jesse advances monetization planning and agent platform team
integration coordination.

Anwar Mai reviews Q4 cutlines with Carlos requesting KTLO reprieve while
coordinating Q4 ad spend promotional campaigns and supporting Adobe
\$15M two-year renewal process. Matt Barnes completes website journey
pipeline additions and identity webhook project refinement while
finalizing November MCR remaining items and conducting flywheel
partnership knowledge transfer Monday. Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal finalizes
GTM Config launch plan decision and navigation bar migration strategy
while scheduling Kenny\'s team knowledge transfer for data deliveries
bandwidth optimization.

Jesse Miller advances agent functionality development through Troy
support coordination while progressing DMP API documentation and Meta
campaign management discovery. Email notification advancement continues
balancing Aiden\'s capacity constraints with temporal migration and
Adobe API priorities. Shuxin Yang focuses on ZIM UX quick wins
identification while coordinating ALI GTM Store schema finalization with
Linda and managing intent quality investigation launch following
Caleb\'s two-week PTO completion.

The team maintains execution momentum approaching \$15M annual goal
requiring \$1.5M monthly average across November-December while
navigating November 3rd workbooks GA deadline and November 18th feature
release coordination across custom reporting, conversion tracking,
website actions, and AI Page Rank deployments.
