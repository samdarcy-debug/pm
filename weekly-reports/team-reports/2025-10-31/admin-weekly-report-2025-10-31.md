### Executive Summary

The team has successfully achieved **full alignment on the AI credit
rollout for GTM Studio Early Access (EA) customers** and is executing
the plan to cut over internal tenants to the AI credit service. Jessie
Kain Lindstrom secured sign-off on the narrative, customer materials,
and the allocation of **25,000 AI credits** for remaining month for GTM
Studio EA customers. Brannen Huske, working with relevant teams, has a
cutover plan for November 3rd to ensure internal usage of AI credits is
tracked for accurate forecasting and usage data. The main strategic
challenge is the urgent need to transition to the live AI credit service
to gather **actual usage data**, as current estimates and modeling are
proving insufficient for accurate planning.

## This Week\'s Progress

### Key Momentum Areas

Jessie Kain Lindstrom achieved a significant win by getting **sign-off
on the number of AI credits and the final narrative** for GTM Studio EA
customers, completing all three high-leverage goals for the week. This
narrative and supporting materials are now with the design team and
ready for the critical Pricing and Packaging meeting on November 4th,
moving the GTM motion forward rapidly.

Brannen Huske and the broader team established a clear **cutover plan
for November 3rd** to switch internal tenants to using the AI credit
service. This is a crucial step driven by Victor\'s request to
understand how the company internally uses AI tools, which is essential
for better external projections and gathering real per-person,
per-action usage data.

A key technical blocker was addressed by realizing that enabling
**Copilot Workspace** via a feature flag prevented tracking customer
usage. The cutover plan to use the dedicated Copilot Workspace license
on November 3rd resolves this, enabling the use of our existing
analytics framework to accurately monitor customer adoption for Phoebe
and the broader team.

### Goals & Progress

**GTM Studio AI Credit Messaging and Allocation**: Jessie Kain Lindstrom
finalized and secured sign-off on the narrative and materials for GTM
Studio. GTM Studio EA customers will receive **25,000 credits** for the
remaining month, a number that aligns with the estimated \$240K annual
baseline for the product, allowing the team to monitor usage before the
upsell process.

**Internal AI Credit Cutover**: Brannen Huske partnered with GTM Studio,
Copilot Workspace, and the TPM org to develop a **cutover plan for
11/3** to transition internal tenants to AI credits. This work is
essential to gather real usage data---credits used per person, per
action---replacing the current reliance on estimates for better
projections.

**Workspace License Tracking**: To resolve the inability to track
customers using **Copilot Workspace** due to a feature flag, the team is
making the switch to the **Copilot Workspace license** as part of the
11/3 cutover. This transition will enable the team to leverage existing
analytic frameworks to gain visibility into adoption.

### Strategic Challenges

The primary challenge is the **lack of actual production data** on AI
credit usage, which is making credit forecasting difficult and
uncertain. While Jessie Kain Lindstrom has done modeling, the team
recognized that the sooner everyone, even internal users, is cut over to
the credit service, the faster they can get accurate, real-world data to
solidify projections.

A related challenge is the difficulty the Agentic team has had with
**easily aggregating existing usage data**, as it\'s not currently
stored in a format conducive to simple analysis. This reinforces the
urgency of pushing all users, starting with internal tenants, onto the
official AI credit service as the necessary **\"consistent way\"** to
track usage on a per-user basis.

## Strategic Insights

### Key Learnings & Discoveries

The most significant learning is that reliance on **modeling and
estimates for AI credit usage** creates too much churn and uncertainty.
As Jessie Kain Lindstrom noted, the team should have cut everyone over
to the credit service when it was ready, even if they weren\'t charging
at the time, just to gather the necessary **production data**.

Brannen Huske reinforced this, highlighting the assumption that the
Agentic team could easily \"fudge together\" credit usage data proved
incorrect because the data storage was not set up for that level of
analysis. This discovery makes the transition to the AI credit service
for all users a **critical long-term necessity** for product planning
and forecasting.

The discovery that enabling **Copilot Workspace with a feature flag**
blocked license tracking via analytics was an important finding. This
has driven the corrective action to shift to a proper license structure
on November 3rd, ensuring the team gains the necessary adoption metrics.

### Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with **Pricing and Packaging** is essential to finalize the GTM
motion. Jessie Kain Lindstrom has a deck ready for the crucial meeting
on November 4th, with a dry run scheduled for November 3rd, and is
highly confident in the current alignment.

The **TPM, GTM Studio, and Copilot Workspace teams** are critical
partners for Brannen Huske in executing the **November 3rd cutover
plan**. We also rely on **Adam Severance** (SME from Workspace) and
**Jagan** from **GTM Studio Team** to ensure a smooth transition for
both internal and early access customers.

## Looking Ahead

The primary focus for the next week is the **successful execution of the
cutover plan** on November 3rd and the subsequent **Pricing and
Packaging meeting** on November 4th.

The top priority is the **11/3 cutover**, led by Brannen Huske, to
ensure all internal and early access customers are using the AI credit
service and the proper Copilot Workspace licenses. This is the only path
to gather the **real usage data** needed to validate models and
projections, which will accelerate future product decisions. Following
this, Jessie Kain Lindstrom will present the final credit allocation and
narrative at the **Pricing and Packaging meeting on 11/4**.

Moving forward, the key learning for all new feature rollouts is that
the **AI credit service must be integrated on \"Day one\"** of early
access. This will establish the foundational data pipeline, even if
credits are initially free, and is a vital shift in how we approach our
EA programs to enable consistent per-user tracking.
