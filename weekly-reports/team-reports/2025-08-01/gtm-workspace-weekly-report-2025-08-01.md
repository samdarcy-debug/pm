SalesOS/Copilot Executive Roundup -
[July 28 - 31, 2025]

Executive Summary

Victor Oliveros has identified the critical need to ensure Copilot v2 delivers market-leapfrogging
"wow moments" beyond what competitors offer, as the current trajectory puts us only at market
parity by November launch. Gabe Pirela achieved 80% completion on AI emailer requirements
handoff and conversation intelligence enablement, while Adam Severance made significant
progress on onboarding journeys and launch readiness. The team successfully completed
100% of LRT processes for August releases including intent recommendation features targeting
12,000-30,000 customers, but faces a critical entitlement clash issue blocking copilot upsells
that requires immediate resolution.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Gabe Pirela successfully documented detailed AI emailer requirements and aligned with
engineering teams (Tomer) and design (Sarah) on implementation approach, positioning the
team for a critical August 11th demo showcase. His conversation intelligence work progressed
to 80% completion with marketing materials created and beta customers identified for early
access testing next week.

Adam Severance finalized the rollout strategy for Launch Copilot experience through direct
partnership with Mary's onboarding team, establishing a sustainable process of several
accounts per week with clear enterprise criteria. His work through the AI product marketing
engine yielded impressive results and high-fidelity user journey logic trees that identify strong
"aha moments" for SDR/BDR personas.

Ant Cuomo completed his initial product review on dynamic company profiles with Victor,
delivering solid research direction and validation insights from internal ZI chat usage analysis.
His comprehensive weekend prototyping work established clear foundations for both current
SalesOS integration and future Copilot v2 positioning across unified user experiences.

Goals & Progress

AI & Automation Development: Gabe Pirela achieved 80% completion on AI emailer tactical
requirements with engineering handoff scheduled and conversation intelligence enablement
progressing through beta customer identification for next week testing. Adam Severance
advanced Day 1 agent prototype development by 60% using ZI chatbot infrastructure, though
faced complexity in accounting for CRM versus non-CRM user paths that requires additional
logic refinement.

Product Launch Readiness: Adam Severance completed 90% of Launch Copilot onboarding
journey definition with clear enterprise security review criteria established for August 18th
percentage release. Hari Krishnamoorthy achieved 100% completion of LRT processes for
August month releases including intent recommendation, AFS download functionality, and
enhanced audit trail features targeting both copilot and marketing voice customers.

Technical Infrastructure & Integration: David Goulden made 60% progress on priority
accounts GTM data model dependencies despite key engineering resources being on vacation,
while advancing admin defined territories to 99% completion for end-user explainability in
staging. Ant Cuomo progressed 50% on extension overhaul PRD development and tactical
planning for reach-out functionality expansion to support the 50% of customers without CRM
integration.

Strategic Challenges

Victor Oliveros identified the fundamental challenge that current Copilot v2 development
trajectory will achieve market parity rather than market leadership by November launch,
requiring immediate strategic pivoting toward distinctive "wow moments" that differentiate from
competitors like People AI, Salesforce, and Scratchpad. The team needs crisp identification of
these breakthrough features with design mockups by end of next week to address this strategic
gap.

Al Nevarez encountered a months-old entitlement clash issue that blocks efficient copilot upsells
when existing customers upgrade packages, causing customer complaints about promised
features (500 topics) not being delivered due to legacy entitlement conflicts (stuck at 12 topics).
This technical debt requires mediation between two engineering teams with different solution
approaches and affects future workbook launches.

David Goulden faces significant uncertainty around GTM data model integration with classic
Advanced Search, where nobody understands potential breaking changes or impacts on
existing CRM filters, saved searches, intent features, and alerts functionality. Key architectural
decisions require coordination across multiple engineering teams with unclear ownership
boundaries and timeline dependencies.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries
Victor Oliveros discovered that market differentiation requires focusing on "aha moments
relative to the market" rather than just improvements over SalesOS, as competitor analysis
reveals widespread adoption of similar sheet-like interfaces and default sales team positioning.
The team's unique advantage lies in proprietary contact and lead data access, but this requires
better integration into user workflows to create tangible competitive moats.

Gabe Pirela learned that autonomous agent capabilities and "human in the loop" functionality
represent emerging market expectations, with strategic opportunities to implement selective
automation for specific use cases rather than wholesale interface replacement. Market trends
indicate 6-12 month leadership over current user expectations, creating a window for thoughtful
implementation of autonomous features where they add genuine value.

The team validated that retention and adoption plays for current SalesOS and Copilot v1
customers will drive the biggest immediate business impact for this year's growth targets, while
simultaneously building toward v2 capabilities. This dual-track approach balances short-term
revenue protection with long-term strategic positioning, particularly critical given enterprise
customers' tendency toward muscle memory and delayed feature adoption.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with the GTM data model team continues to be critical for unlocking priority accounts
functionality based on CRM matching. David Goulden requires immediate coordination with core
search architects and the platform team to resolve integration uncertainties and establish clear
engineering ownership boundaries for Q3 deliverables while planning Q4 custom fields
capabilities.

Al Nevarez needs urgent support from entitlement operations and engineering teams to resolve
the intent topic clash issue that blocks copilot upsells and threatens customer satisfaction. Frank
Drake's involvement as director of applications engineering provides the necessary technical
authority to establish proper staging environments and validate solutions before production
deployment.

Looking Ahead

Next week focuses on crystallizing Copilot v2's market-differentiated vision through collaborative
design sessions between Victor Oliveros, the PM team, and Shawn's design organization to
identify and mock up the top 5 breakthrough "wow moments" that will leapfrog competitor
offerings rather than simply match them.

The team will execute critical handoffs including Gabe Pirela's AI emailer to engineering for
August 11th demo preparation, Adam Severance's onboarding journey finalization with design
kickoff, and resolution of Al Nevarez's entitlement clash through Frank Drake's staging
environment reconstruction. David Goulden will leverage returning key personnel (Harsha) to
advance GTM data model integration planning while Ant Cuomo begins design collaboration on
dynamic profiles and extension overhaul integration.

Success depends on balancing immediate customer needs through current product
enhancements with breakthrough innovation that positions Copilot v2 as the definitive market
leader, supported by strong execution on August release commitments and resolution of
technical blockers that could impact customer upsell opportunities and satisfaction.
