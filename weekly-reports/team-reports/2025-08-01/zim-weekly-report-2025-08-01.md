# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of July 28, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**Breakthrough achievement in visitor resolution with 100% improvement
in identification rates, while \$1M monthly ad spend milestone
establishes new revenue baseline.** The team delivered exceptional
technical execution with Brett Elliot\'s person-first logic
implementation doubling visitor resolution capabilities to nearly 2%
identification rate. Strong momentum in post-pay optimization shows
early 20% ad spend increases, positioning platform for accelerated
growth toward \$100M ARR target.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Visitor Resolution Breakthrough**: Brett Elliot achieved
transformational success with person-first logic deployment in VRS,
**doubling the visitor resolution rate** to nearly 2% of all page
visitors identified at individual contact level. This represents
world-class B2B identity graph performance with LiveIntent integration
poised to drive further improvements next week.

**Revenue Growth Acceleration**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s post-pay
automation initiative demonstrates immediate market validation with
BizLibrary customer showing **20% month-over-month ad spend increase**
in July. Platform now maintains established \$1M monthly ad spend
baseline with clear trajectory toward \$100M ARR goals.

**ZIM Agent Platform Development**: Jesse Miller successfully launched
comprehensive ZIM Agent kickoff with cross-functional alignment across
Vulcan, Yoda, and QA teams. Platform-level thinking emergence with
Ali\'s guidance on notification center architecture and workflow
integration capabilities positioning team for scaled automation
delivery.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Technical Infrastructure Excellence**: Brett Elliot completed 100% of
person-first logic implementation with immediate production impact,
establishing foundation for upcoming LiveIntent integration that will
further enhance identification capabilities and market differentiation.

**Product Development Pipeline**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal progressed
post-pay SAP automation to 60% completion despite design iteration
requirements, with Connected TV and video ads enhancements advancing
toward Q3 delivery commitments and UI engineering coordination.

**Platform Integration Strategy**: Jesse Miller achieved 100% completion
on ZIM Agent PRD and notification center go/no-go assessment, with
workflow and no-code connector exploration advancing LiveRamp
integration opportunities and reducing custom API development
requirements.

**Infrastructure Access Resolution**: Matt Barnes resolved critical
staging admin portal access blocker, unblocking Domains and AI Page Rank
testing workflows while advancing customer beta readiness assessment for
potential September acceleration.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Platform Architecture Evolution**: Jesse Miller identified opportunity
to elevate notification center to global event bus level, requiring
architectural decisions on platform-wide versus app-specific deployment
models to maximize cross-system integration potential.

**Resource Allocation Optimization**: UI engineering capacity
constraints requiring careful Q3 initiative prioritization, with
Vulcan/Yoda team commitments needed for ZIM Agent, banner systems, and
LinkedIn campaign management enhancement evaluation.

**Design Iteration Requirements**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s post-pay
automation requiring additional engineering coordination cycles to
finalize technical architecture before SAP team handoff, highlighting
complexity of financial integration workflows.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**World-Class Identity Graph Potential**: Brett Elliot\'s achievement
positions ZoomInfo for industry leadership in B2B visitor
identification, with person-level resolution approaching 2% representing
significant competitive advantage over company-level identification
offered by competitors.

**Post-Pay Revenue Optimization**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s validation
of post-pay increasing customer ad spend by 20% demonstrates clear path
to revenue acceleration, with manual flow success indicating automation
potential for scaled adoption across customer base.

**Platform-Level Architecture Benefits**: Jesse Miller\'s discussions
with Ali reveal strategic value in platform-wide notification systems
and workflow integration, reducing app-specific development while
enabling cross-system data sharing and user experience consistency.

**Partnership Integration Scalability**: Team coordination on ZoomInfo
script deployment establishes optimal pathway for flywheel data
partners, enabling ID sync for retargeting and Clickagy page scraping
for intent signal enhancement.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Integration with platform teams essential for notification center
architecture elevation and workflow connector utilization, with Marc
Frail coordination advancing no-code solutions for LiveRamp audience
deployment.

UI engineering alignment critical for Q3 delivery commitments, requiring
capacity confirmation for ZIM Agent, banner systems, and LinkedIn
integration enhancements to support GTM plays motion development.

Legal team coordination continues for international expansion,
person-based targeting, and data partnership compliance, with Morrison
Forester external counsel engagement addressing regulatory requirements
across multiple initiatives.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on technical capability expansion and platform
architecture advancement, with team positioned to build on visitor
resolution breakthrough and revenue optimization validation.

**Brett Elliot** leads LiveIntent integration deployment for further
visitor resolution improvements, with potential to reach
industry-leading identification rates through continued technical
enhancement.

**Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal** advances Connected TV requirements and UI
engineering coordination for post-pay automation completion, supporting
\$100M ARR trajectory through revenue optimization and platform
expansion.

**Jesse Miller** deepens ZIM Agent development with ownership definition
and workflow integration exploration, while coordinating UI capacity
commitments for Q3 initiative delivery and platform-level architecture
advancement.

**Matt Barnes** progresses AI Page Rank customer beta preparation for
potential September acceleration, leveraging resolved staging access to
advance testing workflows and market readiness assessment.

Team maintains exceptional execution momentum with visitor resolution
breakthrough, revenue optimization validation, and platform architecture
evolution supporting continued market leadership in B2B identity and
advertising technology.
