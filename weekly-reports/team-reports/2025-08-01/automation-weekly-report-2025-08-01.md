# **Automation Executive Roundup - 8/1/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**MCP authentication breakthrough enables board demonstration while GTM
Plays execution planning reaches near completion.** Adam Peretz achieved
a 90% solution to MCP authentication challenges through a proxy server
approach that unlocks most OAuth login methods for agentic tools,
positioning the team to meet Dominic\'s board presentation timeline.
Both Marc Frail and Sam Massie completed their GTM Plays deliverables,
with existing triggers and actions covering most initial requirements
and a consolidated action library framework ready for discussion with
integration team.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Adam Peretz solved the critical MCP authentication challenge**,
developing a proxy server solution that enables most or possibly all
OAuth login methods through agentic tools. This breakthrough transforms
the previous week\'s enterprise adoption concerns into a viable path
forward, requiring only final testing and confirmation before full
implementation.

**Marc Frail discovered GTM Plays requirements largely align with
existing capabilities**, finding that most requested triggers and
actions for the initial release already exist in the platform. This
significantly reduces development complexity and timeline risk while
confirming the strategic direction of previous workflow investments.

**Sam Massie agrees with a type-agnostic data mapping approach**,
determining that the preferred user experience doesn\'t require schema
entry anywhere, instead relying on casting and inference within
operators. This decision simplifies the user interface while maintaining
flexible data handling capabilities across diverse API integrations.

### **Goals & Progress**

**MCP Authentication Resolution**: Adam Peretz reached 90% completion
with a proxy server solution that addresses the enterprise SSO
requirements identified as blockers last week. The remaining 10%
involves final testing and confirmation to ensure the approach delivers
all needed OAuth functionality, but confidence is high for completion by
next week.

**GTM Plays Execution Planning**: Marc Frail completed workflow roadmap
alignment with engineering, achieving initial estimates and aligned
prioritization to support GTM Plays. The discovery that existing
capabilities cover most initial requirements reduces execution risk and
validates previous platform investments.

**Single Action Library Framework**: Sam Massie completed requirements
drafting for a consolidated action library, establishing the framework
for ZoomInfo PMs to publish their applications\' APIs as actions in GTM
Plays. This creates a scalable approach for expanding automation
capabilities across the platform.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Internal enablement requirements add complexity to MCP launch**, with
Dominic requesting comprehensive documentation and demonstration
materials. Adam Peretz must coordinate with Brett Jacobs and Ken Elwell
to create enablement materials while conducting final technical
validation.

**Integration team coordination becomes critical for action library
success**, as Sam Massie\'s single action library framework requires
alignment across multiple product and engineering teams. The scalability
of GTM Plays depends on seamless integration across ZoomInfo\'s diverse
application portfolio.

**User flow exploration remains incomplete for GTM Plays**, with Marc
Frail noting that while trigger and action requirements are clear, the
user experience flows still need deeper investigation. This represents
potential execution risk if complex interaction patterns emerge during
detailed design.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Proxy server architecture unlocks enterprise MCP adoption**, with Adam
Peretz\'s solution enabling OAuth methods that were previously blocked
by MCP specification limitations. This approach maintains enterprise
functionality while working within current protocol constraints,
creating a viable path to market.

**GTM Plays validates existing workflow architecture**, as Marc Frail\'s
analysis revealed that most initial requirements already exist in the
platform. This confirms that previous workflow investments align with
strategic direction and reduces both development timeline and technical
risk.

**Type-agnostic data mapping simplifies user experience**, with Sam
Massie\'s approach eliminating schema requirements while maintaining
flexibility through intelligent casting and inference. This decision
prioritizes usability over strict type safety, reflecting the
platform\'s focus on user empowerment over technical constraints.

**Outreach demonstration provided valuable context**, with Adam Peretz
gaining deeper understanding of workflow triggers through yesterday\'s
call. This cross-team exposure helps ensure MCP integration aligns with
existing workflow patterns and user expectations.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Brett Jacobs and Ken Elwell collaboration is essential for MCP internal
enablement, requiring coordination on documentation, use case examples,
and demonstration materials to support the board presentation timeline.

Integration product and engineering teams are critical for single action
library success, as Sam Massie\'s framework requires coordinated
implementation across multiple ZoomInfo applications to achieve the
intended scalability.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on finalizing MCP launch readiness while advancing GTM
Plays integration capabilities across the platform.

Adam Peretz will complete final MCP functionality testing and coordinate
internal enablement materials, including slide development and
high-priority use case demonstrations to support the board presentation.
Marc Frail will continue collaborating with the GTM Plays team on
dependencies to extend available triggers and actions beyond the initial
release scope.

Sam Massie will discuss the single action library concept with
integration engineering and product teams, working to establish the
framework that enables ZoomInfo PMs to publish their APIs as GTM Plays
actions. The convergence of MCP authentication resolution and GTM Plays
execution readiness creates significant momentum toward delivering
integrated automation capabilities that span both agentic tools and
workflow orchestration.
