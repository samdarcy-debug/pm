Data Executive Roundup - July 28-31, 2025

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Partnership Operations Breakthrough: Brandon Tucker delivered a streamlined operational
process for ecosystem partnerships, working directly with procurement and legal teams to
create a dedicated deal desk. This addresses the critical 6+ week delay that was burning
partnerships with smaller businesses and CEOs who couldn't navigate our traditional vendor
processes. We now have a single point of contact in procurement and simplified legal
requirements for data partnerships.

Data Infrastructure Scale Achievement: Dana Hurtig's team completed knowledge transfer
and testing for the DIP platform, enabling us to process 1.1M Latin American companies from
the Rhetorik dataset. This represents our first major company infusion capability that will unlock
millions of contacts in strategic markets. The WDA team is scheduled to crawl for vitality and
descriptions early next week, with the first production run planned by week's end.

Signal Enhancement Momentum: Brandon Wilson achieved significant improvements to the
Won Deal Similar Account signal based on extensive feedback from sales teams. The enhanced
signal now provides clearer value proposition explanations and better account similarity
reasoning, with multiple iterations already deployed for internal review. This semantic data
integration represents a major step forward in signal relevancy and actionability.

Goals & Progress

User-Level Signal Relevance: Steve Hutchinson's analysis confirmed that Contact
Recommender integration could deliver 24% lift in person-based signals for tenants,
representing contacts not currently captured in Person of Interest or Buying Committee models.
The team has scheduled cross-functional meetings with data science to determine optimal
implementation approach, whether through user-level POI integration or downstream caching
strategies.

Vertical Dataset Framework: Dow Jones completed the critical value framework document for
vertical datasets, working with Brett and Jen to establish consistent positioning across all future
dataset releases. This foundational approach will enable scalable sales processes rather than
requiring distinct approaches for each of the 12+ datasets planned for the next 6-12 months.
The framework was successfully tested in a customer meeting and showed immediate
improvement in conversation quality.
Compliance & Risk Management: Rob Priore completed the monthly cookie audit across 21
domains, identifying new compliance violations and escalating the critical issue where cookies
fail to load upon landing. This technical problem may be significantly limiting marketing
effectiveness, and OneT rust has been engaged for vendor review of Google Tag Manager
settings. Additionally, swapper.exe certificate issues are creating customer concerns about
malware, requiring immediate attention.

Strategic Challenges

Email Validation Compliance Conflict: The California and Oregon privacy law requirements to
remove email validation for opt-out requests creates significant risk exposure. While George
Jones agrees we shouldn't remove the control, legal ambiguity remains around implementation.
Without email validation, bad actors could potentially harvest emails or conduct mass opt-out
campaigns against key contacts in these jurisdictions. Rob Priore is working with Hannah to
develop a generic response system with secondary confirmation, but this remains a critical
vulnerability that could impact data quality across our highest-value regions.

Technical Infrastructure Dependencies: Multiple teams are experiencing delays due to
backend complexity in admin panels and data access requirements. The CN Admin Panel
updates are blocked due to disparate ownership and maintenance issues, while Steve
Hutchinson's team needs Xverum member data in ZDP to advance the facilitators model. These
technical dependencies are creating cascading delays across signal enhancement and data
quality initiatives.

Resource Allocation Pressure: Analysis resources are stretched thin across competing
priorities, with Ethan Young and Jody Roberts both flagging capacity constraints. The definition
of company work, technographic backlog elimination, and H2 roadmap planning are all
competing for limited analytical bandwidth. This resource constraint is particularly impacting
customer-facing initiatives and strategic planning efforts.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

Partnership Process Transformation: Our discovery that 50-question security reviews for
simple CSV data transfers was overwhelming potential partners revealed a fundamental
misalignment between our procurement processes and partnership reality. Small businesses
and CEOs were abandoning partnerships due to process burden rather than commercial
disagreement. The new deal desk approach recognizes that data partnerships carry different
risk profiles than infrastructure purchases and require partnership-oriented rather than
vendor-purchaser frameworks.

Semantic Data Signal Enhancement: Brandon Wilson's iterative work on the Won Deal Similar
Account signal demonstrated that semantic data integration requires extensive refinement to
deliver actionable insights. The feedback loop with account managers revealed that signal
explanations and similarity reasoning are as important as the underlying recommendations. This
learning will inform how we approach the New Rep signal and other semantic data applications.

Data Quality Automation Opportunities: Dana Hurtig's team achieved 5x efficiency
improvements in conference automation and successfully implemented EMS automation in
production. The IPO contacts automation and 160K junk CxO profile cleanup demonstrate that
AI-driven automation can deliver both efficiency gains and quality improvements simultaneously.
This validates our strategic direction toward automated data quality management.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with the WDA team on Rhetorik data crawling remains critical for the Latin American
expansion initiative. Dana Hurtig has scheduled vitality and description crawling for next week,
with the engineering team providing necessary platform support. Any delays in this crawling
work will directly impact our ability to deliver the promised contact coverage for Oracle, Uber,
and Salesforce.

The relationship with the data science team is becoming increasingly important for Contact
Recommender integration and user-level POI development. Steve Hutchinson's analysis shows
significant signal lift potential, but implementation requires careful coordination on API
limitations, caching strategies, and potential feedback loop risks from amplitude data that
includes co-pilot views.

Looking Ahead

Next week's Vancouver onsite will focus on vertical dataset processes, production integration,
and GTM enablement strategies. This represents a critical alignment opportunity as we scale
from individual dataset launches to systematic vertical data capability.

Our immediate priorities center on executing the first DIP company infusion run while
simultaneously advancing the restaurant dataset toward its August 11th launch target. The
restaurant dataset GTM materials must reach go-to-market teams well before launch to enable
proper enablement and preparation. Brandon Wilson will continue iterating on the New Rep
signal to complement the enhanced Won Deal signal, creating a comprehensive semantic data
signal suite.

The partnership operations improvements and vertical dataset framework completion position
us to accelerate both ecosystem expansion and revenue generation from specialized datasets.
With our infrastructure capabilities now proven through the Latin American company infusion
and our processes streamlined for partner onboarding, we're prepared to deliver sustained
growth in both data coverage and partnership velocity.
