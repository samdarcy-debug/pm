# ***ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of September 8, 2025***

## ***Executive Summary***

*Account brief generation achieved 25x efficiency improvement through
Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s pipeline redesign using off-the-shelf LLMs,
while contact targeting campaigns went live in production with Brett
Elliot confirming bidding success and impression delivery. Forrester
Wave preparation positions ZoomInfo as #2 revenue marketing platform
behind 6sense, requiring cross-functional coordination as the team
advances toward October flywheel data partner self-serve launch.*

## ***This Week\'s Progress***

### ***Key Momentum Areas***

*Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal delivered the account brief pipeline redesign,
transitioning from custom-built models to off-the-shelf LLMs and
generating briefs 25 times faster than the previous system. This
enhancement powers Copilot\'s customer intelligence delivery and enables
sales professionals to access comprehensive company summaries including
founding details, employee counts, and target personas at unprecedented
scale.*

*Brett Elliot achieved production deployment of contact targeting
campaigns with live bidding and impression delivery confirmed across the
platform. The hedge fund POC deliveries are flowing through Bobsled to
the presumed Citadel destination, while privacy cluster integration into
VRS progresses with potential improvements identified for next week
implementation.*

*Jesse Miller advanced ZIM Agent development through
backend-for-frontend endpoint identification and resolved SendGrid
access challenges with Kevin Hopkinson\'s guidance. The forecasting UI
preparation for Tuesday GA release coordinates with comprehensive email
template development framework and simplified agent response
capabilities.*

### ***Goals & Progress***

***Infrastructure Development**: Matt Barnes completed website identity
data pipeline development with successful mapping coordination through
Andres Perez and Sanyog Rai, enabling company and person data delivery
to the data store. Adobe Analytics UX design completion in 1.5 days
positions late September or early October launch while addressing Path
Factory API investigation discrepancies.*

***Partnership Ecosystem**: Anwar Mai initiated Forrester Wave demo
script development requiring coordination across sales, customer
experience, product, and engineering teams for revenue marketing
evaluation. Flywheel data partner self-serve framework development
advances with legal and security coordination while TypeForm
relationship progression and Adobe product roadmap discussions
continue.*

***Platform Integration**: Shuxin Yang progressed intent roadmap
synchronization with front-end team alignment and ZIM UX feedback
analysis through amplitude event review. Platform and app initiative
coordination with GTM Config integration planning establishes foundation
for enhanced intent capabilities within the broader GTM Studio
ecosystem.*

### ***Strategic Challenges***

*Matt Barnes faces jury duty uncertainty affecting availability for
September 16th release coordination, bot filtering beta customer
recruitment, and mid-quarter delivery assessments across COIN and
Inferno teams. Path Factory investigation reveals 17% overlap
discrepancy between API calls and UI results, requiring urgent
resolution due to sales and marketing team dependency for lead
generation partnership value.*

*Anwar Mai coordinates complex legal and security hurdles for flywheel
data partner self-serve deployment requiring Brennan team coordination
and comprehensive compliance framework development. The self-attestation
process for partners deploying ZoomInfo pixels while receiving 5,000
enriched records needs legal approval to prevent technology misuse
liability.*

*Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal manages account brief quality measurement
requirements following the 25x efficiency improvement, requiring prompt
optimization and feedback integration to ensure quality standards
maintain pace with volume increases.*

## ***Strategic Insights***

### ***Key Learnings & Discoveries***

*Anwar Mai\'s ELT coordination established the flywheel data partner
self-serve vision enabling partners to deploy ZoomInfo pixels through
self-attestation while receiving 5,000 enriched records in exchange.
This approach could enable exponential cookie pool growth and intent
data collection from partner customer websites, potentially including
enterprise accounts like HP or IBM if security teams approve Path
Factory pixel deployment.*

*Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s account brief pipeline analysis revealed
dramatic efficiency improvements possible through off-the-shelf LLM
adoption over custom-built models. The transition from generating
150,000 daily briefs to millions demonstrates the scalability potential
of modern AI infrastructure for customer intelligence delivery across
the Copilot platform.*

*Matt Barnes discovered that purchased entitlements prevent certain
company data visibility in WebSights, affecting approximately 1% of
traffic resolution. This finding during the website identity data
pipeline development explains some resolution gaps and informs future
data access policies for enhanced visitor identification capabilities.*

### ***Cross-Team Dependencies***

*Our work with the Forrester evaluation team requires extensive
coordination for revenue marketing assessment, with website
personalization capabilities, intent features, and buying group
management needing Team21 PM support since no one currently owns buying
groups functionality.*

*Path Factory partnership resolution remains essential for sales and
marketing lead generation, with Matt Barnes\' investigation revealing
96% API resolution success despite partner claims of only 17% overlap
requiring technical alignment and communication improvement.*

*Adobe partnership coordination continues through Friday product roadmap
review while flywheel data partner legal framework development needs
Brennan team security coordination for October self-serve launch
timeline.*

## ***Looking Ahead***

*Next week focuses on production deployment coordination and strategic
partnership advancement, with the team positioned to deliver forecasting
UI GA and resolve partnership technical challenges.*

*Anwar Mai leads ELT follow-up coordination for flywheel data partner
legal and security mitigation while advancing Adobe product roadmap
discussions and finalizing TypeForm partnership agreements. Jesse Miller
ensures smooth forecasting UI GA rollout on Tuesday while advancing ZI
tag analysis and email template development. Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal
delivers agent demo recording by Tuesday while progressing account brief
quality analysis and GTM Config schema documentation.*

*Matt Barnes manages jury duty availability while progressing website
identity data PRD revision and Path Factory investigation resolution for
September 16th release coordination. Brett Elliot analyzes real customer
contact targeting results while maintaining hedge fund POC delivery
confirmation. Shuxin Yang continues ZIM amplitude review and intent
platform alignment with GTM Store integration planning.*

*The team maintains strong execution momentum with production
deployments advancing and strategic partnership frameworks developing to
support continued platform expansion and competitive positioning in the
revenue marketing category.*
