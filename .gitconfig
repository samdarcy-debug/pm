# Git Configuration for PM Knowledge Repository
# This config enables automatic rebase on pull/push to prevent "outdated master" errors

[pull]
    # Always rebase instead of merge when pulling
    rebase = true

[push]
    # Automatically set up remote tracking for new branches
    autoSetupRemote = true

[rebase]
    # Automatically stash and pop uncommitted changes during rebase
    autoStash = true
    # Don't automatically squash commits (preserve commit history)
    autoSquash = false

[merge]
    # Use the "ours" strategy for conflicting changes to YAML frontmatter (prefer local)
    # This prevents metadata conflicts from blocking work
    conflictstyle = zdiff3

[core]
    # Ensure consistent line endings across platforms
    autocrlf = input
