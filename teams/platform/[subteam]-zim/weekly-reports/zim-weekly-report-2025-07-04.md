# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of June 30, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

H2 strategic planning is now complete with clear roadmap documentation
defining goals across Ads, WebSights/FormComplete, and Intent for Q3 and
Q4. Critical infrastructure improvements delivered this week, including
resolution of 5x5 IP-to-company data ingestion (expected 2.7% lift in
company identification) and LiveRamp contract execution providing 15-20%
reach increase for advertising segments. Team achieved 100% goal
completion rate despite shortened holiday week, with key foundations now
in place for Q3 execution.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**H2 Planning Foundation Completed**: Anwar Mai successfully delivered
comprehensive H2 planning documentation covering Ads,
WebSights/FormComplete, and Intent initiatives, establishing clear
strategic direction for Q3 and Q4 execution with identified dependencies
and resource requirements.

**Infrastructure Breakthroughs**: Matt Barnes resolved critical 5x5
IP-to-company data ingestion blocker by implementing file splitting
solution, unlocking expected 2.7% improvement in company identification
accuracy - the highest impact from any third-party dataset integration
to date.

**Revenue-Driving Partnerships**: Jesse Miller completed LiveRamp
contract execution and DMP API planning, positioning team for 15-20%
reach increase in advertising segments and potential new revenue streams
through data marketplace partnerships.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Advertising & Forecasting**: Jesse Miller achieved 100% completion on
international and video forecasting improvements, with production
deployment scheduled for July 7th behind feature flags. LiveRamp B2B
Graph integration now active, providing immediate reach expansion
capabilities for customer segments.

**Conversion & Customer Success**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal delivered 100%
completion on conversion tracking improvements planning, Q2 KPI
documentation updates, and Predictive Clearing release for all Trade
Desk customers. Successfully addressed at-risk customer (Orolabs)
through comprehensive issue resolution and stakeholder engagement.

**Data & Intent Pipeline**: Shuxin Yang progressed AI-based topic
recommendation initiative with completed high-level approach
documentation, establishing multi-quarter roadmap spanning Q3 data
science model development through Q1 2026 GA release.

**Legal & Compliance**: Brett Elliot completed legal documentation
submission for LiveRamp RampID and UID2 contact targeting, ensuring
regulatory compliance for ongoing advertising operations and potential
expansion of targeting capabilities.

**Technical Infrastructure**: Matt Barnes resolved critical mmdb file
size limitation through systematic root cause analysis and file
splitting implementation, with additional monitoring alerts deployed to
prevent future silent failures.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Resource Allocation Complexity**: Team now managing expanded portfolio
including ads, intent, COIN, websights, formcomplete, and partner
integrations, requiring careful capacity planning and potential work
prioritization as 50% of engineering resources will be on PTO next week.

**Customer Retention Pressures**: Active management of at-risk accounts
including Orolabs threatening to move to 6Sense, requiring continued
focus on conversion tracking improvements and advanced feature
development to match competitive offerings from strategic segment
customers like Wayfair.

**Technical Integration Dependencies**: Multiple initiatives requiring
cross-team coordination including ZI API endpoints, agentic platform
integration, and Data Warehouse connections to Snowflake, necessitating
careful dependency management and timeline alignment.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**AI-Driven Decision Making Validation**: Matt Barnes discovered through
blind testing that customers accepted AI Page Rank recommendations in
approximately 50% of disagreement cases, suggesting strong potential for
AI-driven insights to influence customer decision-making when supported
by clear, logical reasoning.

**Video Advertising Market Expansion**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal
identified significant traction in video ads among customer base, with
newly onboarded strategic customers like Wayfair requesting advanced
features like contextual targeting, indicating market readiness for
premium advertising capabilities.

**Conversion Tracking Pain Points**: Analysis revealed customers
experiencing distinct issues with form fill conversions based on whether
they use FormComplete, suggesting need for separate conversion type
categorization to improve user experience and adoption rates.

**Multi-Quarter AI Initiative Roadmap**: Shuxin Yang established clear
timeline for AI Topic Classification spanning Q3 data science model
development, Q3 quality monitoring and document cleaning improvements,
Q4 MVP implementation, and Q1 2026 GA release.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Data Science team on AI topic classification remains
critical for improving intent signal accuracy and lead quality. Current
coordination includes Q3 model development and quality monitoring system
implementation, with engineering resources needed for Q4 pipeline
integration.

Integration with the Agentic Platform team continues to be essential for
AdOps Agent development, with Jesse Miller and Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal
coordinating on Custom Reporting and AdOps agent interfaces to deliver
comprehensive automation capabilities.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on maximizing solo PM work during reduced engineering
capacity, with 50% of technical resources on PTO providing opportunity
for strategic planning and prototype development.

Top priorities include advancing AdOps Agent prototype integration into
Lars\' Agentic Platform repository, completing cross-agent interface
planning between Custom Reporting and AdOps agents, and continuing H2
planning refinement with detailed JPD work allocation. Jesse Miller will
focus on LiveRamp API automation milestone definition, while Matt Barnes
concentrates on Q3 planning finalization and Q2 project risk assessment
across COIN, WebSights, and Intent initiatives.

The team maintains strong momentum heading into Q3 execution, with
foundational infrastructure improvements delivered and strategic
partnerships activated to support expanded advertising capabilities and
customer retention efforts.
