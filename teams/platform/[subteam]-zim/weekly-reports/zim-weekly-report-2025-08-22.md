# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of August 18, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Critical GTM Config/Context milestone achieved with November 18th
customer release target and October 18th code complete deadline
established, while Identity Matrix competitive evaluation and Adobe ECID
strategy development position team for enhanced visitor resolution
capabilities. Team delivered 82% goal completion rate with major
progress on bot identification beta, ZIM Agent timelines, and strategic
partnership data collection. Legal resolutions advance with CapitalRx
guidance and Beeswax MSA progression supporting international expansion
capabilities.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**GTM Config Strategic Milestone**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal achieved 100%
completion on GTM Configuration requirements definition with confirmed
November 18th customer release target and October 18th code complete
deadline. Successfully established product/solution level configuration
approach with 10-12 dataset consolidation into Postgres, enabling
streamlined data engineering execution across Venkara\'s COIN team.

**Identity Resolution Innovation**: Anwar Mai initiated competitive
evaluation of Identity Matrix through pixel deployment on ZoomInfo\'s
identify-website-visitors page, while advancing WBID API PRD development
and Adobe ECID strategy documentation. Strategic positioning for
enhanced visitor identification capabilities through multi-vendor
assessment and Adobe Experience Cloud integration planning.

**ZIM Agent Development Excellence**: Jesse Miller progressed ZIM Agent
implementation to 90% completion with comprehensive timeline definition
targeting October 15th MVP delivery to internal teams. Successfully
established MCP server framework with tool call definitions and
coordinated cross-functional development across Troy (campaign
sub-agent) and conversion modeling kickoff with Jenny.

**Bot Identification Production Readiness**: Matt Barnes advanced
September release documentation to 70% completion while coordinating bot
identification beta framework for opt-in customer filtering. Frontend
designs completed with backend development progressing toward September
16th release target for automated traffic percentage visibility.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Strategic Partnership Advancement**: Anwar Mai provided critical legal
guidance on CapitalRx demand letter regarding LiveRamp wiretap
allegations (dismissed last month), while advancing Technology Advice
script deployment coordination and Adobe 2026 planning preparation for
onsite engagement.

**Data Pipeline Architecture**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal completed WSL=1
removal from ZI Script for Path Factory and Vendr partners, enabling
intent data collection while advancing Known Contact Activity API
discovery for Adobe and IBM integration requirements. Beeswax MSA legal
review nearing completion with inventory versus transaction data
differentiation clarification.

**Intent Roadmap Optimization**: Shuxin Yang achieved 90% completion on
customer-oriented roadmap restructuring despite engineering discovery
requirements for Custom Intent Accelerator timeline accuracy. Strategic
ZoomInfo initiative impact assessment progressing for GTM Config and GTM
Studio integration planning.

**Forecasting Infrastructure**: Jesse Miller deployed improved
forecasting UI to production behind feature flags, with three-week
testing window established before September customer-facing
announcement. LiveRamp activation discovery advancing through LinkedIn
API testing and no-code data connector exploration.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Engineering Resource Dependencies**: Matt Barnes identifying design
team resource gaps due to recent departures affecting documentation
updates, while September release features await staging deployment for
comprehensive testing validation.

**Adobe Partnership Timeline Pressure**: Anwar Mai coordinating onsite
engagement for 2026 planning while managing continued delays from
initial March target through multiple timeline adjustments requiring
executive intervention for resource commitment.

**Cross-Team Coordination Complexity**: Multiple initiatives requiring
careful dependency management including GTM Data Model consolidation,
Global Event Bus integration, and UI team allocation across Yoda
engineering for GTM Config Context development.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**GTM Config Architecture Clarity**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s
coordination established that GTM Configuration operates at
product/solution level rather than account level, requiring systematic
dataset organization across intent topics, clusters, websites buyer ID,
competitors, and complementary technologies for scalable customer
customization.

**Identity Matrix Competitive Assessment**: Anwar Mai\'s pixel
deployment enables direct comparison of identification capabilities
against emerging competitors, providing strategic intelligence for
visitor resolution enhancement and market positioning validation.

**Data Flywheel Enhancement**: Jesse Miller\'s coordination with Ben
Goldman on LiveRamp audience activation reveals opportunity to receive
company-level data back from external activations, creating warm lead
pipeline for sales team targeting customers using ZoomInfo data
externally.

**Partnership Data Collection Success**: Removal of WSL=1 from partner
scripts enables intent data collection from Path Factory and Vendr,
validating strategic approach to partner ecosystem data contribution
while maintaining script deployment simplicity.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Adobe partnership requires continued coordination with Experience Cloud
teams for ECID strategy implementation and 2026 roadmap integration,
with onsite engagement advancing technical specification development.

GTM Config execution depends on Tingting and Rowan coordination for UI
assignment to Yoda engineering team, while data engineering requirements
finalization supports November delivery timeline maintenance.

Legal team collaboration essential for Beeswax MSA completion and
international expansion approval, while CapitalRx resolution
demonstrates proactive regulatory compliance and partner protection
capabilities.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on Adobe onsite engagement and September release
preparation, with team positioned to deliver critical customer-facing
capabilities while advancing strategic partnership and technical
architecture foundations.

**Anwar Mai** attending Adobe 2026 planning discussions through onsite
engagement while finalizing WBID API PRD and advancing ECID strategy
documentation with engineering team review and Technology Advice script
deployment coordination.

**Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal** coordinates GTM Config data engineering
requirements finalization while advancing Tingting and Rowan UI team
assignment coordination and API requirements gathering for Q4 execution
preparation.

**Jesse Miller** continues ZIM Agent MCP server finalization with
endpoint connections and tool call definitions while advancing
conversion modeling kickoff and LiveRamp activation planning through Ben
Goldman review coordination.

**Matt Barnes** progresses September release documentation completion
for Domains and Bot Identification while managing frontend staging
deployment timeline and design team resource coordination challenges.

**Shuxin Yang** advances strategic ZoomInfo initiative impact assessment
for intent roadmap integration while continuing customer-oriented
roadmap restructuring and engineering discovery coordination for Custom
Intent Accelerator timeline accuracy.

Team maintains strong execution momentum with GTM Config milestone
achievement, competitive identity assessment advancement, and September
release preparation supporting continued platform expansion and customer
value delivery acceleration.
