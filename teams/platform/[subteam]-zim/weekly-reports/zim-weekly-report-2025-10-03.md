# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of September 29, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Website buyer ID data achieved initial GTM Data Model load completion
through Matt Barnes and Eric Vanhelene\'s coordination, while privacy
cluster VRS integration delivered modest 0.11 percentage point visitor
resolution improvement. Forrester live demo preparation advances toward
October 9th presentation as team navigates resource prioritization
decisions with 30 developers managing 42 projects. Retroactive intent
demo exceeded minimal delivery requirements while flywheel partner
framework simplifies compliance through partner-level data deletion
approach.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Matt Barnes completed initial website buyer ID data load into GTM Data
Model through coordination with Eric Vanhelene, enabling data store
integration for downstream applications. The website identity data
pipeline progresses toward production deployment despite IE ticket
dependencies while AI Page Rank early access preparations advance
pending staging environment availability.

Shuxin Yang delivered retroactive intent demo exceeding minimal
requirements while supporting topic pausing and archiving capabilities
in production. Expanded Predictive data analysis with full month-period
page visits confirms minimal URL overlap with Clickagy data, validating
continued vendor partnership evaluation alongside Pachintel integration
discussions.

Brett Elliot completed privacy cluster VRS integration increasing
WebSights visitor resolution rate by 0.11 percentage points from 2.18%
to 2.29% without additional compute costs. The team celebrated VRS
adoption expansion with Match service integration establishing visitor
identity single source of truth across multiple platform applications.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Agent Development**: Jesse Miller completed Adverity migration
enabling legal communication for contract termination based on breach
arguments, while advancing agent demonstration preparation despite MCP
server technical issues. ZI tag analysis reviewed with Carlos and
engineering teams positions infrastructure optimization recommendations
and quick-win ticket identification for Ganesh\'s execution.

**GTM Config Advancement**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal finalized evaluation
framework for GTM Config and onboarding agent with Tingting while
progressing [Account Briefs]{.underline} QA across multiple datasets
including competitors, complementary technologies, and buying personas.
Privado partnership specification completed requiring additional \$50K
annual investment for flywheel partner page scanning capabilities.

**Platform Integration**: Shuxin Yang completed audience amplitude
analysis revealing Advanced Search dominance as primary audience creator
while identifying low-volume audience challenges. Workbooks integration
into ZIM requires alignment with Sales OS development efforts to
maintain feature parity as separate audience manager approach proves
unsustainable.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Matt Barnes manages support request volume affecting original goal
achievement while coordinating IE ticket resolution for website identity
pipeline production deployment. Legal discovery reveals Copilot Pro Lite
customer contract terms potentially prohibiting automatic WebSights Lite
data collection, requiring Q3 development resource diversion pending
investigation resolution.

Anwar Mai coordinates resource prioritization decisions with 30
developers managing 42 projects requiring systematic roadmap assessment
and capacity-based cutline establishment. Forrester live demo
preparation on October 9th requires cross-functional coordination during
9-11am Pacific time window necessitating code deployment restrictions
and engineering team availability.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal evaluates Path Factory data warehouse integration
rationale following document review revealing WebSights capabilities
potentially duplicate partner offerings. Flywheel partner execution
planning requires dependency mapping and engineering kickoff
coordination following Monday PTO affecting meeting participation.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Anwar Mai\'s flywheel partner framework coordination established
simplified compliance approach eliminating quarantine requirements
through partner-level data deletion implementation. This architectural
decision streamlines deployment timelines while maintaining privacy
compliance through Privado scanning validation at \$50K annual
investment.

Shuxin Yang\'s retroactive intent implementation revealed production
capabilities supporting topic pausing and archiving workflows applicable
to additional use cases beyond original scope. The expanded Predictive
data analysis confirms minimal Clickagy URL overlap validating vendor
partnership diversification strategy for enhanced intent signal
coverage.

Matt Barnes discovered legal contract complications with Copilot Pro
Lite bundling potentially prohibiting WebSights Lite automatic data
collection unlike standalone product deployment. This finding affects
data contribution assumptions for bundled product customers requiring
investigation and potential development resource allocation for
remediation.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Rowan Bailey\'s team on GTM Config continues advancing
through Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s account briefs QA coordination and
dataset consolidation efforts. The evaluation framework finalization
enables agent development progression while schema documentation
supports GTM Store ingestion planning.

Partnership coordination with Privado requires specification
finalization and POC approval for flywheel partner page scanning
capabilities. Jesse Miller\'s coordination with Deeksha Taneja\'s demand
generation team advances LinkedIn campaign execution for ZoomInfo
marketing while supporting internal platform validation.

Forrester evaluation coordination requires cross-functional team
availability during October 9th live demonstration including engineering
team participation and code deployment freeze during presentation
window.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week emphasizes Forrester live demonstration delivery and
production deployment coordination while advancing agent capabilities
and partnership framework execution.

Anwar Mai leads Forrester live demo presentation on October 9th while
coordinating roadmap prioritization decisions and resource allocation
planning. Matt Barnes focuses on website identity data pipeline
production deployment and AI Page Rank early access preparation
requiring staging environment availability and participant recruitment.
Jesse Miller advances agent UI integration in ZIM while developing
CloudFlare removal proposal for InfoSec review and coordinating Jenny\'s
involvement in agentic evaluation framework development.

Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal progresses flywheel partner execution planning
through dependency mapping and engineering kickoff coordination while
continuing account briefs quality analysis and GTM Config schema
documentation. Brett Elliot maintains privacy cluster VRS monitoring
while supporting visitor identity platform expansion. Shuxin Yang
advances intent data science roadmap coordination and workbooks
integration planning while evaluating Sales OS feature compatibility
requirements.

The team maintains execution momentum despite resource constraints
requiring strategic prioritization decisions to balance 42 projects
across available development capacity while preparing for competitive
evaluation and partnership ecosystem expansion.
