# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of July 7, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Major breakthrough in AI agent development with successful migration of
AdOps agent to ZI Agentic Platform, while predictive clearing
optimization delivers immediate margin improvements and reduced CPMs.
Team demonstrated strong execution despite reduced engineering capacity
during holiday week, with 90% code portability achieved in agent
platform transition. Critical Q3 planning milestones reached with JIRA
structure implementation and partner integration framework establishment
positioning team for scaled delivery.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Visitor Resolution Rate improvement:** Matt Barnes and the COIN team
had an 11% improvement in VRR with the integration of 5x5 data.
Improvement will also increase when the team moves to person first
resolution.

**AI Agent Platform Success**: Jesse Miller achieved successful
migration of AdOps agent from Cline prototype to ZI Agentic Platform
repository, with 90% code portability demonstrating strong architectural
alignment. Late-night collaboration with Ryan Stevens resulted in fully
functional agent deployment, setting foundation for enterprise-grade
automation capabilities.

**Predictive Clearing Optimization**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal delivered
comprehensive analysis of predictive clearing impact, demonstrating
successful margin improvements with higher CPMs, lower effective costs,
and increased impressions/clicks. CDP migration completed successfully
with recommendation for margin adjustments next month.

**Person-Level Intent Architecture**: Shuxin Yang established clear
technical approach for person-based intent pipeline transformation, with
data science team alignment on rule-based scoring system similar to
company intent methodology. Volume scaling considerations addressed with
All coordination on tactical implementation approach.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Agent Platform Development**: Jesse Miller completed 100% of
documentation spike and PMM enablement for Notification Center, with
successful AdOps agent migration demonstrating technical feasibility of
agentic automation at scale. Custom reporting agent development
advancing through Lars coordination.

**Q3 Planning Foundation**: Anwar Mai achieved comprehensive JIRA
structure implementation across team one-on-ones, establishing organized
priorities and scoping framework for Q3 delivery confidence. Partnership
integration framework development with Andres providing repeatable
process for partner onboarding.

**Technical Discovery**: Matt Barnes completed website buyer ID pipeline
discovery, revealing architecture strengths/weaknesses and identifying
need for complete re-architecture in early Q3. Global services timeline
extension to August impacting workbook requirements timeline to December
release.

**Performance Analysis**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal initiated critical CPA
drop analysis for Trade Desk campaigns, investigating 6-month declining
trend to identify root causes and optimization opportunities.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Engineering Capacity Constraints**: Reduced engineering availability
during holiday week creating coordination challenges for UI/backend
synchronization, particularly affecting forecasting feature releases
requiring careful timeline management.

**Partner Integration Scaling**: Need for systematic partner data
tracking and value assessment framework to evaluate partner
contributions and support negotiation strategies. Current inability to
track audience syndication usage data limiting optimization
capabilities.

**Technical Architecture Decisions**: Website buyer ID pipeline
requiring complete re-architecture due to scalability limitations,
necessitating early Q3 investment in COIN infrastructure for
multi-destination data delivery.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Agent Platform Viability**: Jesse Miller\'s successful migration
demonstrates strong architectural foundation for AI agent development,
with 90% code portability indicating robust design patterns and
technical alignment across development environments.

**Predictive Clearing Value**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s analysis
validates predictive clearing as margin optimization tool, with
successful implementation showing immediate performance improvements
across key metrics while maintaining campaign effectiveness.

**Person-Intent Technical Approach**: Shuxin Yang\'s coordination with
data science team reveals practical path forward for person-level intent
through rule-based scoring, addressing competitive disadvantage while
managing volume scaling challenges.

**Partner Integration Framework**: Anwar Mai\'s partnership discussions
highlight critical need for systematic partner value tracking, both for
revenue optimization and quality assessment of data integrations across
visit data and audience syndication channels.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Agentic Platform team through Lars coordination
continues to be essential for custom reporting agent development, with
Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal advancing setup in VS Code environment for
platform integration.

Partnership integration framework requires coordination with Andres for
repeatable processes, starting with Path Factory implementation as pilot
for systematic partner onboarding and data tracking capabilities.

COIN team collaboration critical for website buyer ID pipeline
re-architecture, with early Q3 timeline requiring careful coordination
for scalable data delivery infrastructure.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on Q3 planning finalization and agent platform
development advancement, with team positioned to leverage established
frameworks for accelerated delivery.

Top priorities include completing Q3 planning with dependency
identification and resource finalization for DSP team initiatives. Agent
development continues with custom reporting agent advancement and
performance optimization through CPA drop analysis resolution. Partner
integration framework implementation begins with Path Factory pilot,
establishing systematic tracking capabilities for partner value
assessment.

The successful agent platform migration demonstrates technical
feasibility for scaled automation capabilities, while predictive
clearing optimization provides immediate margin improvements supporting
continued investment in advanced advertising features. Strong Q3
planning foundation positions team for confident delivery against scoped
priorities.
