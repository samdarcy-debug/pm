# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of August 4, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Major technical milestones achieved with LiveIntent integration
deployment and Notification Center approaching production release, while
strategic partnerships advance through legal and security review phases.
Team delivered 94% goal completion rate with critical infrastructure
improvements positioned for Q3 feature launches. Partnership ecosystem
expansion progresses with Path Factory, Unbounce, and Insightly moving
through formal integration approval processes, while intent support
framework development establishes foundation for improved customer
experience and operational efficiency.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**LiveIntent Integration Launch**: Brett Elliot successfully deployed
LiveIntent integration to production, advancing visitor resolution
capabilities despite infrastructure challenges with website pixel event
pipeline outages. Integration represents continued progress toward
industry-leading identity graph performance with monitoring improvements
identified for next week.

**Notification Center Production Readiness**: Jesse Miller achieved
comprehensive preparation for Notification Center early access launch by
Tuesday, with all third-party channels configured and passing events in
staging environment. Phase 2 CRM and marketing automation integrations
(Marketo, Salesforce) strategically deferred to ensure quality
production deployment.

**Connected TV Product Development**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal completed
Connected TV PRD development while finalizing post-pay API design with
engineering team. Partnership learnings from Unbounce use cases inform
product roadmap development for Q3 video advertising expansion.

**ZIM Agent Development**: Jesse Miller advanced agent demonstration
preparation with engineering team, implementing strategic approach to
start with basic functionality before expanding capabilities. Agent
development shows strong progress with delegation framework established
across Troy, Gabe, and Sigh team members.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Technical Infrastructure**: Brett Elliot completed LiveIntent
deployment with identification of critical monitoring needs for website
pixel event pipeline stability. Infrastructure improvements essential
for accurate visitor resolution rate measurement and platform
reliability.

**Product Documentation**: Matt Barnes achieved 90% completion on four
major PRDs including 5x5 cookie integration, websites buyer ID pipeline,
Adobe Analytics integration, and unified sessions development.
Comprehensive documentation enables Q3 engineering execution across
multiple product areas.

**Partnership Integration**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal progressed website
actions UI development with Connor\'s team while advancing partnership
understanding through Unbounce and Path Factory coordination meetings.

**Intent Support Framework**: Shuxin Yang achieved 70% completion on
intent support process refinement, coordinating with L2 and L3 support
teams (Ryan and Kenny) to establish comprehensive knowledge transfer
protocols and streamline customer issue resolution workflows across
intent pipeline operations.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Infrastructure Monitoring Gaps**: Brett Elliot identified critical
need for enhanced alerting on website pixel event pipeline, with
multiple outages during week impacting accurate performance measurement
for LiveIntent integration assessment.

**Platform Integration Complexity**: Jesse Miller discovered potential
upstream coordination requirements for CRM/marketing automation platform
integrations, requiring evaluation of notification center service
ownership and message synchronization capabilities.

**Partnership Timeline Coordination**: Multiple partnership initiatives
operating on 2-4 week cycles for legal and security reviews, requiring
careful coordination of Path Factory pixel deployment and
Unbounce/Insightly CRM enrichment development.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Partnership Integration Patterns**: Path Factory and Unbounce
partnerships reveal consistent 2-4 week legal and security review cycles
for pixel deployment and data sharing agreements. This establishes
predictable timeline framework for future partnership integrations and
contract negotiation processes.

**Agent Development Philosophy**: Jesse Miller\'s strategic decision to
prioritize basic functionality over complex features demonstrates mature
product development approach, ensuring foundation stability before
expanding capabilities and reducing technical debt risk.

**Infrastructure Reliability Requirements**: Brett Elliot\'s experience
with website pixel pipeline outages highlights critical importance of
comprehensive monitoring and alerting for visitor resolution
infrastructure, particularly as LiveIntent integration scales across
customer base.

**Support Process Coordination**: Shuxin Yang\'s progress on intent
support framework reveals complexity of multi-party coordination
requirements across support levels, emphasizing need for clear ownership
definition and streamlined escalation processes for intent-related
customer issues.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Partnership development requires continued coordination with legal teams
for Path Factory pixel deployment approval and Unbounce/Insightly
security reviews, while Adobe partnership timeline adjustment
necessitates strategic relationship management for destination
integration launch delay.

Platform integration advancement depends on Erica Fienman\'s CRM and
marketing automation platform expertise for Notification Center phase 2
capabilities, ensuring proper upstream integration architecture and
message synchronization protocols.

Infrastructure monitoring improvements require coordination with GCP
operations teams for website pixel event pipeline reliability
enhancement and comprehensive alerting system deployment across visitor
resolution infrastructure.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on production feature launches and partnership
progression, with team positioned to deliver critical customer-facing
capabilities while advancing strategic partnership ecosystem
development.

**Jesse Miller** leads Notification Center early access launch with
comprehensive feature flag deployment and customer onboarding
coordination, while continuing ZIM Agent development and LiveRamp
workflow integration discovery.

**Brett Elliot** advances bidder compliance documentation for legal
review while implementing enhanced monitoring and alerting for website
pixel event pipeline infrastructure reliability improvements.

**Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal** progresses website actions UI development
while coordinating post-pay automation engineering implementation and
Connected TV feature advancement for Q3 delivery.

**Shuxin Yang** continues intent support process optimization with
multi-party coordination across support teams, establishing
comprehensive framework for customer issue resolution and knowledge
transfer protocols.

Partnership ecosystem development advances through scheduled follow-up
meetings with Path Factory (week of August 21st) and Adobe destination
integration timeline coordination following launch date adjustment
communications.

Team maintains strong execution momentum with production feature
launches, infrastructure reliability improvements, and partnership
integration advancement supporting continued platform expansion and
customer value delivery.
