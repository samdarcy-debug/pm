# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of July 21, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Strategic partnership expansion achieved with successful Unbounce CEO
engagement, while critical August release planning establishes clear
go/no-go decisions for customer-facing features. Team delivered 83% goal
completion rate with strong progress on H2 planning and notification
center preparation for early adopter program launch. Data exhaust
strategy breakthrough identified as \"Holy Grail\" opportunity for
bidirectional value creation with integration partners, positioning team
for expanded partner ecosystem development.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Strategic Partnership Development**: Anwar Mai successfully completed
high-level Unbounce integration presentation to CEO and leadership team,
establishing foundation for flywheel vendor partnership that will
enhance identity resolution and intent data through contributory network
expansion. Meeting demonstrated proven integration patterns for visitor
resolution and intent capabilities.

**August Release Clarity**: Matt Barnes delivered comprehensive go/no-go
assessment for August customer releases, with 5x5 IP-to-company data
integration (11% identification improvement) approved for August
deployment. AI Page Rank and bot filtering moved to September release to
ensure quality delivery and proper impact assessment.

**H2 Planning Excellence**: Jesse Miller finalized H2 goals focusing on
feature iteration improvements and ZIM Agent development, positioned for
Workday submission before August 1st deadline. Notification Center
preparation on track for Early Adopter Program launch August 5-19 with
comprehensive enablement materials completed.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Integration Process Documentation**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal completed
comprehensive ISV onboarding process documentation, streamlining future
partner integration workflows and eliminating time waste across team
coordination. Process improvements establish stronger foundation for
scaled partner ecosystem development.

**Compliance Framework Development**: Brett Elliot progressed bidder
compliance planning to 33% completion, systematically cataloguing
browser signals and header request requirements for international ad
delivery compliance. Two additional weeks required for comprehensive
legal submission covering do-not-track signals and bid request
compliance.

**Topic Setup Innovation**: Shuxin Yang achieved 50% completion on Topic
Setup Accelerator roadmap, with foundational exploratory work scheduled
for Q3 execution due to resource priorities. Initiative targets
competitive differentiation in intent topic setup speed versus other GTM
platforms.

**Infrastructure Preparation**: Matt Barnes established LRT process for
approved August releases while identifying AI Page Rank impact
assessment needs for S2A signal processing systems.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Data Exhaust Strategy Gap**: Critical blind spot identified in
bidirectional data flow from partners using ZoomInfo data. Current
inability to receive usage analytics from DSPs, DMPs, and integration
partners limits value realization and funding opportunities for visitor
resolution and intent initiatives.

**Technical Access Constraints**: Matt Barnes experiencing staging
access delays for Admin Portal, creating medium-impact blocker for
Domains and AI Page Rank testing workflows. Multiple team members
affected by provisioning backlog requiring escalation support.

**Resource Allocation Pressures**: Shuxin Yang\'s Topic Setup
Accelerator requires foundational exploratory work that competes with Q3
priorities, highlighting need for strategic resource allocation across
innovation initiatives and operational excellence.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Data Exhaust \"Holy Grail\" Opportunity**: Anwar Mai identified
transformational potential in solving bidirectional data flow
challenges. Establishing pathways to receive usage data from partners
using ZoomInfo audiences would enable identification value delivery
while capturing intent signals and identity enhancement, creating
sustainable funding model for visitor resolution investments.

**Partnership Integration Patterns**: Unbounce engagement demonstrated
repeatable integration patterns applicable across flywheel vendor
ecosystem. Success requires addressing fundamental question of data
ingestion methods - script deployment, visit data ingestion, or web
analytics platform integration - with mandated pathways for value
capture.

**Release Quality Framework**: Matt Barnes\' August release assessment
reveals importance of preliminary forecasting and customer beta testing
for features generating high-volume signal data. AI Page Rank moved to
September with beta option for controlled volume assessment and S2A
impact evaluation.

**Agent Platform Prioritization**: Jesse Miller\'s ZIM Agent becomes top
H2 priority, expanding from AdOps focus to comprehensive solution
incorporating custom reporting use cases, demonstrating platform
approach to automation capabilities.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Unbounce partnership requires systematic integration
process execution, with Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s documented workflows
enabling efficient onboarding and legal pathway establishment through
Beeswax DSP evaluation by July 31st.

Data exhaust strategy development necessitates collaboration across
customer success, legal, and engineering teams to establish mandated
data sharing frameworks with partners using ZoomInfo data for
identification and intent enhancement.

GTM Data Model team coordination essential for Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal\'s
\"plays\" development, requiring alignment on data store architecture
and prioritization frameworks for customer workflow automation.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on H2 goal finalization and ZIM Agent kickoff, with
team positioned to leverage established partnership foundations for
expanded ecosystem development and data exhaust strategy implementation.

Key priorities include completing H2 goal submissions before August 1st
deadline, initiating ZIM Agent development with OPT team coordination,
and advancing LinkedIn end-to-end campaign capabilities discovery
through DeltaX partnership options. Notification Center enters critical
QA and testing phase for Early Adopter Program launch preparation.

Strategic partnership development continues with Adobe release
architecture documentation and Beeswax DSP legal review completion,
while Matt Barnes addresses staging access escalation for August release
testing workflows. Data exhaust strategy development begins with
framework definition for mandated partner data sharing agreements.

Team maintains strong execution momentum with clear release planning,
partnership expansion, and platform capability development supporting
continued investment in visitor resolution and intent data market
leadership.
