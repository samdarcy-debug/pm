# ***ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of October 6, 2025***

## ***Executive Summary***

*Forrester Wave demonstration completed showcasing GTM Studio Workbooks
audience integration to ZIM while retroactive intent deployment delivers
5,000 monthly custom intent topic capacity. Trade Desk budget exceeds
\$3M with potential additional \$3M Q4 spend while October churn reaches
20% requiring attention. Resource reallocation shifts engineers toward
agentic platform work affecting Q4 delivery timelines for Beeswax and
Connected TV as COIN team transitions to direct Global Event Bus
delivery following CDC developer reassignment.*

## ***This Week\'s Progress***

### ***Key Momentum Areas***

*Brett Elliot delivered retroactive intent to internal users following
stakeholder demonstrations and stress testing completion, enabling Josh
Hutchinson\'s custom intent team to reduce setup timelines from 5-10
days to 3-4 days. The system discovered that custom intent topics lack
translation capabilities while uncovering AdX cookie bidding issues
caused by incorrect remote channel ID decoding affecting bidding
accuracy.*

*Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal completed account AI briefs preparation for
Dreamforce demos with delivery targeted for end-of-day Friday supporting
sales team demonstrations. Identity partners onboarding progresses
through Aviran\'s PLG team coordination while custom reporting and
conversion tracking features complete development testing positioning
November GA internal release to CDMs and CSMs.*

*Matt Barnes resolved multiple support and sales requests while
advancing FormComplete data store mapping scheduled for next week with
Sanyog. Website identity data pipeline writes data successfully to
staging environment while CDC status for Global Event Bus delivery
remains unclear following developer reassignment to other priorities.*

### ***Goals & Progress***

***Platform Demonstration**: Anwar Mai coordinated Forrester Wave live
demonstration showcasing GTM Studio Workbooks audience integration to
ZIM alongside comprehensive platform capabilities across 17 analyst
prompts. Trade Desk budget performance exceeds \$3M with potential
additional \$3M spend in Q4 while October churn reaching 20% requires
strategic attention and retention initiatives.*

***Agent Development**: Jesse Miller completed CloudFlare removal
proposal for InfoSec review with Carlos and James while advancing
Notification Center email PRD with milestone-based approach separating
real-time alerts from weekly digest functionality. Agent chat UI
deployment delayed to October 21st production release affecting timeline
for functionality expansion including starter questions and suggestion
nodes.*

***Infrastructure Optimization**: Shuxin Yang unified ALI intent signal
messaging while establishing ranked data science epic prioritization
with Carlos. Retroactive intent stress testing validates 5,000 monthly
topic capacity while audience amplitude analysis reveals FormComplete
creation occurred only 5 times in 360 days highlighting feature adoption
challenges.*

### ***Strategic Challenges***

*Matt Barnes manages substantial support and sales request volume with
approximately half addressable through improved documentation while
remainder requires institutional knowledge recovery from departed
product managers. Adobe troubleshoots ZoomInfo as destination
integration for October 26th release while COIN team transitions to
direct Global Event Bus delivery following Thomas\'s CDC developer
reassignment affecting data flow architecture.*

*Anwar Mai coordinates resource reallocation impact with UX, data, and
DSP engineers shifting to agentic platform work for offerings and
account briefs development. October churn reaching 20% alongside
resource constraints requires strategic prioritization balancing Q4
deliverables including Beeswax integration and Connected TV features
against platform advancement investments.*

*Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal addresses engineering resource transitions with
Narend and Sai moving to other initiatives requiring roadmap review with
Carlos determining feasible Q4 and Q1 2026 delivery scope. CDM and AdOps
requests for feature support may exceed available capacity necessitating
GTM team communication about adjusted timelines.*

## ***Strategic Insights***

### ***Key Learnings & Discoveries***

*Anwar Mai\'s Forrester demonstration showcased GTM Studio Workbooks
audience integration to ZIM highlighting platform convergence strategy
while Trade Desk budget exceeding \$3M with potential additional \$3M Q4
spend demonstrates advertising platform revenue momentum. October churn
reaching 20% requires retention initiative focus alongside resource
optimization strategies.*

*Shuxin Yang\'s retroactive intent analysis discovered production
capabilities supporting topic pausing and archiving workflows applicable
beyond original custom intent acceleration scope. The capacity
improvement to 5,000 monthly topics combined with viability testing
reduction from days to hours enables Josh Hutchinson\'s team to scale
custom intent delivery addressing competitive differentiation
requirements.*

*Matt Barnes uncovered AdX cookie bidding failure caused by incorrect
remote channel ID decoding resulting in years of IP-only bidding using
incomplete three-octet addresses. This technical gap affected targeting
accuracy while Brett Elliot\'s investigation revealed cookie bidding
infrastructure issues requiring immediate remediation for campaign
performance optimization.*

### ***Cross-Team Dependencies***

*Our work with Josh Hutchinson\'s custom intent team benefits from
retroactive intent deployment enabling 5,000 monthly topic capacity
while maintaining quality standards through ongoing multiplier stress
testing validation. Shuxin Yang coordinates launch communication
ensuring process alignment prevents unrealistic customer expectations
about immediate custom intent delivery timelines.*

*Partnership coordination with Aviran\'s PLG team advances identity
partners onboarding through workflow integration while Privado
implementation transitions to manual scanning approach for initial
deployment. FormComplete data store mapping with Sanyog scheduled for
next week following successful website identity data integration
patterns.*

*Agent platform development requires coordination with Ryan Stevens\'
architecture framework while Michael Kelly\'s UI ticket prioritization
enables production testing environment availability. Carlos and James
review CloudFlare removal proposal supporting infrastructure
optimization decisions affecting tag delivery performance.*

## ***Looking Ahead***

*Next week emphasizes roadmap alignment and resource capacity assessment
while maintaining production deployment momentum across multiple
platform capabilities.*

*Anwar Mai leads roadmap finalization with Carlos determining Q4 through
Q1 2026 delivery scope based on available engineering resources
following agentic platform reallocation. Matt Barnes advances AI Page
Rank early access launch while continuing FormComplete data pipeline
mapping and website identity data production deployment. Jesse Miller
progresses agent functionality expansion through starter questions and
suggestion node implementation while proposing CloudFlare removal to
InfoSec and advancing Notification Center email digest discovery.*

*Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal coordinates identity partners onboarding
timeline gathering from dependent teams while advancing GTM Config
offerings QA and agent demonstration recording for Dominik. Custom
reporting and conversion tracking alpha release preparation targets
internal user deployment supporting November GA readiness. Shuxin Yang
focuses on ZIM UX quick wins identification while coordinating workbooks
integration roadmap possibilities and intent data science
prioritization.*

*The team navigates resource constraints requiring strategic
prioritization decisions balancing agentic platform investment against
core advertising and data infrastructure advancement while maintaining
support excellence despite elevated sales and renewal assistance
demands.*
