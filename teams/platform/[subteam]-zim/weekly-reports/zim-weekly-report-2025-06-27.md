# **ZIM Team Executive Roundup - Week of June 27, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Critical infrastructure and customer-facing features delivered despite
strategic pivots and resource constraints. Team achieved 86% goal
completion rate with significant progress on Enhanced Visitor
Identification documentation, video advertising forecasting, and intent
volume scaling. Strategic clarity emerged around ZIM platform investment
priorities following leadership discussions that deprioritized SMB
market and Spark self-serve platform, enabling focused resource
allocation toward mid-market and enterprise segments.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Enhanced Visitor Identification Launch Readiness**: Brett Elliot
successfully completed comprehensive onboarding documentation delivery,
creating streamlined processes for EVI FAQ, WebSights implementation
guides, and ZI script documentation. Process improvements eliminated
dependency on graphic designers and business analysts, enabling direct
PM editing of customer-facing materials.

**Video Advertising Momentum**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal achieved
breakthrough adoption metrics with video ads generating over \$22,000 in
first 5 weeks against \$200,000 annual target, demonstrating strong
market demand. UTM Builder adoption jumped from 64% to 85% within one
week of launch, validating product-market fit for self-service
advertising tools.

**Intent Pipeline Scaling**: Shuxin Yang completed staging testing
framework for intent volume increase, establishing foundation for
addressing volume decay issues affecting key DaaS clients like Ziff
Davis and Deloitte. Coordination with QA and infrastructure teams now
positions pipeline for production augmentation.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Technical Documentation & Process**: Aadhitthyaa Hari Gopal achieved
100% completion on comprehensive JIRA documentation for Custom
Reporting, Website Actions, and Gartner demo requirements. MOS Usage
automation API documentation finalized ahead of engineering lead\'s July
PTO, preventing 3-week development bottleneck.

**Advertising Forecasting**: Jesse Miller delivered 70% completion on
video and international campaign forecasting, with backend
implementation complete but frontend coordination blocked until July 7th
release. LiveRamp partnership discussions advancing toward DMP API
development for expanded data activation.

**Data Infrastructure**: Matt Barnes progressed 5x5 IP-to-company
dataset integration with expected 2.7% improvement in company resolution
accuracy. AI Page Rank prompt optimization underway through customer
interview validation sessions with blind ranking comparisons.

**Strategic Planning**: Anwar Mai achieved 70% completion on Gartner RFI
documentation while investigating Adobe Analytics integration options
through workflow connectors versus native integration approaches.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Platform Strategy Pivot**: Leadership discussions resulted in
deprioritization of Spark self-serve platform due to SMB market
challenges and potential revenue cannibalization concerns. Team must now
refocus resources on mid-market and enterprise segments while
maintaining product innovation momentum.

**Cross-Team Coordination Complexity**: Multiple initiatives requiring
careful dependency management including UI-backend API coordination for
forecasting features, ZDP/CDP pipeline migration, and workflow connector
integration decisions for Adobe Analytics.

**Resource Allocation Under Constraints**: Engineering capacity
limitations affecting timeline coordination, with frontend team approval
delays impacting release schedules and requiring strategic
prioritization of development resources.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Process Optimization Impact**: Brett Elliot\'s documentation process
improvements revealed significant efficiency gains possible through
elimination of multi-step approval chains. Transformation from
PM-PMM-designer-analyst workflow to direct PM editing reduced cycle time
and dependency bottlenecks.

**AI-Driven Product Development**: Matt Barnes\' customer interview
validation of AI Page Rank demonstrates strong potential for AI-assisted
decision making when supported by transparent reasoning. Customer
feedback sessions revealing alignment opportunities between algorithmic
and human judgment.

**Market Validation Through Adoption**: Video advertising and UTM
Builder adoption metrics provide clear evidence of product-market fit,
with 85% adoption rate indicating strong user experience and addressing
genuine customer needs.

**Intent Signal Quality Alignment**: Shuxin Yang identified need for
cross-functional alignment between engineering, product, and data
science teams on AI-based topic classification initiatives, highlighting
importance of coordinated approach to quality improvements.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Data Platform team on ZDP/CDP migration remains
critical for cost optimization and pipeline consolidation. Aadhitthyaa
Hari Gopal\'s coordination with Prateek Paikray successfully identified
field mapping gaps, with Amy now unblocked for completion by July 30th.

Integration with workflow connector teams continues to be essential for
Adobe Analytics integration decisions, with Anwar Mai coordinating with
Andres to determine optimal implementation approach between native
integration and workflow-based solutions.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on production deployment preparation and strategic
alignment following leadership guidance on platform priorities. Team
positioned to leverage shortened holiday week for documentation
completion and planning refinement.

Key priorities include finalizing Forrester ABM RFI documentation,
advancing Adobe Analytics integration architecture decisions, and
completing predictive clearing testing framework for margin
optimization. Jesse Miller will focus on DMP API PRD development and
coordinating July 7th forecasting release deployment, while Shuxin Yang
progresses AI-based topic classification alignment across engineering
and data science teams.

The strategic pivot away from Spark enables concentrated investment in
proven revenue-generating features while maintaining innovation in video
advertising and intent data quality improvements. Team momentum remains
strong with clear market validation supporting continued investment in
ZIM platform capabilities.
