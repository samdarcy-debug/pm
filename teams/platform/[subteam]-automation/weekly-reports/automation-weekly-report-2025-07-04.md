# **Automation Executive Roundup - 7/4/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**Engineering alignment challenges are slowing our extensibility handoff
while GTM Plays requirements remain undefined.** Sam Massie has
completed product requirements and design for the form builder. Marc
Frail was unable to secure time with Adam Smith or Sneh for GTM Plays
alignment during the shortened holiday week. Adam Peretz delivered a
successful PRFAQ through the new PMM Engine tool, setting up proper
customer communications for the July API release.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Adam Peretz successfully navigated the new PMM Engine process**,
completing the PRFAQ for the July ZI API and Developer Portal release.
Despite the process taking several hours and requiring comprehensive
documentation preparation, the output quality exceeded expectations and
ensures appropriate customer and partner communications for this
critical product launch.

**Sam Massie completed all product-side deliverables for form builder
handoff**, finalizing both requirements and design specifications for
the extensibility UI. The work represents a fundamental shift toward
opening ZoomInfo\'s traditionally walled garden approach, though
engineering adoption is proving more complex than anticipated.

**Process improvements emerged from PMM Engine adoption**, with Adam
Peretz discovering that while the new tool requires significant upfront
preparation and time investment, it produces substantially higher
quality marketing materials than previous processes. This learning will
inform future release planning and resource allocation.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Form Builder Extensibility**: Sam Massie achieved partial completion
with all product requirements and design work finished, but engineering
handoff remains incomplete. Omri being on PTO this week contributed to
slower progress, but the core challenge is architectural rather than
resource-based.

**GTM Plays Requirements**: Marc Frail was unable to complete alignment
work due to scheduling conflicts with Adam Smith and Sneh during the
shortened holiday week. The September timeline for GTM Plays makes this
alignment increasingly urgent, as gaps and dependencies analysis cannot
proceed without stakeholder input.

**API Release Marketing**: Adam Peretz completed the PRFAQ process
through the new PMM Engine tool, ensuring proper customer communications
for the July API release. Additional organizational work was completed
this week to prepare materials for finalizing the customer-facing API
documentation.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Engineering architecture assumptions are creating extensibility
friction**, with Team 12 accustomed to working within ZoomInfo\'s
controlled data environment rather than handling diverse API responses.
This represents a fundamental shift from a walled garden approach to
true extensibility, requiring not just new code but new engineering
mindset and architectural patterns.

**GTM Plays timeline compression is creating scheduling pressure**, with
Marc Frail unable to secure necessary stakeholder time during a critical
planning period. The September delivery window leaves little room for
extended alignment cycles, particularly given the upcoming holiday
interruptions to team availability.

**Resource constraints are compounding during holiday period**, with
Omri on PTO affecting engineering progress and Marc Frail out Monday
through Wednesday next week. These scheduling challenges are colliding
with time-sensitive deliverables that require cross-functional
coordination.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Extensibility requires fundamental architectural transformation beyond
feature addition**, as Sam Massie discovered that Team 12\'s current
approach cannot easily accommodate direct API data handling. This
represents a broader platform evolution from controlled internal data
flows to supporting arbitrary external system integration, requiring new
engineering patterns and validation approaches.

**PMM Engine tool delivers quality improvements at the cost of process
complexity**, with Adam Peretz finding that while the new system
requires hours of preparation and comprehensive documentation, it
produces significantly better marketing materials. This suggests
investment in process improvement is paying dividends but requires
adjusted planning timelines.

**Partner schema definition emerges as future requirement**, with Sam
Massie identifying that optional partner-defined schemas for API
responses could enhance the extensibility platform. This capability
would allow partners to specify data types and properties, making
integrations more robust and user-friendly.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Workflow Apps engineering (Team 12) collaboration is essential for form
builder completion, but their current architecture creates impediments
to extensibility goals. The team needs support transitioning from their
existing walled garden approach to handling diverse API data formats.

Adam Smith and Sneh availability is blocking GTM Plays requirements
definition, with Marc Frail unable to secure necessary alignment time.
This dependency becomes more critical as the September timeline
approaches and planning windows narrow.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on overcoming engineering architecture challenges
while advancing GTM Plays planning despite holiday scheduling
constraints.

Sam Massie will begin H2 planning artifact development and map
extensibility backlog, working around his Thursday-Friday PTO schedule.
He will also coordinate with Lars on connector and workflow
discoverability for the agentic platform, expanding the extensibility
vision beyond traditional workflow scenarios.

Marc Frail will continue pursuing GTM Plays alignment with Adam Smith
and Sneh despite being out Monday through Wednesday, recognizing that
this work cannot be delayed further without impacting the September
delivery timeline. Adam Peretz will return to API documentation
finalization, leveraging the organizational work completed this week to
deliver customer-ready materials.

The team faces a critical inflection point where engineering
architecture decisions will determine the speed and scope of
extensibility delivery, while GTM Plays requirements definition will
shape the strategic direction of the entire automation platform.
