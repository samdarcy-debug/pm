# **Automation Executive Roundup - 11/21/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**Data connector forms reach staging while product taxonomy
challenges.** Sam Massie achieved data connector forms deployment to
staging with December 8 target for forms and flexible field mapping,
though jury duty starting this week will constrain capacity. Marc Frail
successfully demoed website visitor trigger with buyer ID but requires
production changes before release, while publishing connector library
documentation and identifying enhancement needs. Adam Peretz\'s
analytics dashboard encountered unexplained data discrepancies requiring
resolution, while execution discussions revealed the need for
company-wide product taxonomy reorganization to better align with
customer problem-solving workflows.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Sam Massie delivered data connector forms to staging environment**,
achieving a milestone toward December 8 delivery of forms and step
configuration with flexible field mapping. This represents tangible
progress on the Clay-like interactive experience that enables more
sophisticated user interactions with enrichment flows.

**Marc Frail successfully demonstrated website visitor trigger with
buyer ID**, showcasing end-to-end Global Event Bus flows despite needing
minor production changes. Additionally, connector library documentation
was published, enabling customer reference materials for the
22-connector ecosystem launched in previous weeks.

**Product taxonomy reorganization identified as company-wide need**,
with Adam Peretz and Ron Bailey beginning collaboration on structuring
product offerings based on customer problems and workflows rather than
technical implementation details. This foundational work affects API and
service organization across the entire company.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Data Connector Forms Advancement**: Sam Massie progressed data
connector forms to staging with December 8 target for complete forms and
flexible field mapping delivery. However, jury duty beginning this week
creates capacity constraints affecting near-term velocity.

**Website Visitor Tracking**: Marc Frail achieved partial completion
with successful buyer ID trigger demos, though production release
requires additional changes. Connector library documentation completion
enables customer adoption of enrichment capabilities.

**Analytics Infrastructure**: Adam Peretz made partial progress with all
necessary dashboard data now available, but unexplained data
discrepancies prevent considering the work complete. The primary data
source knowledge owner was out all week, limiting resolution progress.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Current connector implementation limits user flexibility**, with Marc
Frail identifying that existing enrichment flows only allow mapping
columns to input fields without supporting ad hoc user inputs. This
limitation prevents Clay-like interactive experiences where users
provide values inline rather than requiring all inputs to exist as
audience data columns. This is planned to be solved for with the release
of forms on actions and replacing the current experiences.

**Data accuracy concerns delay dashboard launch**, as Adam Peretz cannot
finalize analytics capabilities while unexplained discrepancies exist in
the data. The team prioritizes accuracy over speed, refusing to release
dashboards that may mislead resource allocation decisions.

**Product taxonomy complexity affects entire organization**, with
execution discussions revealing that products and services lack coherent
structure aligned to customer problem-solving. While initially surfacing
through API documentation needs, the challenge extends company-wide and
requires collaborative resolution across teams.

**Jury duty creates capacity constraints during delivery phase**, with
Sam Massie\'s availability limited starting this week as forms and
flexible field mapping approach December 8 target date. The timing
affects ability to drive engineering coordination and address emerging
issues.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Forms architecture enables Clay-like interaction patterns**, with Marc
Frail recognizing that replacing current connector UI with forms living
on actions creates more interactive user experiences. This architectural
shift moves from pure data mapping to supporting ad hoc inputs that
don\'t require pre-existing audience column data.

**Product categorization affects customer comprehension and adoption**,
as Adam Peretz\'s taxonomy work reveals that organizing offerings by
technical implementation rather than customer problems creates
comprehension barriers. Reorganizing around solutions and workflows
addresses issues affecting company-wide customer experience.

**Data governance requires primary knowledge ownership**, with Adam
Peretz\'s analytics work highlighting risks when primary data source
expertise isn\'t accessible. The vacation-related delay demonstrates
dependency on individual knowledge rather than systematized
understanding.

**Staging deployment demonstrates delivery momentum**, as Sam Massie\'s
forms reaching staging environment shows concrete progress toward
December 8 targets despite upcoming capacity constraints from jury duty.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Ron Bailey collaboration is essential for product taxonomy work, with
Adam Peretz partnering to develop API and service categorization that
can serve as model for broader company-wide reorganization.

Engineering coordination remains critical for Marc Frail\'s no-code
enhancement planning, with meetings scheduled next week to review
priorities and develop implementation plans.

Design team engagement needed for Sam Massie\'s function builder work,
though jury duty may limit capacity for deep collaboration during
Thanksgiving week.

## **Looking Ahead**

Thanksgiving week creates shortened timelines while product taxonomy and
analytics accuracy take priority alongside no-code enhancement planning.

Marc Frail will review no-code enhancements with engineering and
collaborate on implementation plans, balancing enhancement priorities
against GTM Plays requirements and resource availability during
holiday-shortened week.

Adam Peretz will attempt to resolve dashboard data discrepancies in the
shortened week, working with the returning data source expert to explain
inconsistencies and ensure accuracy before finalizing analytics
capabilities. He will also begin organizing data for global product
taxonomy in collaboration with Ron Bailey.

Sam Massie will engage with the design team on function builder designs
if time permits during jury duty, managing limited availability while
maintaining momentum toward December 8 forms and flexible field mapping
delivery.

The convergence of forms reaching staging, product taxonomy recognition,
and no-code enhancement planning creates foundation for sophisticated
automation capabilities, but jury duty constraints and holiday timing
require careful prioritization of essential activities over ambitious
scope expansion.
