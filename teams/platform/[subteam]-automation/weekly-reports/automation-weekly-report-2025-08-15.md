# **Automation Executive Roundup - 8/15/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**Strategic pivot from GTM Plays to Workbook-Workflow activation
accelerates value delivery while penetration testing delays threaten MCP
launch timeline.** Marc Frail successfully navigated a fundamental
strategy shift following the Plays PRD review, pivoting from creating
new GTM Plays functionality to focusing on activating existing Workbooks
with Workflows to unlock value more quickly. Adam Peretz launched ReadMe
documentation to overwhelmingly positive feedback but discovered that
penetration testing requirements could delay MCP production launch until
end of September. Sam Massie achieved 67% completion on action library
alignment but faces design decision bottlenecks and accelerated October
timeline pressure.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Marc Frail led successful strategic realignment**, achieving complete
goal delivery by facilitating the pivot from GTM Plays creation to
Workbook activation through Workflows. The Plays PRD review provided
essential transparency that enabled the team to align on a new direction
focused on unlocking immediate value rather than building new
capabilities from scratch.

**Adam Peretz delivered ReadMe documentation launch with strong market
reception**, completing documentation deployment and feedback collection
to overwhelmingly positive customer response. The new documentation
portal represents a significant improvement in partner and customer
experience, directly addressing the documentation gaps that have been
hampering API adoption.

**Workflow architecture decisions gained clarity through design
collaboration**, with Sam Massie making substantial progress on action
and trigger library vision despite UX/UI resource constraints. The work
establishes critical frameworks for how ZoomInfo-managed integrations
will appear as workflow actions, building toward the extensibility goals
that support both current and future automation scenarios.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Strategic Pivot Execution**: Marc Frail completed 100% of scope
narrowing work, successfully updating JIRA priorities to align with M1
use cases focused on Workbook-Workflow activation rather than GTM Plays
creation. This pivot maintains strategic momentum while choosing a path
that leverages existing capabilities for faster value delivery.

**Documentation and Optimization**: Adam Peretz completed ReadMe launch
and feedback documentation, identifying significant optimizations needed
for the \"Try it now\" widget. ReadMe\'s limitation around PII key
exchange requires a workaround involving developer portal token
generation, creating a more cumbersome but functional authentication
flow for API testing.

**Action Library Framework**: Sam Massie achieved 67% completion on GTM
Plays action and trigger library alignment, making progress on workflow
app UX/UI decisions and processes for publishing internal ZoomInfo
actions. Progress was limited by UX/UI resource bottlenecks and key
stakeholder Andres being on vacation for half the week.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Penetration testing timeline threatens MCP production launch**, with
end of September target representing a 4-week delay from Adam Peretz\'s
preferred timeline. The testing requirement is non-negotiable for
production deployment, forcing difficult decisions about demo
capabilities versus full launch readiness for the board presentation.

**October release timeline acceleration pressures design completion**,
with the major release moving up from December requiring scope trimming
and accelerated design finalization. Sam Massie must balance quality
with speed while managing limited UX/UI resources and stakeholder
availability constraints.

**Data mapping complexity extends beyond new workflow steps**, as Sam
Massie discovered that the new data mapping UI must also accommodate
existing workflow steps. This represents additional scope that wasn\'t
initially anticipated but is necessary for platform consistency and user
experience continuity.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Workbook-Workflow activation provides faster value path than GTM Plays
creation**, with the strategic pivot recognizing that immediate value
can be unlocked through existing capabilities rather than building new
platform features. This approach reduces development risk while
maintaining long-term extensibility vision.

**ReadMe authentication limitations require creative workarounds**, as
the platform\'s lack of PII key exchange support prevents direct API
testing links. The developer portal token generation workaround
maintains functionality but adds friction to the customer experience,
highlighting the importance of platform selection for developer tools.

**Timeline compression from December to October demands scope
discipline**, requiring careful prioritization to ensure core
functionality delivery while maintaining quality standards. The
acceleration reflects market pressure but creates execution risk if
scope isn\'t managed carefully.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Workflow Apps engineering focus on micro front end completion is
essential for maintaining current development momentum while new data
mapping designs are finalized. Sam Massie\'s parallel approach enables
continued progress without blocking current work streams.

Brett Jacobs and Ken Elwell coordination continues for MCP internal
enablement, with demonstration materials and documentation becoming more
critical as production readiness activities intensify.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week balances strategic pivot implementation with accelerated
delivery timelines while managing penetration testing constraints that
could impact launch schedules.

Marc Frail will restructure planning and requirements based on the
Workbook-Workflow activation focus, abandoning GTM Plays creation work
in favor of maximizing value from existing capabilities. Sam Massie will
maintain engineering focus on micro front end completion while
finalizing data mapping designs for engineering handoff, working within
the compressed October timeline.

Adam Peretz will advance MCP server toward production readiness despite
penetration testing timeline constraints, potentially requiring
difficult conversations about demo capabilities versus full production
launch. The strategic pivot creates opportunity to deliver meaningful
automation value more quickly, but execution discipline will be
essential to meet the accelerated October timeline while maintaining
quality standards that support long-term platform success.
