# **Automation Executive Roundup - 7/11/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**GTM Plays alignment breakthrough unlocks structured planning while
authentication blockers threaten broader API strategy.** Marc Frail
successfully secured high-level alignment on workflow integration with
GTM Plays, establishing clear workstreams and shifting the December
timeline into actionable planning phases. Adam Peretz is 90% complete on
customer-facing API documentation but faces persistent procurement
delays with ReadMe and emerging authentication challenges that could
impact MCP and other strategic initiatives. Sam Massie\'s GTM Plays
mapping work was deferred due to PTO scheduling.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Marc Frail achieved critical GTM Plays alignment breakthrough**,
securing stakeholder commitment and establishing three parallel
workstreams: engineering research on Google Workflow versus Temporal,
technical gap analysis with Lars, and use case prioritization with Sneh
and Veronica. This represents a fundamental shift from blocked
requirements gathering to structured execution planning with clear
ownership.

**Adam Peretz reached 90% completion on customer-facing API
documentation**, positioning the team to finally provide partners with
current, usable documentation instead of the outdated materials
currently causing integration friction. Work-in-progress documentation
has already been shared with existing partners to unblock their
development efforts.

**Authentication challenges surfaced as a strategic blocker**, with Adam
Peretz identifying that authentication issues are impacting not just
ReadMe procurement but also MCP work and potentially other API
initiatives. This systemic challenge requires executive attention to
prevent broader platform delays.

### **Goals & Progress**

**GTM Plays Integration**: Marc Frail completed high-level alignment
work, establishing clear integration points between workflows and GTM
Plays. The December timeline is now supported by structured workstreams
with defined owners, moving from aspirational to actionable. Engineering
will research workflow execution platforms while technical teams conduct
gap analysis and product teams prioritize use cases.

**API Documentation**: Adam Peretz achieved 90% completion on
customer-facing documentation for 12 endpoints including Contact,
Company, News, Scoops, Intent, Usage, and Lookup capabilities. The
remaining 10% should be completed by end of day, finally providing
partners with current documentation instead of outdated materials that
require constant one-off support.

**GTM Plays Mapping**: Sam Massie\'s work to map data connector and
action milestones to GTM Plays requirements was not started due to
Thursday-Friday PTO scheduling. This work remains essential for ensuring
extensibility deliverables align with the broader GTM Plays vision.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Authentication architecture is creating systemic blockers across
multiple initiatives**, with Adam Peretz identifying that authentication
issues are impacting ReadMe procurement, MCP development, and
potentially other API projects. This suggests a fundamental platform
challenge rather than isolated integration problems, requiring
coordinated resolution across legal, procurement, and engineering teams.

**Procurement delays continue to hamper partner enablement**, with
ReadMe integration still stalled in legal review despite escalation to
leadership. The extended procurement cycle is preventing improved
documentation tooling that would reduce partner onboarding friction and
internal support burden.

**New SKU requirements are adding complexity to API strategy**, with
Adam Peretz needing to support two new SKUs that separate increased API
limits from the expensive Scaling API bundle. This requires engineering
coordination to ensure proper implementation while maintaining existing
API functionality.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**GTM Plays workflow integration requires orchestration platform
decision**, with engineering now researching Google Workflow versus
Temporal to support the complex automation scenarios envisioned for GTM
Plays. This technical architecture decision will influence both current
workflow capabilities and future extensibility options.

**Authentication emerges as a cross-cutting platform concern**,
requiring dedicated attention from Marc Frail and Ali to resolve
blockers affecting multiple strategic initiatives. The authentication
challenge appears to be architectural rather than
implementation-specific, suggesting need for systematic resolution.

**API monetization strategy is evolving toward granular SKUs**, with new
offerings allowing customers to purchase increased API limits without
the full Scaling API bundle. This represents a shift toward more
flexible API pricing that could improve adoption while maintaining
revenue goals.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Workflow integration with GTM Plays now has clear cross-functional
ownership, with Lars supporting technical gap analysis and Sneh and
Veronica leading use case prioritization. This represents improved
coordination compared to previous weeks\' scheduling conflicts.

Engineering coordination is essential for both new SKU implementation
and workflow platform research, with Adam Peretz needing support for API
limit management and Marc Frail requiring input on orchestration
platform capabilities.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on converting GTM Plays alignment into concrete
deliverables while resolving authentication blockers that threaten
broader API strategy execution.

Marc Frail will continue building the prioritized milestone list for GTM
Plays workflows with t-shirt sized estimates, leveraging the alignment
achieved this week to create actionable planning artifacts. Adam Peretz
will complete the final 10% of API documentation and coordinate with
engineering on new SKU planning, while scheduling meetings with Marc and
Ali to address authentication challenges systematically.

The authentication discussion represents a potential inflection point
for the entire API strategy, as resolving these blockers could unlock
multiple stalled initiatives including ReadMe procurement, MCP
development, and partner integration improvements. Meanwhile, the GTM
Plays momentum creates opportunity to demonstrate workflow value at
scale if technical execution can match the strategic alignment achieved
this week.
