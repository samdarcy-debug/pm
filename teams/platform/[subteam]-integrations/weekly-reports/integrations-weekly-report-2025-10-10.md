# **Integrations Team Executive Roundup - October 6, 2025**

Prateek Paikray delivered full Agentforce functionality, training, and
materials for Dreamforce. Sanyog Rai completed a customer self-service
frontend prototype for configuring GTM Engagement-sourced Account,
Contact, Account Team Role record creation - additionally, 16 tenants
are now importing recording data into GTM Meetings (all customers have
calendar data already flowing to GTM Meetings). Use case documentation
started to ensure all ZI teams comply with new deadline of Jan 31, 2026
to read CRM and Engagement data only from GTM DM via API. Additionally,
HPE feedback highlighting features we must introduce into new products
around RBAC and Credit charging simplification.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Prateek Paikray delivered comprehensive Agentforce capabilities
including functionality, training materials, and documentation for
Dreamforce presentation. This complete package positions ZoomInfo to
showcase enterprise AI capabilities at the industry\'s premier event,
demonstrating our platform\'s readiness for large-scale customer
adoption and partner engagement.

Sanyog Rai completed a working frontend prototype specifically for
customer self-service configuration of GTM Engagement-sourced Account,
Contact, and Account Team Role record creation. This targeted solution
addresses customer requests for direct control over engagement data
integration workflows, with recordings functionality on for 16 tenants
and expected to fulyl deploy pending final approvals next week.

The team initiated comprehensive use case documentation to prepare for
the January 31, 2026 compliance deadline requiring all ZoomInfo teams to
access CRM and Engagement data exclusively through GTM Data Manager
APIs. This foundational work ensures smooth transition away from legacy
data access patterns while maintaining operational continuity across the
organization.

### **Goals & Progress**

**GTM AI Context Service**: Prateek Paikray achieved complete delivery
of Agentforce functionality, training materials, and Dreamforce
presentation assets, exceeding H2 objectives by providing a
comprehensive enablement package. This milestone creates significant
opportunity for ZoomInfo to demonstrate AI leadership at the industry\'s
most visible platform event.

**GTM Platform & GTM Studio**: Sanyog Rai\'s frontend prototype
specifically targets GTM Engagement-sourced record creation workflows
that customers need for Account, Contact, and Account Team Role
management. The auto-custom-field creation POC advances despite tool
integration obstacles, while use case documentation begins addressing
the organization-wide compliance requirements for API-only data access.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Agentic Team (shoutout Ryan Stevens) are extremely responsive and always
available for help, but working with the agentic platform has been
difficult to troubleshoot hallucination issues and API tool call
failures, even once onboarded to the LangSmith debugging terminal.

Legacy product support issues and limitations driving dozens of
implementation projects where customers are turning off data access
(Zoom going to turn on CRM Import, but limit objects) and HPE turning
off Opportunities). Lots of time spent solving for enterprise use cases
with products that were not enterprise-optimized is creating a drain on
product management capacity.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

HPE customer feedback is driving new product feature requirements around
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and credit charging simplification that
must be built into upcoming product releases. These aren\'t fixes to
existing limitations but new capabilities that enterprise customers
require for successful platform adoption, requiring careful product
roadmap integration and resource allocation.

The January 31, 2026 compliance deadline for GTM Data Manager API-only
access represents a fundamental shift in how ZoomInfo teams consume CRM
and Engagement data. Early documentation efforts reveal the complexity
of migrating existing workflows and the need for comprehensive change
management across product, engineering, and customer-facing teams.

Customer self-service configuration capabilities for GTM
Engagement-sourced data workflows address specific pain points in
Account, Contact, and Account Team Role management. Sanyog Rai\'s
prototype demonstrates that targeted automation reduces operational
overhead while giving customers direct control over their data
integration processes.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our partnership with the Agentic Platform team remains essential for
resolving tool integration debugging challenges in GTM Studio field
mapping agent. The current API tracing limitations require dedicated
technical collaboration to establish proper error visibility and
resolution protocols.

The organization-wide shift to GTM Data Model API-only access by January
31, 2026 requires coordination across product, engineering, and
operations teams. Use case documentation efforts must accelerate to
identify all current data access patterns and plan migration strategies
for each affected workflow.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on advancing GTM Data Manager field agent capabilities
while establishing Partner OEM WebResearch timelines with Carlos and
developing deprecation strategies for legacy data access methods in
preparation for the January 2026 compliance deadline.

Sanyog Rai will advance Account Creation work following successful
frontend prototype reviews with platform leadership, while the team
accelerates use case documentation to support organization-wide API
migration planning. Priority includes defining new RBAC and credit
management features that HPE feedback indicates are essential for
enterprise product adoption.

The Integrations team demonstrates strong execution with Prateek
Paikray\'s comprehensive Dreamforce deliverables and Sanyog Rai\'s
targeted self-service capabilities, while taking on the significant
responsibility of leading organization-wide compliance preparation for
the fundamental shift in data access architecture.
