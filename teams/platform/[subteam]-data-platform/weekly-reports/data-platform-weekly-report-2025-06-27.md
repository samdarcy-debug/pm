# **Data Platform Team Executive Roundup - Week of 6/23/25**

## **Executive Summary**

**Critical architectural alignment achieved on unified API strategy.**
Marc Delurgio secured leadership buy-in to pivot from Advanced Search to
Conversational Search, while Linda Johannessen navigated complex
cross-team dependencies to establish the foundational architecture for
GTM data consumption. Adwait Kirtikar advanced Unified Profile
initiative with confirmed Design and UI Engineering team commitments,
positioning us to deliver enterprise-grade data unification capabilities
by Q4. Menna Rashwan successfully redefined Enterprise Search milestones
to decouple from Q4 Metadata Registry dependencies, enabling near-term
delivery.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Strategic Product Direction Locked:** Marc Delurgio achieved
leadership alignment with Darrell on prioritizing Conversational Search
over Advanced Search investments. This decision eliminates resource
fragmentation and positions the team to deliver contemporary user
experiences that solve existing usability issues while preventing
disruption by upstart competitors.

**Cross-Team Architecture Breakthrough:** Linda Johannessen facilitated
critical alignment across Search and GTM Store on unified API approach.
Despite initial complexity, the team achieved 80% confidence in next
week\'s final decision, with Frank and Thomas committed to delivering
high-level architecture documentation and timing on 7/8.

**Enterprise Foundation Secured:** Adwait Kirtikar secured commitments
from both UI Engineering (Nebo team) and Design (Meghan C) teams to
allocate bandwidth for Unified Profile UI, although timing with
engineering vs other priorities is tbd. This removes a critical
dependency blocker for Unified Profile MVP delivery.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Enterprise Search & Unified APIs**: Menna Rashwan successfully
redefined Enterprise Search milestones to decouple from Q4 Metadata
Registry dependencies, enabling near-term delivery. The team navigated
complex architectural discussions to establish system boundaries between
federated search and direct query approaches, with final architecture
review scheduled for next Thursday. Current status shows 80% confidence
in locking down integration decisions next week.

**Unified Profile Initiative**: Adwait Kirtikar completed critical
stakeholder alignment for Milestone 1, securing Design and UI
Engineering team commitments for survivorship logic configuration and UI
integration deliverables. Next week focuses on engaging internal
operations teams as first customers to validate early thinking and
incorporate insights into product requirements.

**Conversational Search Pivot**: Marc Delurgio achieved leadership
buy-in from Darrell to focus resources on Conversational Search while
minimizing Advanced Search investments. Follow-up required on specific
Advanced Search roadmap items, with proposal to incorporate necessary
features into Conversational Search architecture rather than maintaining
parallel development streams.

## **Strategic Challenges**

**Architectural Complexity Surfaced Mid-Stream:** The team discovered
deeper questions about interface responsibility, system boundaries, and
the vision for a Unified Query API during Query API architecture
discussions.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Platform Architecture Requires Top-Down Vision:** Ali Sadat\'s
reflection revealed that too many parallel technical directions with
bottom-up focus created alignment challenges. The team learned that
Query API requirements need general agreement on high-level requirements
and vision among platform PMs and engineering leaders before diving into
technical implementation details.

**Unified Profile as Internal Customer Validation:** Adwait Kirtikar\'s
approach to treat internal operations teams as first customers of
Unified Profile provides a validation framework for enterprise features.
This strategy allows the team to validate early thinking and incorporate
operational insights before external customer rollout.

**Architectural Decisions Enable Speed:** Menna Rashwan emphasized that
getting conversational search alignment unlocked will significantly help
enterprise search work, enabling the team to focus on new UI rather than
incremental search improvements. This demonstrates how strategic product
decisions create compound effects across multiple initiatives.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Search team on unified API architecture remains
critical for Workbooks data consumption and broader GTM data strategy.
Linda Johannessen is coordinating final architecture review with Frank
(GTM/ZDP metadata engineering lead) and Thomas, with cross-team
alignment meeting scheduled for 7/8. Success depends on resolving
ownership questions between federated search and Query API approaches.

Design and UI Engineering team commitments secured by Adwait Kirtikar
for Unified Profile work represent a significant cross-functional win.
Nebo team (UI Engineering) and Meghan C\'s Design team have committed to
the project, although timing and prioritization across other roadmap
items with engineering is still pending .

## **Looking Ahead**

**Next week focuses on locking in architectural decisions and
accelerating execution across all three major initiatives.**

Linda Johannessen targets final integration decision for Workbooks and
downstream GTM data consumers, with architecture proposal review and
feature-level support mapping by interface. Marc Delurgio and Menna
Rashwan will collaborate on the Conversational Search one-pager with Al
and subsequent product review with leadership. Adwait Kirtikar begins
engaging internal operations teams as Unified Profile\'s first
customers, treating internal users as validation partners for
enterprise-grade data unification capabilities.

The team is positioned to deliver significant value in Q3 with clear
architectural foundations, confirmed cross-team commitments, and
strategic product direction alignment. Success metrics include final API
architecture decisions, Conversational Search product review completion,
and Unified Profile internal customer validation framework
establishment.
