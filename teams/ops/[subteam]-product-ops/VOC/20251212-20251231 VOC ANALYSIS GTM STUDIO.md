# VOICE OF CUSTOMER ANALYSIS: GTM STUDIO

**Analysis Period**: December 12, 2025 \- December 31, 2025   
**Report Date**: December 31, 2025

## WHAT CAME UP THIS WEEK \- KEY HIGHLIGHTS

📈 BIGGEST SHIFTS: 

* User adoption concerns reached 92% of calls \- THE overwhelming friction point blocking deals   
* Missing features/product gaps at 84% \- customers encountering concrete capability limitations  
* AI-Powered Intelligence resonated in 89% of calls \- core value prop remains strong   
* Conversation Intelligence integration requested by 58% (up from 50% last period) \- demand intensifying

🎯 TOP EMERGING PATTERN: Clay competitive pressure persists at 26% of calls, down slightly from 51% peak last period but remaining a significant evaluation factor. Customers continue positioning Clay as the flexibility/affordability benchmark.

🚨 MOST IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS:

1. User adoption concerns (92%) \- "will anyone actually use this?" dominates every conversation  
2. Missing features (84%) \- concrete gaps blocking deployments, not edge cases  
3. Integration complexity (63%) \- technical implementation remains major barrier  
4. Conversation Intelligence integration (58% requesting) \- now THE most requested feature

💡 KEY INSIGHT: The gap between resonance (89% love AI capabilities) and friction (92% question adoption) reveals a fundamental disconnect: customers WANT the product but don't believe their sellers will USE it. This is a positioning/workflow problem, not a feature problem.

## SECTION 1: WHAT WE LEARNED

### ✅ WHAT'S RESONATING (Ranked by Frequency)

#### RANK \#1: AI-Powered Intelligence & Natural Language Query Capabilities

Mentioned in 55 of 62 calls (89%) **Trend:** → Stable from 18% last period (note: different measurement methodology)

The ability to use natural language prompts to analyze data and generate insights resonates overwhelmingly across calls. Customers appreciate that Studio's AI can process complex queries without requiring technical SQL knowledge or manual analysis. The AI agent functionality for generating account plans, persona-specific messaging, and buying committee identification generates enthusiasm among technically sophisticated customers.

Key themes in customer feedback: • Natural language queries eliminate need for SQL or technical analysis • AI processes complex data questions conversationally • Account plan generation and persona-specific messaging automation • Buying committee identification through AI analysis • Removes technical burden from operations teams

Example from Curitec: The AI-powered natural language query capability strongly resonated, with the customer recognizing how it could replace their current manual process of pulling data through complex queries. They expressed clear excitement about the ability to ask questions conversationally rather than building reports, stating this would dramatically reduce the technical burden on their team.

#### RANK \#2: Time Savings & Efficiency at Scale

Mentioned in 28 of 62 calls (45%) **Trend:** → Stable from 27% last period

The ability to automate previously manual processes and operate at scale continues to resonate. Customers value eliminating repetitive research tasks and reducing time spent on data preparation. The efficiency gains enable scaling without proportional headcount increases.

Key themes: • Automating manual data preparation and research • Operating at scale without proportional resource growth • Eliminating repetitive tasks that consume seller time • Enabling operations teams to support larger sales orgs efficiently

Example from Citizens Financial Group: The time savings and scale efficiency messaging landed strongly with the operations team currently drowning in manual data preparation work. They expressed frustration with their current process requiring hours of manual work to prepare target lists, and the ability to automate this at scale was the primary value proposition that resonated.

Also seen with: Vanguard Renewables, Keeper, Orolabs.ai, TextUs, Safe Security, Ibisworld, Perfect Corp., Cyera, Sunstate Equipment, QIMA, Exactera, CoreTrust, Resilinc, Netwrix Corp., Donnelley Financial, Schneider, Quest Resource, Merkle, Horizon BCBS NJ, Criteria Corp., Russell Investments, Datarobot Inc., Nextiva, Intuit, RelaDyne, Ankura Consulting, Frost Bank, Infor

#### RANK \#3: Multi-Source Data Integration

Mentioned in 27 of 62 calls (44%) **Trend:** ↑ Increasing from 43% last period

The ability to pull data from Salesforce, Snowflake, ZoomInfo, intent providers, and other sources into a single workbook resonates strongly. Customers value avoiding vendor lock-in and leveraging existing data investments. This represents Studio's key architectural differentiation.

Key themes: • Avoiding vendor lock-in by supporting multiple data sources • Leveraging existing investments in Snowflake, Salesforce, intent platforms • Unified workbook aggregating disparate data sources • Flexibility to bring your own data vs. single-vendor dependency

Example from Frost Bank: The multi-source data integration capability addressed their core challenge of data fragmentation. Aaron and Ashley repeatedly emphasized their struggle with disparate systems and the need to unify data from Salesforce, their proprietary underwriting systems, and ZoomInfo into a single operational layer. The ability to bring together these sources without complex ETL processes resonated as a major efficiency unlock.

Also seen with: Keeper, Orolabs.ai, TextUs, Fox Corp., Silverfort, Safe Security, Ibisworld, ADP \- Sales, Perfect Corp., Cyera, QIMA, Exactera, CoreTrust, Cleanwater1, Netwrix Corp., G2, Schneider, Merkle, Horizon BCBS NJ, Russell Investments, Datarobot Inc., Nextiva, FM Systems, Ankura Consulting, Citizens Financial, Coretelligent, Verkada

RANK \#4 (TIE): Orchestration & Workflow Automation

Mentioned in 26 of 62 calls (42%) **Trend:** → Stable from 27% last period

The ability to build audiences in Studio and push them to sellers or activate sequences continues to resonate. Operations teams value the capability to orchestrate plays and distribute curated lists without requiring manual handoffs.

Key themes: • Building sophisticated audiences and pushing to sellers • Orchestrating plays without manual distribution • Automating workflow handoffs from ops to sales • Pre-packaged list distribution with contextual guidance

Example from Merkle: The centralized data aggregation concept resonated with the team currently managing multiple point solutions across their tech stack. They expressed strong interest in consolidating their disparate data sources into unified workbooks where they could orchestrate campaigns and distribute curated lists to sellers without manual handoffs.

Also seen with: Vanguard Renewables, Orolabs.ai, TextUs, Safe Security, Ibisworld, Perfect Corp., Cyera, Sunstate Equipment, QIMA, Exactera, CoreTrust, Netwrix Corp., Donnelley Financial, Schneider, Quest Resource, Merkle, Horizon BCBS NJ, Criteria Corp., Russell Investments, Datarobot Inc., Ankura Consulting, Citizens Financial, Coretelligent, Verkada, Infor, Preveil LLC

RANK \#4 (TIE): Data Enrichment Capabilities

Mentioned in 26 of 62 calls (42%) **Trend:** ↑ Increasing from 7% last period (note: different measurement)

The ability to enrich existing CRM records with ZoomInfo data and append missing fields resonates across calls. Customers value filling gaps in their contact and company data without manual research. This remains a table-stakes capability that customers expect.

Key themes: • Filling gaps in CRM contact and company data • Automated enrichment at scale vs. manual research • Appending missing fields without seller intervention • Data quality improvement through enrichment

Example from Compass Group Canada: The credit-saving functionality that recognized previously exported records and only charged for 808 new contacts instead of the full 1,959 particularly resonated. The website visitor aggregation capability generated immediate enthusiasm, with the customer calling it a "game changer" as it addressed a long-standing request to see all website visitors at scale.

Also seen with: Vanguard Renewables, Keeper, TextUs, Safe Security, Ibisworld, ADP \- Sales, Perfect Corp., QIMA, Exactera, CoreTrust, Redo, Cleanwater1, Netwrix Corp., Donnelley Financial, Schneider, Quest Resource, Merkle, Horizon BCBS NJ, Russell Investments, Nextiva, Intuit, RelaDyne, Ankura Consulting, Citizens Financial, Coretelligent, Infor

#### RANK \#6: Data Aggregation & Unified Workspace Concept

Mentioned in 13 of 62 calls (21%) **Trend:** ↓ Decreasing from 26% last period

The "single pane of glass" positioning and ability to consolidate data from multiple sources (ZoomInfo, Salesforce, Snowflake, intent signals, technographics) into unified workbooks continues to resonate but at reduced frequency. The decrease suggests customers are more focused on specific AI capabilities than general consolidation benefits.

Key themes: • Single pane of glass eliminating tool sprawl • Unified view of account intelligence • Consolidating multiple point solutions • Eliminating need to toggle between platforms

Example from Merkle: The centralized data aggregation concept resonated with Merkle's team managing multiple point solutions across their tech stack. They expressed strong interest in consolidating disparate data sources into unified workbooks where they could orchestrate campaigns.

Also seen with: Orolabs.ai, Safe Security, Ibisworld, CompuGroup Medical, Sunstate Equipment, CoreTrust, Netwrix Corp., Schneider, Merkle, Russell Investments, Datarobot Inc., Frost Bank

#### RANK \#7: Conversation Intelligence Integration for Semantic Analysis

Mentioned in 12 of 62 calls (19%) **Trend:** ↓ Decreasing from 50% last period (note: was feature request, now resonance)

The ability to integrate with conversation intelligence platforms (Gong, Chorus) and perform semantic analysis of call transcripts to extract competitive mentions, pain points, and buying signals generates interest. However, this appears more often as a feature request than current capability resonance.

Key themes: • Semantic analysis of call transcripts at scale • Extracting competitive mentions from conversations • Identifying pain points and objections patterns • Surface buying signals from sales calls

Example from Cribl.io: Customer expressed strong interest in pulling call transcript data from Gong into Studio workbooks to analyze patterns across customer conversations. They want to identify which competitors are being mentioned, what objections are surfacing, and which messaging resonates \- all at scale rather than manually reviewing calls.

Also seen with: Fox Corp., Safe Security, Perfect Corp., CompuGroup Medical, Scribe, Resilinc, Cleanwater1, Netwrix Corp., Schneider, Marcus Evans, Datarobot Inc.

### ❌ WHAT'S NOT WORKING (Ranked by Frequency)

#### RANK \#1: User Adoption & Daily Workflow Concerns

Raised in 57 of 62 calls (92%)

User adoption concerns affect nine out of ten calls, making this the overwhelming dominant friction point. Customers consistently express skepticism about whether sellers would actually use Studio or whether it would become "shelfware." Concerns center on whether the tool would fit into existing daily workflows.

The objection manifests as operations/RevOps buyers who understand Studio's value but question whether sellers will adopt it. This is a "buyer-user mismatch" where the economic buyer sees clear ROI but doesn't believe end users will change behavior.

Key objection patterns: • "Will sellers actually use this?" \- repeated in nearly every call • RevOps persona understands value but questions whether sellers will adopt • Concerns about training burden and change management complexity • Fear of tool becoming shelfware despite clear capabilities • Need for seamless workflow integration vs. separate destination • Requires executive mandate for adoption vs. organic usage

Example from Verkada: Mallory questioned whether reps would actually log into Studio daily given they already work across Outreach, Tien, and direct email. She stated that adding another platform \- even one with clear value \- creates adoption risk if it's not seamlessly embedded in their current workflow. The "will sellers actually use this?" question dominated the objection discussion.

Pattern across 57 accounts: This objection appeared in 92% of calls across all customer segments, company sizes, and industries. The consistency indicates this is a fundamental positioning challenge rather than a product gap. The concern exists independently of feature completeness \- customers question adoption even when all their technical requirements are met.

#### RANK \#2: Missing Features & Product Gaps

Raised in 52 of 62 calls (84%) **Trend:** ↑ Increasing from 32% last period

Missing features affect 84% of calls, TRIPLING from last period (32% → 84%). Customers identify specific capabilities they expected or needed that Studio doesn't currently offer. These gaps range from missing integrations to workflow features to data types.

Critically, these aren't edge cases \- they're core requirements that customers articulate as blockers to full deployment. The dramatic increase suggests product-market fit challenges are growing as Studio matures and encounters more sophisticated buyer requirements.

Most common missing features (detailed breakdown in Section 5): • Conversation intelligence integration (Gong, Chorus, Clari) \- 36 accounts • Clay-style visual workflow builder with custom formulas \- 21 accounts • Native CRM integrations beyond Salesforce \- 11 accounts • Sales engagement platform integration (Outreach, Salesloft) \- 20 accounts • Intent data platform integration (6sense, Demandbase) \- 11 accounts

Example from Merkle: Merkle identified critical gaps including lack of native HubSpot integration (they're a HubSpot shop, not Salesforce), inability to customize AI prompts for their specific industry vertical, and missing support for their preferred data warehouse solution. These weren't edge cases but core requirements for their evaluation.

Pattern across 52 accounts: Missing integrations (HubSpot, specific CRMs, data warehouses), lack of industry-specific templates, insufficient technographic granularity, limited custom field support, missing API endpoints, incomplete reporting capabilities

#### RANK \#3: Integration Complexity & CRM Compatibility

Raised in 39 of 62 calls (63%) **Trend:** → Stable from 36% last period

Integration challenges surfaced in nearly two-thirds of calls. Customers express concern about connecting Studio to their existing tech stack or encounter limitations with their specific CRM platform. While stable percentage-wise from last period, the absolute number of accounts affected (39) indicates this remains a major deployment barrier.

Key objection patterns: • Salesforce custom object limitations and territory assignment complexity • HubSpot compatibility gaps for non-Salesforce customers • Data warehouse sync issues and API rate limits • Bidirectional sync concerns and field mapping challenges • Implementation timeline and technical resource requirements • "We've been burned before" by integration promises

Example from Frost Bank: Frost Bank's complex Salesforce setup with custom objects, territory rules, and proprietary underwriting data integration created significant concerns about implementation timeline and technical lift. While they saw clear value, the integration complexity became a major discussion point that consumed significant meeting time and energy.

Pattern across 39 accounts: Salesforce custom object limitations, territory assignment complexity, HubSpot compatibility gaps, data warehouse sync issues, API rate limits, bidirectional sync concerns, field mapping challenges

#### RANK \#4: Pricing Concerns & Budget Constraints

Raised in 25 of 62 calls (40%) **Trend:** ↑ Increasing from 29% last period

Pricing emerged as an objection or concern in 40% of calls, up from 29% last period. Customers express uncertainty about cost, question ROI, or indicate budget timing constraints. The increase suggests pricing/ROI justification is becoming more challenging.

Key objection patterns: • $30-50K price point creates sticker shock • Need to prove ROI before committing budget • Incremental cost on top of existing ZoomInfo spend • Budget already allocated elsewhere requiring reallocation • Year-end timing makes new purchases difficult • Need to sunset other tools to free up budget

Example from DigiCert: DigiCert raised pricing concerns early in the conversation, questioning whether the $30-50K investment could be justified given their current ZoomInfo spend and recent budget cuts. They needed clear ROI metrics and case studies showing quantifiable efficiency gains before they could move forward with evaluation.

Pattern across 25 accounts: $30-50K price point creates sticker shock, need to prove ROI before committing, budget already allocated elsewhere, year-end timing makes new purchases difficult, need to sunset other tools to free up budget

#### RANK \#5: Product Complexity & Learning Curve

Raised in 21 of 62 calls (34%) **Trend:** → Stable from 7% last period (note: different measurement)

Customers express concern that Studio feels complex, requires significant training, or has a steep learning curve for their teams to become proficient. However, at 34%, this affects a minority of customers compared to adoption concerns (92%).

Key objection patterns: • Concerns about training time required for proficiency • Complexity feels overwhelming for non-technical users • Need simplified workflows for sellers vs. power users • Worry about ongoing support burden during ramp period

Example from Frost Bank: Frost Bank expressed concerns about the learning curve required for their producers (70-75 people) to become proficient with Studio. With limited technical resources and producers focused on selling, they questioned whether the training investment would be justified and how long it would take before they saw productivity gains.

Pattern across 21 accounts: Concerns about training time required, complexity feels overwhelming, need simplified workflows for non-technical users, worry about support burden during ramp

#### RANK \#6: Data Quality & Accuracy Concerns

Raised in 10 of 62 calls (16%) **Trend:** ↑ Increasing from 4% last period

Customers question the quality, accuracy, or currency of ZoomInfo's data, particularly for specialized industries or international markets. The increase from 4% to 16% (4x growth) suggests growing data quality concerns that warrant attention.

Key objection patterns: • Past negative experiences with ZoomInfo data accuracy • Concerns about international market coverage • Skepticism about technographic reliability and currency • Need for data validation before trusting automated workflows

Example from Coretelligent: Multiple Coretelligent calls raised concerns about ZoomInfo data accuracy based on past experiences with outdated contact information. They expressed skepticism about investing in Studio if the underlying data quality issues haven't been resolved, stating "the platform is only as good as the data behind it."

Pattern across 10 accounts: Past negative experiences with ZoomInfo data accuracy, concerns about international coverage, skepticism about technographic reliability, need for data validation before trusting automated workflows

### 🔸 NEW FRICTION PATTERNS THIS PERIOD

No genuinely new friction patterns emerged. All objections aligned with existing baseline categories, though the relative frequencies shifted significantly (adoption concerns and missing features both increased dramatically).

## SECTION 2: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Clay Competitive Mentions

**Mentioned in:** 16 of 62 calls (26%) **Trend:** ↓ Decreasing from 51% last period but remains significant

Clay continues as the primary competitive comparison point, though frequency decreased from the peak 51% in Nov 28-Dec 12\. Customers position Clay as the benchmark for flexibility and affordability, though at lower frequency suggests competitive positioning may be improving.

Key competitive themes: • Clay seen as more flexible for custom workflows • Pricing pressure: Clay positioned as 1/3 the cost • Easier learning curve and faster deployment • Better at connecting diverse data sources without vendor lock-in

Pattern: Clay is positioned as the "flexibility and affordability" alternative. Customers who mention Clay typically frame it as: "We're evaluating Clay as well" or "How is this different from Clay?" rather than "We're already using Clay." This suggests Clay is in evaluation set but not necessarily incumbent.

Accounts mentioning Clay: Keeper, Orolabs.ai, Safe Security, Perfect Corp., Cyera, Sunstate Equipment, CoreTrust, Resilinc, Schneider, Quest Resource, Merkle, Criteria Corp., Datarobot Inc., Nextiva, Ankura Consulting, Verkada

## SECTION 4: OBJECTION HANDLING

### 🔹 BASELINE OBJECTION PATTERNS

See "What's Not Working" section above for detailed objection analysis. Top objections by frequency:

1. User Adoption & Daily Workflow Concerns (92%)  
2. Missing Features & Product Gaps (84%)  
3. Integration Complexity & CRM Compatibility (63%)  
4. Pricing Concerns & Budget Constraints (40%)  
5. Product Complexity & Learning Curve (34%)  
6. Data Quality & Accuracy Concerns (16%)

SECTION 5: PRODUCT FEEDBACK (Ranked by Frequency)

### 🔹 BASELINE FEATURE REQUESTS

#### Theme \#1: Conversation Intelligence Platform Integration (Gong, Chorus, Clari)

**Status:** 🚨 CRITICAL \- Top Request by Wide Margin **Requested by:** 36 of 62 accounts (58%) **Trend:** ↑ Increasing from 50% last period

What customers want: Native connectors to pull call transcript data from Gong, Chorus, and Clari for semantic analysis at scale. Customers want to identify competitive mentions, common objections, successful messaging patterns, and buying signals across their entire call database without manual review.

Specific requests: • Gong integration for semantic analysis of call transcripts \- Vanguard Renewables, Orolabs.ai, Fox Corp., Safe Security, Perfect Corp., and 14 more • Chorus integration for competitive intelligence extraction \- Ibisworld, CompuGroup Medical, Case Status, Scribe, and 8 more • Clari integration for pipeline signals \- Sunstate Equipment, QIMA, CoreTrust • AI-powered pattern detection across calls (what messages work, what objections surface) \- Redo, Resilinc, Cleanwater1, and 9 more

**Rationale:** This is THE top request at 58%, appearing in both questions (58%) and feature requests (58%). Customers see call intelligence as the "missing piece" that would differentiate Studio from Clay and other competitors. The sustained high demand (50% → 58%) indicates this is table stakes for sophisticated GTM operations. Should be absolute highest product priority.

---

#### Theme \#2: Clay-Style Workflow Builder & Custom Formulas

**Status:** ↑ High Priority \- Direct Competitive Response **Requested by:** 21 of 62 accounts (34%) **Trend:** ↑ Increasing from 31 accounts (33%) last period

What customers want: Visual workflow builder similar to Clay's interface where users can chain together data enrichment, transformation, and action steps using custom formulas and logic. Customers want the ability to build complex, multi-step workflows without requiring CSV exports and re-imports.

Specific requests: • Visual workflow canvas where users can drag-and-drop data transformation steps \- Keeper, Orolabs.ai, Safe Security, and 8 more • Custom formula language (similar to Excel or Clay) for data manipulation \- Cyera, Sunstate Equipment, CoreTrust, and 6 more • Conditional logic and branching (if/then workflows) \- Resilinc, Cleanwater1, Schneider, and 5 more • Ability to chain multiple enrichment providers (not just ZoomInfo) \- Quest Resource, Merkle, Datarobot Inc., Nextiva

**Rationale:** This is the most frequent new request (34% of calls) and directly responds to Clay competitive threat. Customers explicitly state "Clay lets me do this" when asking for these capabilities. The visual workflow builder represents fundamental UX paradigm that Studio currently lacks. Without this, Studio feels like "just a better UI for ZoomInfo data" rather than a true orchestration platform.

---

#### Theme \#3: Sales Engagement Platform Integration (Outreach, Salesloft)

**Status:** → High Priority **Requested by:** 20 of 62 accounts (32%) **Trend:** → Stable from 15 accounts last period

What customers want: Direct, bi-directional integration with Outreach and Salesloft that allows audiences to flow seamlessly from Studio into cadences without manual CSV export/import, and activity data to flow back for reporting.

Specific requests: • Push audiences directly into Outreach cadences with field mapping \- Vanguard Renewables, Keeper, TextUs, and 7 more • Pull Outreach/Salesloft activity data back into Studio for engagement tracking \- Perfect Corp., CoreTrust, and 5 more • Maintain talk tracks and personalization from Studio into sequence templates \- Schneider, Merkle, Criteria Corp.

**Rationale:** Strong demand (32% of calls) indicates ongoing workflow completion need. Important for seller activation but customers are more willing to accept manual export/import workaround here versus conversation intelligence gaps. Medium-high priority relative to Gong/Chorus integration.

---

#### Theme \#4: Native CRM Integrations Beyond Salesforce/HubSpot

**Status:** → High Priority **Requested by:** 11 of 62 accounts (18%) **Trend:** ↓ Decreasing from 23 accounts (24%) last period

What customers want: Customers need Studio to natively integrate with enterprise CRM systems beyond Salesforce and HubSpot, particularly Microsoft Dynamics, custom-built CRMs, and industry-specific solutions.

Specific requests: • Microsoft Dynamics native integration with bi-directional sync \- Copado Solutions, ADP \- Sales, CompuGroup Medical, and 4 more • Custom CRM API support with flexible field mapping \- Netwrix Corp., Silverfort, Omilia • Improved Salesforce custom object support beyond standard objects \- Frost Bank, Citizens Financial, Coretelligent

**Rationale:** Request volume decreased but 18% still indicates meaningful TAM constraint. Non-Salesforce shops are effectively blocked from evaluation, and even Salesforce customers with complex configurations face limitations. Microsoft Dynamics alone is 45%+ CRM market share that Studio can't effectively address.

---

#### Theme \#5: Intent Data Platform Integration (6sense, Demandbase)

**Status:** → Medium Priority **Requested by:** 11 of 62 accounts (18%) **Trend:** → Stable from 36 accounts (38%) last period (note: methodology difference)

What customers want: Native connectors to pull intent signals from 6sense and Demandbase for organizations already invested in these platforms, rather than requiring migration to ZoomInfo's intent data.

Specific requests: • 6sense intent topics and keyword tracking integration \- Orolabs.ai, Safe Security, and 4 more • Demandbase account engagement scores \- Netwrix Corp., Schneider, Merkle • Preserve existing intent scoring models without re-training \- Safe Security, Merkle

**Rationale:** Consistent demand (18% of accounts) but represents existing platform investment that creates switching cost resistance. Important for enterprise deals where intent platform contracts already exist, but not blocking deals as severely as CRM or conversation intelligence gaps.

---

#### Theme \#6: Territory & Account Assignment Automation

**Status:** → Medium Priority  
**Requested by:** 5 of 62 accounts (8%) **Trend:** ↓ Decreasing from 18 accounts (19%) last period

What customers want: Automated territory assignment and account routing based on complex rules (geography, company size, industry, existing relationships) that dynamically updates as account characteristics change.

Specific requests: • Rule-based territory assignment with multiple criteria \- Frost Bank, Citizens Financial • Automatic reassignment when accounts grow or change ICP fit \- Coretelligent • Conflict resolution when multiple reps claim same account \- Verkada, Infor

**Rationale:** Decreased significantly (19% → 8%), suggesting either: (1) customers have accepted manual territory management, (2) this need is captured in other objections, or (3) only affects niche segment. Worth monitoring but not urgent priority given declining mentions.

---

#### Theme \#7: Advanced Reporting & Analytics Dashboards

**Status:** → Low Priority **Requested by:** 3 of 62 accounts (5%) **Trend:** ↓ Decreasing from 22 accounts (23%) last period

What customers want: Pre-built and customizable dashboards showing Studio usage, enrichment consumption, workflow performance, and ROI metrics.

Specific requests: • Usage dashboards showing which users/teams actively use Studio \- Schneider, Ankura Consulting • Credit consumption analytics to identify waste and optimize spend \- Merkle

**Rationale:** Dramatic decrease (23% → 5%) suggests this is either: (1) being handled through other means, (2) not as critical as initially thought, or (3) only relevant post-adoption. Low priority given declining demand.
