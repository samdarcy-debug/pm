Assessing whether the dataset fits their specific needs
Exploring samples before committing
Interested but facing budget/timing constraints
Comparing against existing solutions

Sample Neutral Feedback:

ARCO Construction (Licensed Contractors): Acknowledged it "would depend on the project" and noted it "could be helpful for projects in states with contractor licensing requirements," but didn't express enthusiasm or commitment.

Heartland Logistics (Commercial Fleet): Touched on the dataset but conversation remained exploratory without commitment signals.

What This Means: Many neutral conversations represent pipeline opportunities - customers who need more time, information, or internal alignment before moving forward. These aren't "no" responses; they're "tell me more" or "not yet" responses.


WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
Negative Feedback (15 conversations)
Breakdown of Concerns:

Existing Solutions/Alternatives (5 accounts, 33%)
Data Quality/Accuracy (4 accounts, 27%)
Price/Budget (2 accounts, 13%)
Value/ROI Unclear (1 account, 7%)
Multiple Concerns (3 accounts, 20%)
1. Existing Solutions/Alternatives (5 accounts)
Some customers already have this data or found alternatives:

Richey May Co. (Form 5500): Pricing "$45,000 for Colorado or $100,000 for all states is a little higher than I thought it was going to be" when "their existing data provider costs less than $10,000 annually."

Spring Health (Form 5500): "Can't build a value prop for the dataset and sees no path to demonstrate 3x return on the 6 figure contract cost."

Mastery Logistics (Commercial Fleet): "Data points shown (gross vehicle weight, fleet size in pounds) are not useful for logistics marketing" - wrong attributes for their needs.

Houzz (Licensed Contractors): "Sample dataset lacked critical contact information (emails and phone numbers), which is a fundamental requirement for any lead they would want to generate."

Menemsha Development (Franchise/Restaurant): "Stays away from franchise work 99.9% of the time" - not relevant to their business model.
2. Data Quality/Accuracy (4 accounts)
A small number of customers identified specific data quality issues:

Lytx (Commercial Fleet): "Fleet size data only matched their existing CRM data 26% of the time... I don't feel comfortable right now."

LiveView Technologies (General): "Capturing information for construction, fast food/franchisees, and industrials is really really hard to capture via ZoomInfo."

Mountain West Insurance (First Mover Advantage): "Needs to overcome objections with partners and is worried about pitching something without a compelling ROI story" - concerns about data quality proof points.

3. Price/Budget (2 accounts)
Pricing surprised some customers:

BrightSpeed (Franchise): "$250,000 annual pricing... stated 'there's no chance' they could justify this cost... expected pricing around $50,000-$75,000."

Ericsson (Restaurant/Franchise): "Six-figure pricing ($350K-$629K total) not aligning with their budget... 'I don't think a 6 figure investment would make sense.'"
4. Value/ROI Unclear (1 account)
The Jacobson Group (Insurance Producers): "Insurance agent roles represent 'low margin rules' where 'doing that would be suicide from a P&L standpoint.'"
5. Other Fit Issues (1 account)
CRF Solutions (Licensed Contractors): "Dataset focuses on individual contractor licenses rather than company-level administrative contacts, which is what CRF Solutions actually requires."
6. Multiple Concerns (3 accounts)
Some accounts expressed combinations of price, data quality, and value concerns.

CONCLUSION
Vertical datasets generate strong positive engagement (38% of conversations) when they solve specific customer pain points with data that's difficult to find elsewhere. The specific use cases customers articulate - from enriching existing accounts to avoiding duplicate outreach - demonstrate clear product-market fit for targeted industries.

The 56% neutral conversations represent significant pipeline opportunity. These customers are actively exploring and evaluating, discussing use cases and assessing value. They need more information, samples, time, or internal alignment before moving forward - but they're engaged in the conversation.

The 6% negative sentiment (15 conversations) highlights specific areas for improvement:

Competitive positioning: Some customers have existing solutions at lower price points
Data quality assurance: A few high-profile accuracy concerns (Lytx 26% match rate, LiveView data gaps)
Pricing expectations: Some surprise at 6-figure pricing levels
Value demonstration: Need clearer ROI stories for some use cases

Dataset Performance Highlights:

Strong performers: Commercial Fleet, MSP/MSSP, Restaurant, Franchise
Need attention: First Mover Advantage (validation concerns), Form 5500 (pricing sensitivity)
Pain point addressed: "Hard to find data" is a recurring positive theme

Overall customer feedback suggests vertical datasets fill real market gaps. The strongest resonance comes from customers who:

Face a specific challenge the dataset addresses
Can immediately articulate how they'll use the data
Find the data differentiated from existing sources
See efficiency gains or revenue opportunities

The majority of conversations (94%) are either positive or exploratory, indicating strong market interest with opportunity to convert neutral customers through better value demonstration, competitive pricing strategies, and continued data quality assurance.
