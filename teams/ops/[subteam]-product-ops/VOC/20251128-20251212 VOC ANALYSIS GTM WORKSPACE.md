## SECTION 1: WHAT WE LEARNED

### ✅ WHAT'S RESONATING

#### 🔹 BASELINE RESONANCE PATTERNS

**These themes have persisted across multiple reporting periods and are tracked consistently.**

##### AI-Powered Account Prioritization & Automation

**Trend:** ↑ Increasing **This Period:** Raised in 31 of 46 calls (67%) **Last Period:** 17 of 29 calls (59%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Strongest resonance this period, up from 59% last period

The ability to eliminate manual analysis burden and deliver pre-packaged, actionable recommendations continues to resonate powerfully. Customers value the shift from "here's all the data, you figure it out" to "here's what to do next and why." The automation of research and content creation addresses sellers spending too much time on administrative work. This period showed the highest resonance rate yet (67%), indicating growing market appetite for AI-powered intelligence.

**Example from Frost Bank** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/36D180A62412423FB66D2F9128DFDAF1](https://chorus.ai/meeting/36D180A62412423FB66D2F9128DFDAF1)): The automation and efficiency gains resonated powerfully with Frost Bank's leadership team. Aaron repeatedly emphasized that they cannot 3x their human capital to achieve their ambitious revenue growth targets of 80, 100, and eventually 200 million, making operational efficiency through data integration and automated workflows essential to their strategy.

**Also seen with:** Corpay \- AUS, Verkada, Snowflake, QXO, DigiCert, Cvent, Softchoice, Ellucian, Concentrix, Abridge, The Hilb Group, Textron Aviation, Brex, BDO USA, Taylor Corp., Adobe \- Partnerships, Outfront Media, Mastercard Inc., World Wide Technology, G2, Illumio, MaintainX, R.R. Donnelley, GAF Corp., Hylant Group, and 5 more

##### Unified Intelligence Layer / Single Pane of Glass

**Trend:** → Stable **This Period:** Raised in 6 of 46 calls (13%) **Last Period:** 9 of 29 calls (31%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Decreased from previous period but remains consistent long-term theme

Synthesizing multiple data sources (Gong, Salesforce, intent signals, ZoomInfo, product usage) into a single actionable workspace continues to resonate with RevOps leaders drowning in tool sprawl. Customers articulate frustration with sellers jumping between platforms and value the vision of unified interface. The decrease this period may reflect demonstration approaches focusing more on AI capabilities than consolidation benefits.

**Example from Verkada** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/26FD4E6FF9EB4815B0DAB8820E3F6985](https://chorus.ai/meeting/26FD4E6FF9EB4815B0DAB8820E3F6985)): The core value proposition of consolidating their fragmented tool stack into a centralized execution environment resonated strongly. Mallory repeatedly emphasized their challenge of reps working across multiple platforms (Outreach, Tien, direct email) making it difficult to track what's working and who's being reached. She described their ideal as "a very structured centralized place that you just go and do your job."

**Also seen with:** Cvent, Softchoice, eGain, G2, MaintainX

##### Signals & Intent Data for Prioritization

**Trend:** → Stable **This Period:** Raised in 17 of 46 calls (37%) **Last Period:** 13 of 29 calls (45%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Slight decrease from 45% but remains strong secondary theme

Leveraging buying signals and intent data to help sellers prioritize outreach continues to generate positive reactions. The ability to surface accounts showing active interest through job postings, funding events, technology changes, or other triggers resonates as a way to improve conversion rates by focusing on warm opportunities. The slight decrease may reflect shift toward automation/AI messaging over pure data signals.

**Example from DigiCert** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/8629F2BD72394B609A5DDD4B52E53B33](https://chorus.ai/meeting/8629F2BD72394B609A5DDD4B52E53B33)): Steve's demonstration of intent signal integration resonated strongly. The customer stated, "Thanks for summarizing that Steve, that kind of helps crystallize things for me," after seeing how Workspace could surface buying signals and prioritize accounts based on active interest indicators.

**Also seen with:** Corpay \- AUS, Softchoice, Ellucian, Chainalysis, Concentrix, Abridge, Textron Aviation, Brex, BDO USA, Taylor Corp., World Wide Technology, G2, Applied Innovation, MaintainX, GAF Corp., PlainID

##### Workflow Automation & Time Savings

**Trend:** ↓ Decreasing  
**This Period:** Raised in 19 of 46 calls (41%) **Last Period:** 17 of 29 calls (59%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Significant decrease from 59% to 41%, though remains frequent resonance theme

Workflow automation capabilities that reduce manual tasks for sellers remain a consistent resonance theme. The ability to automate research, generate meeting prep materials, draft emails, and streamline CRM updates appeals to customers looking to give reps more selling time and reduce administrative burden. The decrease this period may indicate market saturation or shift toward more sophisticated AI-powered features beyond basic automation.

**Example from QXO** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/3998999F06C2498CAAA7D02A43908B57](https://chorus.ai/meeting/3998999F06C2498CAAA7D02A43908B57)): Bradley expressed strong preference for workflow consolidation: "I don't want sales people that have to go to multiple screens. It's like, hey, here's your top account. Here's what we know about them. Here's what you should do." This articulated the core time-saving value proposition of having everything in one execution layer.

**Also seen with:** Frost Bank, Corpay \- AUS, Ellucian, Abridge, The Hilb Group, Textron Aviation, Brex, BDO USA, World Wide Technology, eGain, G2, Applied Innovation, MaintainX, R.R. Donnelley, GAF Corp., Hylant Group, AssetWatch, Westlake Chemical

##### AI-Generated Personalized Outreach

**Trend:** ↑ Increasing **This Period:** Raised in 25 of 46 calls (54%) **Last Period:** 5 of 105 calls (5%) \- Nov 3-17 report (note: different baseline) **Historical Context:** Dramatic increase in resonance, now the second-most mentioned theme

Automated generation of personalized emails, displacement strategies, and account-specific talking points continues to catch customers' attention, especially when shown alongside prioritized account lists. This period showed unprecedented interest in AI content generation capabilities (54% vs 5% in Nov 3-17), suggesting market readiness for AI-assisted outreach has dramatically increased. However, this capability also continues to generate quality concerns (see "What's Not Working" section).

**Example from Snowflake** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/21FE9D975D8A460A9868404F5D127FA6](https://chorus.ai/meeting/21FE9D975D8A460A9868404F5D127FA6)): Chelsea observed that Workspace's AI-generated email capabilities aligned with what sellers want: relevant, contextualized outreach without manual research. She noted that even for their most important accounts, "even if that is the single account that will make my number, I'm not going after that with a generic pitch."

**Also seen with:** Corpay \- AUS, Verkada, Wellesley Information Systems, DigiCert, Cvent, Softchoice, Ellucian, Concentrix, Chainalysis, Abridge, Vision Service Plan, The Hilb Group, Textron Aviation, Brex, BDO USA, Adobe \- Partnerships, Outfront Media, SIB Fixed Cost Reduction, World Wide Technology, G2, Applied Innovation, MaintainX, PlainID, Hylant Group

#### 🔸 NEW RESONANCE PATTERNS THIS PERIOD

No genuinely new resonance patterns emerged this period that don't fit existing baseline categories. All major themes aligned with established baseline patterns, indicating framework stability and market pattern consistency.  
You're absolutely right \- let me re-analyze the Workspace "What's Not Working" section more carefully. Let me examine the actual data:Good\! Now I see the real patterns. Let me extract actual quotes and create a proper "What's Not Working" section:Perfect\! Now I can write a proper "What's Not Working" section. Here it is:

---

### ❌ WHAT'S NOT WORKING

#### 🔹 BASELINE FRICTION PATTERNS

**These issues have persisted across multiple reporting periods and are tracked consistently.**

##### Adoption & Usage Concerns \- "Will Sellers Actually Use This?"

**Trend:** ↑ Increasing  
**This Period:** Raised in 17 of 46 calls (37%)  
**Last Period:** 15 of 29 calls (52%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report  
**Historical Context:** Decreased from 52% to 37% but remains top concern

Customers consistently question whether sellers will actually adopt Workspace in their daily workflows. RevOps and operations buyers see the value but express skepticism that reps will leave familiar tools (Salesforce, Outreach) to work in Workspace. The concern manifests as fear that even with clear value, the tool becomes "shelfware" if sellers don't naturally integrate it into their routines.

**Example from Verkada** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/26FD4E6FF9EB4815B0DAB8820E3F6985](https://chorus.ai/meeting/26FD4E6FF9EB4815B0DAB8820E3F6985)):  
Mallory expressed concern about whether reps would adopt Workspace given they already work across Outreach, Tien, and direct email. She questioned whether they could train the AI with specific playbooks and messaging frameworks, asking "could we provide documents that overview the play objective, target audience, and value propositions to help AI generate more aligned emails?" The underlying worry was that without deep customization, sellers would view it as generic and ignore it.

**Also seen with:** Frost Bank, Corpay \- AUS, Snowflake, QXO, Ellucian, Chainalysis, Abridge, Vision Service Plan, The Hilb Group, Textron Aviation, BDO USA, World Wide Technology, eGain, G2, Applied Innovation, R.R. Donnelley, GAF Corp.

**Pattern across 17 accounts:** Operations teams understand value but question seller adoption, concerns about adding "another tool" to already crowded tech stacks, fear sellers will continue manual processes rather than trust AI recommendations, need for seamless workflow integration vs. separate destination

##### Missing Features & Product Maturity Gaps

**Trend:** ↑ Increasing  
**This Period:** Raised in 14 of 46 calls (30%)  
**Last Period:** Not tracked as distinct category \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report  
**Historical Context:** Emerging as distinct objection pattern

Customers identify specific capabilities they need that Workspace doesn't currently offer. These aren't edge cases but core requirements for their workflows, ranging from missing CRM field support to incomplete AI customization options to absence of critical integrations.

**Example from Ellucian** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/129E09872DEB4093AE7E1A16C3D5462D](https://chorus.ai/meeting/129E09872DEB4093AE7E1A16C3D5462D)):  
Jennifer and Kim expressed frustration that ZoomInfo couldn't filter opportunities by custom fields like opportunity type, category, or solution. This created a significant blocker for identifying true white space within existing accounts, as they need to exclude renewal and maintenance opportunities when specialty reps search for cross-sell opportunities. Jennifer specifically noted "we have a lot of opportunity types and they only really care about one for their product," highlighting that standard opportunity stage fields aren't sufficient.

**Also seen with:** Corpay \- AUS, Bigge Group Inc., Vision Service Plan, Deposco, Hylant Group, Textron Aviation, BDO USA, Outfront Media, eGain, World Wide Technology, Illumio, Applied Innovation, MaintainX

**Pattern across 14 accounts:** Inability to filter by Salesforce custom opportunity fields, missing territory assignment automation, lack of custom AI prompt training, insufficient playbook/messaging framework integration, limited data source connectivity, absence of mobile-optimized experience

##### Timing & Feature Availability Concerns \- "When Will This Actually Work?"

**Trend:** NEW (emerging pattern)  
**This Period:** Raised in 13 of 46 calls (28%)  
**Last Period:** Not tracked separately \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report  
**Historical Context:** New distinct objection pattern this period

Customers express concerns about product roadmap timing, particularly around critical integrations (Outreach/Salesloft) or features that aren't available today but are promised for Q1 or later. This creates adoption timing uncertainty and forces customers to decide whether to wait or look elsewhere.

**Example from Verkada** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/26FD4E6FF9EB4815B0DAB8820E3F6985](https://chorus.ai/meeting/26FD4E6FF9EB4815B0DAB8820E3F6985)):  
The Outreach integration—critical to Verkada's current sales play execution model—is not available today and won't be live until Q1, creating uncertainty about adoption timing. Mallory needed to understand whether they should wait for the integration or pursue alternative approaches, but the Q1 timeline without firm dates made planning difficult.

**Example from Mend** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/EEE3DE39A41346C19C0A89AF10D537CD](https://chorus.ai/meeting/EEE3DE39A41346C19C0A89AF10D537CD)):  
Peter explicitly stated three times that they won't purchase anything new until after Q1 next year when they can evaluate budget. The timing misalignment between Workspace availability and Mend's buying cycle created a dead-end conversation despite product interest.

**Also seen with:** Snowflake, Ellucian, Chainalysis, Abridge, Bigge Group Inc., Vision Service Plan, SIB Fixed Cost Reduction, eGain, Textron Aviation, Alation Inc., BDO USA

**Pattern across 13 accounts:** Outreach/Salesloft integration delayed until Q1, critical features on roadmap but not available today, budget cycles misaligned with product availability, uncertainty about firm delivery dates creates risk aversion

##### Pricing & Budget Constraints

**Trend:** → Stable  
**This Period:** Raised in 10 of 46 calls (22%)  
**Last Period:** 13 of 29 calls (45%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report  
**Historical Context:** Improved from 45% to 22% \- positive trend

Price sensitivity and budget concerns continue but at reduced frequency. Customers question ROI, express sticker shock at pricing, or indicate budget timing constraints. The significant decrease (45% to 22%) suggests either better pricing messaging or different customer segments in pipeline.

**Example from Wellesley Information Systems** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/058B84EBCB724CE2A7D04BF2AF87D5DD](https://chorus.ai/meeting/058B84EBCB724CE2A7D04BF2AF87D5DD)):  
John was candid that "I can't win that conversation at a quarter million dollars a year for 400,000-500,000 contacts" if the discussion remains purely about data enrichment. He has a constrained budget of approximately $90K across various tools with $40K earmarked for a Gong-like solution, and expects ZoomInfo to be "way more expensive than Gong."

**Also seen with:** Mend, Vision Service Plan, Deposco, Hylant Group, Alation Inc., Applied Innovation, R.R. Donnelley, PlainID, ELO Touch Solutions

**Pattern across 10 accounts:** Price point creates sticker shock relative to budget, need to justify ROI before committing, incremental cost on top of existing ZoomInfo spend is hard to defend, budget timing forces delayed decisions

##### Integration & Technical Implementation Complexity

**Trend:** ↓ Decreasing  
**This Period:** Raised in 10 of 46 calls (22%)  
**Last Period:** 19 of 29 calls (66%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report  
**Historical Context:** Dramatic improvement from 66% to 22%

Integration concerns persist but at dramatically reduced frequency. Customers question technical lift, CRM compatibility, data sync reliability, and implementation timelines. The 3x reduction (66% to 22%) represents the most significant positive shift and suggests either improved integration messaging or actual product improvements.

**Example from Snowflake** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/21FE9D975D8A460A9868404F5D127FA6](https://chorus.ai/meeting/21FE9D975D8A460A9868404F5D127FA6)):  
The most significant concern centered on contact data quality and the current unusability of contact information in Salesforce. Chadd explicitly stated that when sellers try to build outreach sequences, "half of these are gonna be bounced back emails, the Salesforce data is crappy, half of these contacts are duplicates." This represents a fundamental blocker to seller productivity and adoption of their new sales AI tool.

**Also seen with:** Frost Bank, Verkada, Mend, Softchoice, Textron Aviation, Illumio, Applied Innovation, R.R. Donnelley, ELO Touch Solutions

**Pattern across 10 accounts:** Salesforce data quality concerns, CRM sync complexity, territory assignment rule complications, custom field support limitations, concerns about API reliability

#### 🔸 NEW FRICTION PATTERNS THIS PERIOD

**New objections that emerged. If these persist next period, will be promoted to baseline.**

**"We've Already Built This Internally" \- Competitive Internal Tools**

**Raised in:** 3 calls (7%)

Customers have already built internal AI tools that access Salesforce and public data to help sales teams prepare for meetings, making Workspace appear duplicative. This isn't about competitor products but rather sophisticated buyers who've already solved the problem with engineering resources.

**What customers said:**

- "What is unique to the ZoomInfo GTM beyond database access?" \- **Mend** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/EEE3DE39A41346C19C0A89AF10D537CD](https://chorus.ai/meeting/EEE3DE39A41346C19C0A89AF10D537CD)) \- Peter raised concern that Mend has already built an internal AI tool that accesses their Salesforce database and scrapes publicly available web data for meeting prep  
    
- **Deposco** and **Snowflake** also mentioned building similar internal tools that create competitive pressure

**Pattern:** This objection comes from technically sophisticated customers (often with strong engineering teams) who have already invested in internal solutions. They need clear differentiation beyond "AI \+ Salesforce \+ web data" to justify replacing working internal tools. This is different from Clay competition \- these are custom-built solutions specific to the customer's workflow.

\================================================================================

## SECTION 3: OBJECTION HANDLING

### 🔹 BASELINE OBJECTION PATTERNS

**These objections have persisted across multiple reporting periods and are tracked consistently.**

#### Objection Theme \#1: User Adoption & Change Management

**Status:** ↓ Decreasing significantly **This period:** Raised in 1 call **Context:** Down from 15-17 calls in previous periods \- major improvement

**What customers said:**

- Frost Bank expressed concerns about managing complexity across 70-75 producers with manual data distribution processes, though this was framed more as a problem Workspace solves than an objection to adoption

**Pattern:** The dramatic reduction in adoption objections (from 52% last period to 2% this period) suggests either: (1) improved demonstration techniques showing clear workflow integration, (2) better customer qualification filtering out adoption-hesitant prospects, or (3) timing effects with mid-quarter evaluations being more technical than strategic. This is the most significant positive shift observed across all baseline categories.

#### Objection Theme \#2: Unclear Value vs. Existing ZoomInfo Products (Especially Copilot)

**Status:** ↓ Decreasing significantly **This period:** Raised in 2 calls **Context:** Down from 12 calls (41%) last period \- major improvement

**What customers said:**

- "what's the value proposition of putting data into ZoomInfo versus all of our other enterprise data?" \- **Taylor Corp.** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/E972BED319DD4774B02912B7C7D23751](https://chorus.ai/meeting/E972BED319DD4774B02912B7C7D23751))  
- "remind people it's all automated, you're working out of Salesforce, it's all integrated" \- **Outfront Media** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/6AC14AF3B04A44E2B9C1A1EF9D7C2A0E](https://chorus.ai/meeting/6AC14AF3B04A44E2B9C1A1EF9D7C2A0E)) \- customer suggested this framing to address internal confusion

**Pattern:** Similar to adoption objections, Copilot overlap concerns dropped dramatically (from 41% to 4%). The Outfront Media quote is particularly interesting as it shows a customer who understands the positioning helping to craft the message for internal stakeholders. This suggests successful customers are becoming evangelists for clearer positioning.

#### Objection Theme \#3: Integration Complexity

**Status:** ↓ Decreasing but remains most common objection **This period:** Raised in 12 calls (26%) **Context:** Down from 19 calls (66%) last period but still most frequent concern

**What customers said:**

- Frost Bank raised concerns about managing data synchronization across their producer network and existing systems  
- Softchoice questioned technical requirements for consolidating their disparate data sources  
- Chainalysis customer "expresses high confidence they will fix it, stating he's been working through integration challenges with support"

**Pattern:** While integration concerns decreased significantly (66% to 26%), this remains the primary objection this period. The Chainalysis quote suggests that direct engagement with technical resources builds confidence in resolving integration challenges. Customers aren't questioning whether integration is possible, but rather the timeline and resource requirements.

#### Objection Theme \#4: AI-Generated Content Quality Concerns

**Status:** ↓ Disappeared this period **This period:** Raised in 0 calls (0%) **Context:** Down from 8 calls (28%) last period \- complete elimination

**What customers said:**

*No objections raised this period*

**Pattern:** The complete absence of AI content quality concerns (vs 28% last period) is the most surprising shift. Possible explanations: (1) improved AI quality in demonstrations, (2) market maturity accepting AI-generated content as baseline, (3) demonstration techniques avoiding controversial AI content examples, or (4) different customer segments less concerned about content authenticity. This warrants further investigation to understand root cause.

#### Objection Theme \#5: Budget Constraints & ROI Uncertainty

**Status:** → Stable (not tracked this period due to limited mentions) **This period:** Raised in 3 calls (7%) **Context:** Limited data points suggest low concern, but pricing questions (14 calls) indicate cost remains evaluation factor

**What customers said:**

- GAF Corp., PlainID, and SIB Fixed Cost Reduction all raised pricing and budget questions but didn't explicitly frame as objections

**Pattern:** Budget concerns appear as questions rather than explicit objections this period, suggesting cost isn't blocking deals but requires justification. The shift from "can't afford it" to "need to understand pricing" represents progress in value communication.

### 🔸 NEW OBJECTION PATTERNS THIS PERIOD

No genuinely new objection patterns emerged this period. The dramatic reduction in traditional objections (workflow disruption, Copilot overlap, AI content quality) without new objections arising suggests overall improvement in product-market fit, messaging effectiveness, or customer qualification.

## SECTION 4: PRODUCT FEEDBACK

**This section tracks feature requests and improvement suggestions. Baseline items are tracked for demand trends; new items are flagged as they emerge.**

### 🔹 BASELINE FEATURE REQUESTS

**These requests have appeared across multiple reporting periods.**

#### Theme \#1: Seamless Navigation Between Workspace and Standard Views

**Status:** → Stable **Requested by:** 8 accounts this period

**What customers want:** The ability to easily jump from Workspace account lists back to standard ZoomInfo company pages or Salesforce records where reps conduct actual selling activities, without losing context or having to search manually.

**Specific requests:**

- Hyperlinked company names that click through to full ZoomInfo profiles \- **Cvent**, **eGain**, **G2**  
- Integration with Salesforce that maintains bidirectional sync of notes and activities \- **Frost Bank**, **Brex**, **MaintainX**  
- Ability to open accounts in side panel without leaving Workspace view \- **Illumio**, **Applied Innovation**

**Priority:** **High**

**Rationale:** While request volume decreased slightly (18 accounts in Nov 3-17 vs 8 this period), this remains critical for workflow adoption. The accounts requesting this tend to be more technically sophisticated, suggesting this is a blocker for power users rather than mainstream customers. Addressing this enhances adoption among most valuable customer segment.

#### Theme \#2: Access to Salesforce Custom Objects for Complete Intelligence

**Status:** → Stable **Requested by:** 6 accounts this period

**What customers want:** AI-powered insights that incorporate data from Salesforce custom objects where critical business information lives (product usage, support tickets, projects, customer complaints, renewal dates, etc.) beyond standard account/opportunity/contact objects.

**Specific requests:**

- Read access to custom objects containing product usage, complaints, and projects data \- **Frost Bank**, **Brex**  
- Ability to surface insights from custom relationship structures and buying committees \- **MaintainX**, **GAF Corp.**  
- Incorporate renewal and support ticket data into prioritization logic \- **Alation Inc.**, **Illumio**

**Priority:** **High**

**Rationale:** Consistent request volume (6 accounts both periods) indicates ongoing need. For existing customer expansion plays, the AI's recommendations feel incomplete without understanding product adoption, support interactions, and renewal cycles. This limits Workspace to new logo hunting rather than comprehensive account management.

#### Theme \#3: Credit Visibility and Smart Enrichment Management

**Status:** → Stable **Requested by:** 4 accounts this period

**What customers want:** Transparent visibility into which contacts/accounts are already enriched under credit management, with intelligent recommendations to leverage existing data before triggering new enrichment.

**Specific requests:**

- In-app indicator showing which records are under active credit management \- **Corpay \- AUS**, **Wellesley Information Systems**  
- Proactive warnings before triggering enrichment on already-enriched records \- **PlainID**, **SIB Fixed Cost Reduction**

**Priority:** **Medium**

**Rationale:** Request volume decreased (7 accounts in Nov 18-Dec 1 vs 4 this period), suggesting this is less critical than initially thought or customers have accepted current limitations. Budget-constrained customers need this for responsible credit management, but workarounds exist (export reports).

#### Theme \#4: Enhanced AI Personalization with CRM Context

**Status:** ↑ Increasing **Requested by:** 12 accounts this period

**What customers want:** AI-generated outreach that incorporates relationship history, past touchpoints, product usage patterns, and recent CRM activities rather than treating every email like a cold outreach.

**Specific requests:**

- Emails that reference specific past meetings, proposals, or conversations from CRM \- **Snowflake**, **Verkada**, **Outfront Media**  
- Product usage data integration to inform expansion plays for existing customers \- **Frost Bank**, **Alation Inc.**, **Illumio**  
- Ability to train AI on company-specific messaging and successful email patterns \- **Softchoice**, **Concentrix**, **MaintainX**, **Brex**  
- Context-aware tone adjustment for different account stages (prospect vs customer vs at-risk) \- **The Hilb Group**, **Hylant Group**, **BDO USA**

**Priority:** **High**

**Rationale:** Request volume increased (9 accounts in Nov 18-Dec 1 vs 12 this period), making this the most-requested enhancement. Current AI content works for cold outbound but fails for account management teams working existing customers. This directly impacts the 54% of customers who showed interest in AI-generated outreach—they want it but need it to be more contextually intelligent.

#### Theme \#5: Direct Salesloft/Outreach Integration with Tracking

**Status:** ↑ Increasing significantly  
**Requested by:** 23 accounts this period

**What customers want:** Native integration to push prioritized accounts and AI-generated sequences directly into Salesloft/Outreach with full tracking of whether reps actually acted on recommendations.

**Specific requests:**

- One-click push of Workspace audiences into Outreach cadences \- **Verkada**, **Softchoice**, **Ellucian**, **MaintainX**, **Brex**  
- Tracking dashboard showing which recommendations led to rep activities \- **Frost Bank**, **Chainalysis**, **The Hilb Group**  
- Preserve template tracking when sellers customize AI-generated content \- **Outfront Media**, **Cvent**, **BDO USA**  
- Bidirectional sync showing Outreach/Salesloft activity back in Workspace \- **GAF Corp.**, **Textron Aviation**, **World Wide Technology**

**Priority:** **Critical**

**Rationale:** This exploded as the top request (8 accounts in Nov 18-Dec 1 vs 23 this period—nearly 3x increase). With 27 calls asking about Outreach/Salesloft integration, this is now both the \#1 question AND \#1 feature request. The frequency indicates this is the primary technical blocker to adoption. Customers see Workspace as valuable but can't adopt it if it doesn't connect to their core sales execution platform. This should be absolute highest priority for product development.

#### Theme \#6: Configurable User Assignment & Account Access Controls

**Status:** → Stable **Requested by:** 5 accounts this period

**What customers want:** Flexible deployment options allowing admins to control which users see which accounts in Workspace based on territory, role, segment, or custom Salesforce fields rather than account-wide deployment.

**Specific requests:**

- Support for SDRs without direct account ownership but tied via custom fields \- **MaintainX**, **Applied Innovation**  
- Territory-based filtering so reps only see accounts in their patch \- **Mastercard Inc.**, **The Hilb Group**  
- Segment-specific deployment (enterprise vs. transactional teams) \- **Hylant Group**

**Priority:** **Medium**

**Rationale:** Consistent low volume (5 accounts both periods) indicates this is nice-to-have for complex sales org structures. Workarounds exist (Studio audiences with filtering), but lack of granular control limits use cases and increases noise for sellers seeing irrelevant accounts.

### 🔸 NEW FEATURE REQUESTS THIS PERIOD

#### Theme: Mobile-First Experience for Field Sellers

**Requested by:** 7 accounts

**What customers want:** Full Workspace functionality optimized for mobile devices so field sellers, customer success managers, and account executives can access account intelligence, AI-generated talking points, and next best actions while traveling or meeting customers on-site.

**Specific requests:**

- Native mobile app with offline capability for account research \- **Vision Service Plan**, **Textron Aviation**  
- Voice-to-text for capturing meeting notes directly into Workspace \- **The Hilb Group**, **Deposco**  
- Quick-action buttons for common mobile tasks (log call, update stage, request intro) \- **GAF Corp.**, **R.R. Donnelley**  
- Geolocation-aware account suggestions for field sellers \- **Applied Innovation**, **AssetWatch**

**Priority:** **Evaluate**

**Rationale:** First appearance as a theme (7 accounts) suggests emerging need as field sales organizations return to in-person selling post-pandemic. This wasn't mentioned in previous periods, indicating either: (1) new customer segments (field-heavy orgs) in pipeline, or (2) growing expectation that B2B tools must have mobile parity. Worth monitoring if this persists next period before committing to major mobile development.

#### Theme: Workspace-Specific Analytics & Reporting

**Requested by:** 10 accounts

**What customers want:** Dedicated reporting dashboards showing Workspace adoption metrics, seller engagement patterns, which AI-generated recommendations led to closed deals, and ROI measurement specific to Workspace usage rather than general ZoomInfo platform usage.

**Specific requests:**

- Dashboard showing which sellers actively use Workspace daily vs weekly vs not at all \- **Brex**, **Outfront Media**, **World Wide Technology**  
- ROI reporting connecting Workspace usage to pipeline created and deals closed \- **QXO**, **Frost Bank**  
- A/B testing capabilities to measure AI-generated emails vs seller-written emails \- **Cvent**, **MaintainX**  
- Usage heatmaps showing which Workspace features are most/least adopted \- **Textron Aviation**, **PlainID**, **Illumio**, **Applied Innovation**

**Priority:** **High**

**Rationale:** This is a new theme (10 accounts) that didn't appear in previous periods. The emergence suggests customers moving from "will this work?" (integration questions) to "how do we prove it works?" (ROI measurement). This is a positive signal indicating customer maturity and serious adoption consideration. Lack of usage analytics was mentioned as adoption blocker in previous cycles; customers explicitly stating they need this to justify continued investment means this should be prioritized.
