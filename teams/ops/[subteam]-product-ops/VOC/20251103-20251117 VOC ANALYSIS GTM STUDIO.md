6% EARLY EXPLORATORY (8 calls) 
Accounts: March Networks, Responsive.io, Blueshift, ECI Software Solutions, Avanti Software, PCS Software, Spekit, Mangoapps

Polite interest but no clear next step - significant blockers present such as budget constraints, timing issues, or fundamental misalignment with needs

Additional Validation Metrics:

58% of engaged accounts (74 calls) had full detailed analysis with specific what resonated, pain points, questions, and feature requests documented
Strong forward intent accounts showed consistent patterns: operational pain points with existing tools, RevOps/Ops teams seeking automation, and desire to reduce seller burden through pre-built audiences
SECTION 1: WHAT WE LEARNED
✅ WHAT'S RESONATING
Pre-Packaged Seller Activation - Removing the Thinking Burden

The concept of doing analysis at scale and delivering pre-packaged, actionable recommendations directly to sellers strongly resonates across accounts. Customers consistently value the "furniture pre-assembled" approach where RevOps builds sophisticated audiences and sellers simply execute.

Example from Twilio (https://chorus.ai/meeting/B29F7309EF34478FA97E9DED6A03ADF3): "save them time and just tell them where to focus why I give them the tools...as much as you can save time that you can just bring in more more Revenue."

Also seen with: Berlin Packaging, Perficient, IWCO Direct, Masis Staffing Solutions

Data Consolidation - Single Source of Truth

The ability to aggregate data from multiple sources (ZoomInfo, Salesforce, intent signals, website visitors, conversation intelligence, data warehouses) into one centralized workbook eliminates fragmentation and creates a unified command center for 2GTM operations.

Example from Curvature LLC (https://chorus.ai/meeting/CC523B4CA9694497B5AACD5757A31047): "feels much more customizable as well as in terms of like, data sources and where data is coming from" compared to existing DemandBase solution

Also seen with: Venturis Capital, Island, Sigma Computing, IQVIA, Citizens Financial

ZoomInfo's Proprietary Data as Differentiated Moat

Customers explicitly recognize that ZoomInfo's unique data access creates capabilities competitors cannot replicate, particularly around intent data, technographics, and company/contact enrichment.

Example from Nextiva (https://chorus.ai/meeting/9DC007DF97CC4A27B06ED3AB7250620F): "you exactly match what we are building" and "we don't have access to your Data. So you are in a position where we cannot do what you did."

Also seen with: HubSpot, Transmit Security, Infor, Veritiv

Conversation Intelligence Integration - Semantic Analysis of Call Transcripts

The ability to query sales call transcripts semantically to extract competitive mentions, pain points, and buying signals captivates technical buyers who understand the complexity of this problem.

Example from Sigma Computing (https://chorus.ai/meeting/0F94C17781F74707BD39DADF2516E2C7): "one customer had spent 3.5 years with 18 data scientists trying to solve this exact problem" - identifies this as a major differentiator

Also seen with: Twilio, IWCO Direct, GitHub, Canto

Self-Service Autonomy - Breaking Free from Vendor Services

The ability to refine lists and build audiences independently without going through multiple iteration cycles with ZoomInfo's data services team eliminates workflow friction.

Example from CoStar Group (https://chorus.ai/meeting/797739475CE44B93AFCFC2CEE77D248E): "I could do it all myself" versus "a dozen turns" with "pdfs of here's our sensitivity... it's a lot of turns"

Also seen with: G2, Amazon Web Services, Gartner, Bombardier

Contact Suppression & Net New Prospecting

The capability to suppress existing CRM contacts and only surface net new prospects addresses a clear operational need for organizations trying to expand within target accounts efficiently.

Example from Curvature LLC (https://chorus.ai/meeting/CC523B4CA9694497B5AACD5757A31047): "suppress every contact that currently exists in say dynamics, for example, and then you're only presented with the list of net new prospects"

Also seen with: Island, QuickBase, Arrive Logistics, Veritiv

AI-Generated Fields & Custom Scoring Models

The ability to use AI to create custom columns (summarizing Gong calls, extracting pain points, generating talk tracks) and build sophisticated scoring models resonates with data-driven organizations.

Example from Cutover (https://chorus.ai/meeting/759D09AFC2404BBC8904525D1277F051): The "summary of engagements" pulling from Gong call data and pain points derived from activity logs aligned with their sophisticated data orchestration goals

Also seen with: Twilio, Perficient, CoStar, SurveyMonkey, Specright

CRM Sync & Bi-Directional Data Flow

The ability to pull Salesforce data into Studio audiences (account IDs, health scores, owner fields) and push refined audiences back creates a seamless workflow that keeps sellers in their primary system.

Example from SurveyMonkey (https://chorus.ai/meeting/17CC49300884427B9C04A87C7E09FCED): The successful test where newly-created Salesforce account IDs synced back validated the end-to-end integration: "That's awesome... I'm feeling good about waiting to tomorrow to just see how it shows up."

Also seen with: Perficient, IWCO Direct, Berlin Packaging, Outfront Media
❌ WHAT'S NOT WORKING

Pricing Opacity & No Trial Period

The $30-50K annual commitment without a trial period creates immediate tension, particularly for organizations that need hands-on validation before committing budget.

Example from Nextiva (https://chorus.ai/meeting/9DC007DF97CC4A27B06ED3AB7250620F): "this for the discussion would not go very far" because they had been "looking for a trial period" to validate internally. The $31,000 commitment without POC availability damaged trust.

Pattern across 8 accounts: Nextiva, March Networks, Avanti Software, Blueshift, Responsive.io, ECI Software, Spekit

Perceived Overlap with Copilot - Differentiation Unclear

Customers who recently renewed Copilot struggle to understand why they need Studio and what incremental value justifies an additional $30-50K investment on top of existing ZoomInfo spend.

Example from March Networks (https://chorus.ai/meeting/D2C749C7CFCF47C190EBA601C3E62F3C): "this information is already on the company page... I don't really understand why I need to see it in a spreadsheet view" and "we just re upped on Copilot and then we're hearing oh, well, but Copilot doesn't have all these data sources."

Pattern across 6 accounts: March Networks, Responsive.io, Blueshift, Spekit, ECI Software

Integration Export Order Breaks Downstream Automation

Studio's export field order doesn't align with how third-party tools (like RingLead) read fields sequentially, causing territory stamping and routing automation to fail.

Example from SurveyMonkey (https://chorus.ai/meeting/17CC49300884427B9C04A87C7E09FCED): "Studio's export order didn't align with how their RingLead automation reads fields sequentially," requiring manual intervention from business systems team to fix

Pattern across 3 accounts: SurveyMonkey, IWCO Direct, Arrive Logistics

Organizational Readiness Gap - "Too Advanced for Current Capabilities"

Customers express that AI features are "way ahead" of what their teams can currently execute on, creating concern about adoption risk and wasted investment.

Example from Venturis Capital (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C4B0ED16666544439F703606EAFB227D): Kyle stated the AI features are "way ahead of what we're capable of doing right now," signaling organizational readiness concerns despite conceptual interest

Pattern across 7 accounts: Venturis Capital, March Networks, Avanti Software, PCS Software, Mangoapps

Data Quality Concerns Undermine Trust

Reports of deteriorating data accuracy over the past 3-6 months create fundamental trust issues that prevent customers from investing in additional products.

Example from Venturis Capital (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C4B0ED16666544439F703606EAFB227D): "the information is really gone down hill in the last 3 to 6 months" with examples like "that person has never worked for our business. I don't know where you got that name from"

Pattern across 4 accounts: Venturis Capital, Flock Freight, YOH US, MarkMonitor

Political Resistance - Existing Vendor Relationships

Internal business relationships with competitors (particularly Clay as a customer) create institutional resistance unrelated to product quality.

Example from Sigma Computing (https://chorus.ai/meeting/0F94C17781F74707BD39DADF2516E2C7): "Clay is a big spending customer of ours and our go to market engineer and our Data team, like love Clay. Like we speak at [their] conference." This commercial relationship creates fundamental adoption barriers.

Pattern across 3 accounts: Sigma Computing, Grata, Jalasoft

Question: What's different from 6sense or Demandbase? Why not just use our existing intent platform? Asked in: 8 calls - Curvature LLC, iVision, ConnectWise, Flock Freight, Assent, Citizens Financial, KnowBe4, Bombardier
One-Off Questions (Asked 1-2 times)
"Can you pick up website visitors who don't fill forms or login?" - Outfront Media (https://chorus.ai/meeting/2F13248727A7408CB8B7E1E677D912E7), iVision

"Does this have integration with Seismic for content management?" - Outfront Media (https://chorus.ai/meeting/2F13248727A7408CB8B7E1E677D912E7)

"Can we do fuzzy matching on company names without ZoomInfo IDs?" - CoStar Group (https://chorus.ai/meeting/797739475CE44B93AFCFC2CEE77D248E), Veritiv

"What's the best practice - reps building their own views or admin-configured?" - Sigma Computing (https://chorus.ai/meeting/0F94C17781F74707BD39DADF2516E2C7)

"Can we track reverse job changes - people moving FROM customers TO targets?" - Cutover (https://chorus.ai/meeting/759D09AFC2404BBC8904525D1277F051), CoStar

"Does this work for field sales territory planning with geographic filters?" - Venturis Capital (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C4B0ED16666544439F703606EAFB227D)
SECTION 3: OBJECTION HANDLING
Objection Theme #1: Pricing Without Trial/POC (Raised in 8 calls)
What customers said:

"this for the discussion would not go very far" because we were "looking for a trial period" - Nextiva (https://chorus.ai/meeting/9DC007DF97CC4A27B06ED3AB7250620F)

"$50K represents massive overkill for our situation... if it were a $5,000 add-on to Copilot, not an issue" - March Networks (https://chorus.ai/meeting/D2C749C7CFCF47C190EBA601C3E62F3C)

"we need to demonstrate what will be the tool that our People will be using in the next few years" through hands-on testing first - Nextiva (https://chorus.ai/meeting/9DC007DF97CC4A27B06ED3AB7250620F)

Pattern: The $30-50K annual commitment without POC availability creates immediate resistance. Customers need hands-on validation with a small pilot team before committing budget, particularly when they can't predict credit consumption patterns without actual usage experience. The absence of trial options is blocking deals that have genuine product-market fit.
Objection Theme #2: Overlap/Differentiation from Copilot (Raised in 8 calls)
What customers said:

"this information is already on the company page... I don't really understand why I need to see it in a spreadsheet view" - March Networks (https://chorus.ai/meeting/D2C749C7CFCF47C190EBA601C3E62F3C)

"we just re upped on Copilot and then we're hearing oh, well, but Copilot doesn't have all these data sources" - March Networks (https://chorus.ai/meeting/D2C749C7CFCF47C190EBA601C3E62F3C)

"What's the overlap with Copilot and then the differentiation between this and Copilot?" - March Networks (https://chorus.ai/meeting/D2C749C7CFCF47C190EBA601C3E62F3C)

Pattern: Customers who recently renewed Copilot feel like they're being upsold on features they thought they already purchased. The value proposition for Studio as a separate SKU versus enhanced Copilot functionality isn't landing clearly. Timing is particularly poor when Copilot renewals just happened.
Objection Theme #3: Data Quality Deterioration (Raised in 4 calls)
What customers said:

"the information is really gone down hill in the last 3 to 6 months compared to when they first come on the program" - Venturis Capital (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C4B0ED16666544439F703606EAFB227D)

"that person has never worked for our business. I don't know where you got that name from" - Venturis Capital (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C4B0ED16666544439F703606EAFB227D)

Specific examples of outdated information about people who have left organizations - Venturis Capital, Flock Freight, YOH US

Pattern: Reports of declining data accuracy create fundamental trust issues that prevent investment in additional products. When core platform quality is questioned, upselling premium features becomes nearly impossible. This objection blocks forward momentum entirely until data quality concerns are addressed.
Objection Theme #4: Organizational Capability Gap (Raised in 7 calls)
What customers said:

"way ahead of what we're capable of doing right now" - Venturis Capital (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C4B0ED16666544439F703606EAFB227D)

"we need to just get our users using the platform" before considering advanced features - Venturis Capital (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C4B0ED16666544439F703606EAFB227D)

"their reps won't engage with platforms... don't want to learn platforms but just want contacts and talking points served to them" - March Networks (https://chorus.ai/meeting/D2C749C7CFCF47C190EBA601C3E62F3C)

Pattern: Customers express that their teams lack the sophistication or willingness to adopt advanced features. This creates adoption risk concerns where the investment won't generate ROI because reps won't use it. The "too advanced" objection signals a maturity mismatch between product capabilities and organizational readiness.
Objection Theme #5: Existing Tool Stack Overlap (Raised in 6 calls)
What customers said:

"we looked at [RingLead] the first time... and then we started working with it and we're like wait this has got a huge learning curve... we're still sort of in that learning curve" - Curvature LLC (https://chorus.ai/meeting/CC523B4CA9694497B5AACD5757A31047)

"we also use SalesWings, a third-party Salesforce module that brings in a lot of other data sources into Salesforce and then scores at an account and contact level" - March Networks (https://chorus.ai/meeting/D2C749C7CFCF47C190EBA601C3E62F3C)

"might be redundant given their existing Outreach implementation" - Curvature LLC (https://chorus.ai/meeting/CC523B4CA9694497B5AACD5757A31047)

Pattern: Customers have already invested in tools that provide overlapping capabilities. They're experiencing learning curve fatigue and are hesitant to add another complex platform when they haven't fully optimized existing investments. The burden of proof for "must replace X tool" is very high.
Objection Theme #6: Political Resistance from Existing Vendor Relationships (Raised in 3 calls)
What customers said:

"Clay is a big spending customer of ours and our go to market engineer and our Data team, like love Clay. Like we speak at [their] conference." - Sigma Computing (https://chorus.ai/meeting/0F94C17781F74707BD39DADF2516E2C7)

Commercial relationships with competitive products create institutional resistance unrelated to product quality - Sigma Computing, Grata, Jalasoft

Pattern: Business relationships where competitors are customers or partners create political barriers that product superiority alone cannot overcome. These objections are particularly difficult because the resistance isn't based on capability gaps but on business relationships and internal politics.
Objection Theme #7: IT Governance & Data Security Concerns (Raised in 3 calls)
What customers said:

"IT team is very protective slash hesitant to do anything outside of our own data systems or they want to be able to retain it all...they want it all be within our walls" - Curvature LLC (https://chorus.ai/meeting/CC523B4CA9694497B5AACD5757A31047)

Cloud-based data orchestration conflicts with IT policies requiring data remain on-premise - Curvature LLC, Citizens Financial, Bombardier

Pattern: IT governance policies that require data remain within organizational walls prevent adoption of cloud-based platforms regardless of capabilities. These objections require executive-level security reviews and are deal-killers without IT buy-in.
================================================================================ SECTION 4: PRODUCT FEEDBACK
Theme #1: Outreach & Salesloft Native Integration (15 accounts requested)
What customers want: Direct, bi-directional integration with Outreach and Salesloft that allows audiences to flow seamlessly from Studio into cadences without manual CSV export/import, and activity data to flow back for reporting.

Specific requests:

Push audiences directly into Outreach cadences with field mapping - Curvature LLC (https://chorus.ai/meeting/CC523B4CA9694497B5AACD5757A31047), iVision, ConnectWise, SundaySky, Transmit Security

Pull Outreach/Salesloft activity data back into Studio for engagement tracking - IWCO Direct, Masis Staffing, QuickBase, CoStar

Maintain talk tracks and personalization from Studio into sequence templates - Outfront Media (https://chorus.ai/meeting/2F13248727A7408CB8B7E1E677D912E7), Berlin Packaging, Specright

Priority: HIGH Rationale: This integration is mentioned in 15 calls as a critical workflow gap. Current manual export/import creates friction that undermines the automation value proposition. This is blocking deals where Outreach/Salesloft is the primary engagement layer.
Theme #2: On-Demand Refresh Button (8 accounts requested)
What customers want: The ability to trigger data refresh on-demand rather than waiting for nightly batch processing, particularly when launching time-sensitive campaigns or needing immediate Salesforce sync validation.

Specific requests:

Real-time refresh for campaign launches - SurveyMonkey (https://chorus.ai/meeting/17CC49300884427B9C04A87C7E09FCED), QuickBase, Specright, Assent

Validate CRM sync immediately after configuration changes - SurveyMonkey, IWCO Direct, Berlin Packaging

Refresh specific workbooks without full system-wide refresh - Specright, QuickBase

Priority: HIGH
Rationale: The nightly-only batch refresh creates workflow friction when customers need immediate validation or have time-sensitive campaign deadlines. This is particularly painful for early adopters trying to validate configurations and causing support ticket volume.
Theme #3: 6sense & Demandbase Intent Data Integration (10 accounts requested)
What customers want: Native connectors to pull intent signals from 6sense and Demandbase for organizations already invested in these platforms, rather than requiring migration to ZoomInfo's intent data.

Specific requests:

6sense intent topics and keyword tracking integration - iVision, ConnectWise, Flock Freight, Assent

Demandbase account engagement scores - Curvature LLC (https://chorus.ai/meeting/CC523B4CA9694497B5AACD5757A31047), Citizens Financial, KnowBe4, Bombardier

Preserve existing intent scoring models without re-training - ConnectWise, Assent

Priority: MEDIUM Rationale: Requested by 10 accounts but represents existing platform investment that creates switching cost resistance. Important for competitive displacement scenarios but not blocking deals where ZoomInfo intent is acceptable.
Theme #4: Clearer UI for "Run Enrichment" vs "Refresh" (6 accounts requested)
What customers want: Redesigned interface that makes the distinction between "run enrichment" (empty cells only) and "refresh" (full re-processing) immediately obvious, with clear guidance on when to use each.

Specific requests:

Separate buttons with clear labeling and tooltips - SurveyMonkey (https://chorus.ai/meeting/17CC49300884427B9C04A87C7E09FCED), QuickBase, Assent

Warning prompt before refresh explaining the difference - SurveyMonkey, IWCO Direct

Status indicator showing last refresh time vs last enrichment time - Specright, QuickBase

Priority: HIGH Rationale: This UX confusion is creating support tickets and workflow blockages across early adopters. It's a quick fix that will reduce friction significantly and lower support burden. Jagannath explicitly acknowledged this needs to be cleaned up.
Theme #5: Predictable Export Field Ordering (4 accounts requested)
What customers want: Control over field export order or standardized ordering that aligns with common downstream automation tools (RingLead, routing engines, territory assignment workflows).

Specific requests:

Configure export column order in settings - SurveyMonkey (https://chorus.ai/meeting/17CC49300884427B9C04A87C7E09FCED), IWCO Direct, Arrive Logistics

Template library for common integrations (RingLead, LeanData, etc.) - SurveyMonkey, Arrive Logistics

Priority: MEDIUM Rationale: Impacts 4 accounts with sophisticated RevOps processes using downstream automation. Workaround exists (manual field reordering) but creates fragile workflows. Important for enterprise segment but not blocking initial adoption.
Theme #6: Conversation Intelligence Platform Integration Beyond Gong (5 accounts requested)
What customers want: Native integration with Chorus.ai, Clari, and other conversation intelligence platforms beyond Gong for semantic analysis of call transcripts.

Specific requests:

Chorus.ai connector for call transcript analysis - Cutover (https://chorus.ai/meeting/759D09AFC2404BBC8904525D1277F051), GitHub, Canto

Clari/Troops integration for pipeline signals - HubSpot, Gartner

Priority: EVALUATE Rationale: Requested by 5 accounts but represents competing/overlapping platforms. Gong integration covers majority of market. May be important for specific enterprise deals but not broadly blocking.
Theme #7: Dynamic Territory Assignment & Account Ownership (7 accounts requested)
What customers want: Automated territory re-assignment as accounts grow, change ICP fit, or as org structures evolve, rather than manual re-distribution of audiences.

Specific requests:

Rule-based territory assignment (e.g., "accounts >1000 employees go to enterprise team") - Berlin Packaging, Perficient, IWCO Direct

Trigger-based reassignment when account characteristics change - Masis Staffing, CoStar, HubSpot

Conflict resolution when multiple reps claim same account - Berlin Packaging, Gartner

Priority: MEDIUM Rationale: Important for organizations with complex territory rules but represents advanced capability that can be handled manually in early stages. Nice-to-have for enterprise segment.
