## Executive Summary {#executive-summary}

### Report Overview

This report analyzes voice-of-customer data from **961 call transcripts** with new business prospects, representing **694 unique accounts** across two segments:

- **Mid-Market (100-999 employees):** 637 calls from 501 accounts  
- **Enterprise/Strategic (1,000+ employees):** 324 calls from 193 accounts

The analysis extracts competitive intelligence from actual customer conversations to understand:

- Which competitors are showing up in deals and how frequently  
- What prospects like and dislike about competitor products  
- Why prospects are evaluating alternatives to ZoomInfo  
- Feedback on ZoomInfo's data quality and coverage

### Key Findings

**Competitive Landscape:**

- **Apollo dominates with 316 mentions** overall, with significant segment variation (38% of Mid-Market calls vs 22.8% of Enterprise/Strategic)  
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** remains entrenched baseline (141 mentions, stronger in Enterprise at 16.7% vs 13.7% Mid-Market)  
- **Gong outpaces Chorus** 94 to 24 mentions across both segments  
- **Clay emerging** as workflow automation threat (91 mentions, slightly higher in Mid-Market at 10%)

**Primary Evaluation Drivers:**

- **87% cite feature/capability gaps** \- prospects need sales engagement functionality, better revenue intelligence, and workflow automation  
- **Pricing sensitivity varies by segment** \- 83.8% of Mid-Market calls mention cost/budget vs 50.6% of Enterprise/Strategic calls  
- **Scale/licensing concerns higher in Enterprise** \- 28.4% of Enterprise calls vs 22.6% of Mid-Market mention seat/licensing issues  
- **27% cite data quality concerns** \- though when ZoomInfo data is tested head-to-head, it consistently wins

**The Paradox:** ZoomInfo's data quality wins in direct comparisons across both segments, but deals are lost before reaching the testing phase. Mid-Market loses primarily on pricing friction, while Enterprise/Strategic loses on capability gaps and licensing model limitations.

**Data Quality Feedback:**

- Strong positive sentiment when prospects test the data: "The clear pick was ZoomInfo. Full stop for all of us"  
- Signature scanning methodology resonates as differentiator across segments  
- Coverage gaps mentioned primarily in SMB hospitality, international markets, and specific vertical segments  
- Intent and website visitor intelligence highly valued when demonstrated

## Critical Competitor Limitations {#critical-competitor-limitations}

### What Prospects Dislike About Competitors

#### Apollo

**Data Quality Inconsistency:**

- "Mix of hits and misses," "very wishy washy depending on who I was talking to"  
- Segment variability \- works adequately for some use cases, fails in others  
- International coverage particularly weak  
- No email validation or phone verification mechanisms

**Limited Functionality:**

"Just uses it to pull contact info" \- no targeting sophistication, triggers, or intent signals

**Additional Limitations:**

- Manual lookup process vs workflow integration  
- Basic sequences lack sophistication  
- Limited integration with enterprise sales stack  
- No intent signals or buying intelligence

**Segment Insight:** Data quality concerns expressed across both segments, though Enterprise prospects more likely to conduct rigorous testing and identify gaps.

#### Lusha

**Email Deliverability Issues:**

"Approximately 50% bounce rates that risk getting the organization banned from target companies due to excessive invalid emails"

This represents a compliance and reputation risk across both segments.

**Quality Inconsistency:**

- "Very wishy washy depending on who I was talking to"  
- Works for some users/segments, not others  
- Unpredictable results

**Limited Platform Capabilities:**

- Basic contact lookup only  
- No workflow automation or integration  
- No intent signals or buying intelligence  
- Manual process doesn't scale

**Segment Insight:** Email deliverability problem creates identical replacement opportunity across Mid-Market and Enterprise segments.

#### Bombora (accessed via partners)

**Weekly Refresh Limitations:**

- Weekly data refresh cycle vs ZoomInfo's 15-minute streaming intent updates  
- Third-party access constraints \- cannot access advanced features when purchasing through partners  
- Limited functionality compared to direct subscription

**Testing Results:**

"When he tested Apollo with 50 banks from his target list, zero showed buyer intent, which seemed implausible for active banking prospects"

**Segment Pattern:** Mid-Market primarily accesses through partners (lower cost), experiencing limited functionality. Enterprise either uses direct Bombora or evaluates ZoomInfo as alternative.

#### Gong

**Complexity Concerns:**

"Seemed like there was too much going on... appeared overly robust, trying to show every bell and whistle rather than focusing on core functionality"

**Implementation Requirements:**

- Significant setup and configuration needed  
- Extensive training required for adoption  
- Long time-to-value compared to simpler alternatives

**Pricing Considerations:**

- Premium pricing creates budget challenges  
- Difficult to justify ROI for smaller teams

**Segment Insight:** Complexity concerns appear more frequently in Mid-Market feedback, while Enterprise teams more comfortable with implementation requirements.

#### 6sense

**Implementation and Visibility Issues:**

"Having a 'not so good experience with 6sense'" "Waiting over a year to see what their team will actually do with the new toolset and still has very little visibility"

**Key Limitations:**

- Lack of transparency into platform capabilities  
- Long implementation delays  
- Results "presented" rather than direct access  
- Company-level intent only (not person-level)

**Cost-Value Concerns:**

- Premium pricing ($50K+ typically)  
- Difficulty demonstrating concrete value  
- Long payback period

**Segment Insight:** 6sense appears primarily in Enterprise (13.3% vs 8.5% Mid-Market), with dissatisfaction creating replacement opportunity specifically in Enterprise segment.

#### Cognism

**Limited Comparative Feedback:** Most mentions in context of "running tests against ZoomInfo" without detailed critique. Testing suggests prospects questioning data quality claims, with competitive validation in progress.

#### LinkedIn Sales Navigator

**Process Limitations:**

- Manual, time-consuming research process  
- No automation or bulk enrichment  
- Export limitations and integration friction  
- Coverage limited to LinkedIn profile data  
- No buying signals or intent data

**Scale Limitations:**

"Takes 20-40 minutes per account" for manual research \- doesn't scale for territory coverage

**Segment Insight:** Limitations consistent across segments, though Enterprise teams more likely to need automation due to larger territories and account volumes.

#### Clay

**Data Quality Dependencies:**

- No proprietary data \- quality depends on underlying sources  
- When sources conflict, no verification mechanism  
- True cost accumulation when data sources added

**Complexity for Basic Needs:**

- Requires marketing ops sophistication  
- Steep learning curve for non-technical users  
- Over-engineered for basic prospecting use cases

**Maintenance Requirements:**

- Custom workflows require ongoing maintenance  
- Breaking changes when providers update APIs

## ZoomInfo Positioning & Gaps {#zoominfo-positioning-&-gaps}

### Why Prospects Are Evaluating Alternatives

This section analyzes the drivers behind prospect evaluation of competitors, revealing gaps in ZoomInfo's positioning, product capabilities, and go-to-market approach.

#### Primary Evaluation Driver: Feature & Capability Gaps (87% of evaluations)

**Cross-Segment Pattern:**

- Mid-Market: 1,016 gap mentions in 637 calls (159.5% \- multiple per call)  
- Enterprise/Strategic: 500 gap mentions in 324 calls (154.3%)

Feature gaps drive evaluations consistently across both segments, with similar types of needs expressed.

**Sales Engagement Missing:**

Prospects express need for execution capabilities beyond contact data:

"Need both the data AND the ability to execute outbound in one platform"

**Specific Gaps Identified:**

- Multi-touch sequence automation (Salesloft/Outreach functionality)  
- Email tracking and reply detection  
- Cadence management and follow-up automation  
- Engagement analytics and A/B testing  
- Template libraries and best practice playbooks

**Segment Insight:** Sales engagement gap mentioned at 16.2% in Mid-Market vs 20.7% in Enterprise/Strategic \- Enterprise teams express higher need for sophisticated sequencing.

**Revenue Intelligence Shortfall:**

Gong dominating Chorus 94 to 24 mentions (4:1 ratio) reveals gap:

"Chorus seemed like just a recording and transcript... I can get that with Gong and I can get that with \[others\]"

**Functional Gaps vs Gong:**

- Forecasting capabilities not demonstrated or insufficient  
- Deal inspection and risk identification missing  
- Rep coaching insights limited compared to Gong  
- Platform approach vs feature positioning

**Segment Insight:** Pattern consistent across segments (MM: 9.4% Gong vs \~4% Chorus, Enterprise: 10.5% vs \~4%).

**Workflow Automation Gap:**

Clay capturing use cases ZoomInfo doesn't address:

**What Prospects Need:**

- No-code workflow builder for marketing ops personas  
- Ability to chain: research → enrich → score → route → engage  
- Template library for common plays  
- Flexibility to customize without engineering resources

**Segment Insight:** Slightly higher need in Mid-Market (10% Clay mentions) vs Enterprise (8.3%) \- resource constraints drive no-code automation needs.

**ABM & Intent Sophistication:**

**Person-Level Intent Gap:**

- Need to identify individuals showing buying behavior, not just accounts  
- Department or team-level signals for multi-persona buying committees  
- Role-based intent for different stakeholders

**Predictive Limitations:**

- Want "who will buy" modeling, not just "who is researching"  
- Propensity scoring based on behavioral patterns  
- Early-stage buying signals before active research

**Custom Intent Complexity:**

"A lot of the other tools I see don't really have custom intent... the more specific the better for my use case"

- Data science involvement required for custom topics  
- Testing "viability" creates barriers  
- Limited flexibility compared to prospect needs

**Segment Insight:** Intent sophistication needs higher in Enterprise (13.3% mention 6sense/DemandBase) vs Mid-Market (8.5%).

**API & Technical Integration:**

**Technical Gaps Identified:**

"API integration is our preferred approach but we've been using email delivery"

- Rate limits blocking scale use cases  
- Webhook capabilities for real-time data sync  
- Direct CRM enrichment workflows difficult to implement  
- Developer experience and documentation gaps

**Segment Insight:** API/integration concerns more common in Enterprise segment due to scale requirements and existing technical infrastructure.

#### Secondary Driver: Cost & Budget Constraints (Segment-Dependent)

**Significant Segment Variation:**

- Mid-Market: 534 pricing mentions (83.8% of calls)  
- Enterprise/Strategic: 164 pricing mentions (50.6% of calls)

**33 percentage point gap** demonstrates pricing sensitivity varies substantially by segment.

**Mid-Market Budget Reality:**

"The pricing was way out of what we could afford" "Budget is not even a line item... funds pulled from other systems"

**Typical Mid-Market Budgets:**

- Available budget: $10K-25K annual for sales intelligence stack  
- ZoomInfo quotes: $24K-36K for 5-10 seats  
- Alternative stack comparison: Apollo ($1.2K) \+ Clay ($3K) \+ Bombora partner ($5K) \= $9K total

**Value Justification Challenge:**

"Is ZoomInfo's stronger data set worth 10-20x the price?"

- Freemium alternatives (Apollo) allow testing before commitment  
- ZoomInfo requires commitment before proving value at scale  
- Difficulty demonstrating ROI before purchase

**Enterprise/Strategic Pricing Approach:**

"Is ZoomInfo's stronger data set worth the cost?" \- value justification question, not absolute affordability

**Enterprise Budget Considerations:**

- Budget reallocation from other systems  
- ROI demonstration requirements more rigorous  
- Renewal friction when economic pressures hit  
- Not "can't afford" but "is it worth it?"

**Per-Seat Licensing Problems (More Pronounced in Enterprise):**

**Scale Licensing Mentions:**

- Mid-Market: 144 mentions (22.6% of calls)  
- Enterprise/Strategic: 92 mentions (28.4% of calls)

"If I suddenly started leveraging a license basis, it's just not sustainable with over 1,000 recruiters"

**Enterprise Scale Issues:**

- 1,000+ user organizations find per-seat model expensive  
- Prevents democratization across full revenue team  
- Forced rationing: "new business only" vs account management and customer success  
- Multiple divisions/regions needing coordination

**Organizational Complexity (Enterprise-Specific):**

"Multiple acquisitions \= multiple contracts \= complexity"

**Enterprise Challenges:**

- Acquired companies with separate ZoomInfo contracts  
- Regional operations requiring coordination  
- Marketing and Sales using different products (MarketingOS vs SalesOS)  
- Co-terming renewals across business units

#### Tertiary Driver: Data Quality & Coverage Concerns (27% of evaluations)

**Important Context:** When ZoomInfo data is tested head-to-head, it consistently wins on quality metrics across both segments.

**Geographic Coverage Skepticism:**

**International Markets:**

- EMEA and APAC coverage questioned  
- "US-centric" perception persists  
- Regional contact format needs (mobile vs landline, country codes)

**Segment Pattern:** Enterprise teams with multi-region operations more likely to question international coverage, though skepticism exists in both segments.

**Segment-Specific Coverage Gaps:**

**SMB & Hospitality:**

"Hard to reach GMs and owners at independent hotels"

- Small independent businesses challenging  
- Non-traditional org structures  
- Limited digital presence

**Startups & High-Growth:**

- New companies take time to populate database  
- Fast-growing companies with rapid hiring create data decay  
- Emerging market segments slower coverage

**Data Freshness & Decay:**

"People move around, especially in marketing... questioning refresh rates"

**Prospect Needs:**

- Clearer "data freshness" indicators on each contact  
- Last verified date and confidence scores  
- Transparency about verification methodology

**Verification & Validation:**

**Email Validation:**

- Never Bounce integration received positively when demonstrated  
- Email authentication requirements increasing  
- Deliverability protection becoming buying criterion

**Phone Number Verification:**

- Lusha's "phone-verified data" claim resonating  
- Mobile vs landline distinction needed  
- Direct dial vs switchboard clarity requested

#### Use Case Limitations

**Limited Utilization:**

"Strictly for contact information... just to find meeting planners and executive assistants"

**Pattern Across Segments:**

- Reactive lookup vs proactive targeting  
- Manual search vs automated workflows  
- Contact data only vs full platform intelligence

**Root Causes:**

- Lack of awareness of advanced capabilities  
- Poor onboarding focused only on basic search  
- Features not demonstrated during sales cycle  
- Complexity preventing feature discovery

**Product Breadth Confusion:**

"Not entirely sure what their tool stack they have access to"

**Awareness Gaps:**

- Even existing users don't understand full product suite  
- SalesOS, MarketingOS, Chorus seen as separate vs integrated platform  
- Advanced features (intent, enrichment, Copilot) not discovered

**Segment Insight:** Product breadth confusion appears more pronounced in Enterprise segment due to multiple products and more complex organizational structures.

**Current State:**

- Freshness not immediately visible to users  
- Verification methodology not transparent  
- Refresh cycles not communicated clearly

**Budget vs Preference Paradox:**

"Budget is not even a line item... ZoomInfo is my preference but $15K budget far below pricing"

**Pattern Particularly in Mid-Market:**

- Data quality praised and preferred  
- Testing shows ZoomInfo superiority  
- Yet deals lost due to pricing before demonstrating value

**User Preference:**

"My team loves it"

**Budget Reality:**

"Way out of what we could afford"

This disconnect reveals data quality alone insufficient to overcome pricing objections, particularly in Mid-Market segment where budget constraints are more pronounced.

## Appendix: Analysis Methodology {#appendix:-analysis-methodology}

**Data Source:**

- 961 demo and discovery call transcripts from new business prospects  
- Date range: December 2025 \- January 2026  
- Unique accounts: 694

**Segment Distribution:**

- Mid-Market (100-999 employees): 637 calls from 501 accounts  
- Enterprise (1,000-5,000 employees): 238 calls from 162 accounts  
- Strategic (5,000+ employees): 86 calls from 31 accounts  
- **Combined Enterprise/Strategic for analysis:** 324 calls from 193 accounts

**Analysis Approach:**

- Automated extraction of competitor mentions and product feedback from structured fields  
- Thematic coding of qualitative responses across five dimensions:  
  - Competitors mentioned (880 non-null records)  
  - Competitor product strengths (878 non-null records)  
  - Competitor product limitations (880 non-null records)  
  - Alternative evaluation drivers (884 non-null records)  
  - ZoomInfo data feedback (887 non-null records)  
- Frequency analysis of key topics and themes by segment  
- Representative quote extraction to illustrate patterns

**Topic Frequency Counts by Segment:**

**Mid-Market (637 calls):**

- Budget/cost mentions: 534 (83.8% of calls)  
- Feature gap mentions: 1,016 (159.5% of calls)  
- Scale/licensing mentions: 144 (22.6% of calls)  
- Data quality themes: 1,287 total mentions

**Enterprise/Strategic (324 calls):**

- Budget/cost mentions: 164 (50.6% of calls)  
- Feature gap mentions: 500 (154.3% of calls)  
- Scale/licensing mentions: 92 (28.4% of calls)  
- Data quality themes: 653 total mentions

**Confidence Levels:**

- **High confidence:** Competitive landscape frequency and segment variation (large sample, consistent themes)  
- **High confidence:** Pricing sensitivity differences by segment (clear 33-point gap: 83.8% MM vs 50.6% Enterprise)  
- **High confidence:** Feature gap patterns (similar across segments, detailed articulation)  
- **High confidence:** Scale/licensing higher in Enterprise (28.4% vs 22.6% Mid-Market)  
- **Medium confidence:** Data quality patterns (limited negative feedback could indicate satisfaction OR insufficient testing exposure)  
- **Medium confidence:** Competitor product feedback (self-reported in sales context, may differ from actual usage)

**Limitations:**

- Sample represents prospects in active evaluation, not broader market  
- New business focus (expansion/renewal dynamics may differ)  
- Recency bias (recent calls potentially over-indexed vs earlier period)  
- Self-reported feedback in sales context (socially desirable responses possible)  
- Geographic skew toward North American prospects in sample  
- Strategic segment smaller (86 calls) combined with Enterprise for analysis  
- Company size ranges may overlap at boundaries (999 vs 1,000 employees)

**Key Statistical Notes:**

- Prospects mention average 1.8 competitors per conversation  
- 548 unique competitors mentioned across all conversations  
- Top 10 competitors account for 76% of all mentions  
- 92% of conversations contain substantive feedback in at least one category  
- Apollo shows strongest segment variation: 38% MM vs 22.8% Enterprise  
- Pricing mentions show 33 percentage point gap between segments  
- Feature gaps consistent at \~87% across both segments
