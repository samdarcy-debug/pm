SECTION 1: WHAT WE LEARNED
✅ WHAT'S RESONATING
AI-Powered Intelligence & Natural Language Query Capabilities

The ability to use natural language prompts to analyze data and generate insights resonated across 28 calls. Customers appreciated that Studio's AI could process complex queries without requiring technical SQL knowledge or manual analysis. The AI agent functionality for generating account plans, persona-specific messaging, and buying committee identification generated significant enthusiasm.

Example from Datarobot, Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/5DFFDF751AAD41EEABBB5200B2E66074): The Go-to-Market Studio concept strongly resonated with Erin because it directly addressed DataRobot's core challenge of data scattered across multiple silos without a unified orchestration layer. Jake's positioning of Studio as a "control tower" or "brain" that pulls from various sources (Snowflake, Salesforce, intent signals, call transcripts) aligned perfectly with Erin's stated goal of "bringing stuff from many data sources" rather than relying on a single provider. The Clay competitor use case Jake walked through—combining call transcripts, modeling data, and behavioral signals to build targeted lists—demonstrated exactly the type of sophisticated, multi-threaded workflow DataRobot wants to achieve. Erin's engagement level increased noticeably when Jake explained how Studio could automate their ideal scenario: identifying high-intent accounts, finding the right contacts, personalizing outreach at different levels for BDRs versus AEs, and pushing everything into sequences.

Data Aggregation & Unified Workspace Concept

The "single pane of glass" positioning and ability to consolidate data from multiple sources (ZoomInfo, Salesforce, Snowflake, intent signals, technographics) into unified workbooks resonated in 15 calls. Customers valued eliminating the need to toggle between multiple tools and spreadsheets.

Example from WPIC Marketing Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/A2E4EB3E8DE64566ADC5AC2AB403B557): The central command center concept for data aggregation strongly resonated with Kelly's operational pain points. She expressed clear enthusiasm about the ability to enrich data at scale without requiring individual salespeople to manually research companies one-by-one in the CRM, stating "I'm the one doing that for my whole team, right? And my whole team probably gonna be spending time in summing for doing that." The spreadsheet-based interface aligned perfectly with her stated preference for simple data manipulation, and she immediately grasped how the platform could support their ABM campaign strategy. Kelly was particularly engaged when Steve demonstrated scoring capabilities and automated email drafting, asking about being able to search company websites for "something nice something juicy" to use in personalized emails.

Orchestration & Workflow Automation

The ability to build audiences in Studio and push them to sellers or activate sequences resonated across 19 calls. Operations teams valued the capability to orchestrate plays and distribute curated lists without requiring manual handoffs.

Example from Compass Group Canada (https://chorus.ai/meeting/61E8166FC44243409163AB13D0337748): The three-tab workbook structure addressing different stages of contact and company enrichment resonated strongly with Erika, who appreciated the logical progression from contact enhancement to company validation to new contact discovery. She particularly valued the practical data enrichment features that directly solved her team's needs, including the 4-digit SIC code extraction through AI prompts, the comprehensive NAICS code inclusion (which she preferred over just selecting the first four digits), and the credit-saving functionality that recognized previously exported records and only charged for 808 new contacts instead of the full 1,959. The newly launched website visitor aggregation capability generated immediate enthusiasm, with Erika calling it a "game changer" - this addressed a long-standing request from her colleague Jen who had wanted to see all website visitors at scale rather than just individual alerts through Co-Pilot. Erika's comment "this is everything I need" after reviewing the workbook structure demonstrates strong product-market fit, and she immediately scheduled a follow-up meeting and set a December 3rd deadline for the next deliverable.

Multi-Source Data Integration

The ability to pull data from Salesforce, Snowflake, ZoomInfo, intent providers, and other sources into a single workbook resonated across 15 calls. Customers valued avoiding vendor lock-in and leveraging existing data investments.

Example from Airwallex (https://chorus.ai/meeting/5EB45BED79B446D48DF882AA597A175B): The concept of unifying disparate data sources into a single workspace strongly resonated with Vincent, who engaged actively when Steve demonstrated how Go-to-Market Studio could aggregate data from Salesforce, Snowflake, ZoomInfo, and other sources into workbooks. Vincent demonstrated clear understanding by paraphrasing back: "What you have here is a workbook of current clients and then what we can do with the Enrich feature is add more data points from various sources," showing he grasped the core value proposition. The AI-powered insights capability also captured attention, particularly when Dan explained how they could "pull in and say over the last 6 months have any of our current customers discussed Stripe or competitors that might signal threat churn risk." Vincent acknowledged that Gong's AI features were "more like template" while noting that ZoomInfo's appeared "more like free text-based" with natural language processing, suggesting he saw differentiation in the AI approach.

Time Savings & Efficiency at Scale

The ability to automate previously manual processes and operate at scale resonated across 21 calls. Customers valued eliminating repetitive research tasks and reducing time spent on data preparation.

Example from NFI Industries (https://chorus.ai/meeting/6CF70D6025FF4821B05E5B62E45A346D): The customer shows strong appreciation for ZoomInfo's consultative approach to their TAM expansion strategy. When discussing how to prioritize their 2.5 million addressable accounts, Ryan immediately engages with the concept of propensity scoring, saying they need to identify "high propensity to buy right now" combined with "larger accounts and more service lines" to determine which segment to pursue first. This strategic thinking demonstrates he values ZoomInfo as a partner in go-to-market planning, not just a data vendor. Ryan's request for a quarter-over-quarter efficiency report to present at his upcoming budget meetings reveals he sees tangible value in demonstrating ZoomInfo's ROI internally. His enthusiasm about warehouse management technology tracking and RFP monitoring capabilities suggests these specific data points align well with NFI's sales process.

Data Enrichment Capabilities

The ability to enrich existing CRM records with ZoomInfo data and append missing fields resonated across 14 calls. Customers valued filling gaps in their contact and company data without manual research.

Example from Compass Group Canada (https://chorus.ai/meeting/61E8166FC44243409163AB13D0337748): Erika particularly valued the credit-saving functionality that recognized previously exported records and only charged for 808 new contacts instead of the full 1,959. She called the website visitor aggregation capability a "game changer" because it addressed a long-standing request from her colleague Jen who had wanted to see all website visitors at scale rather than just individual alerts.

❌ WHAT'S NOT WORKING
Missing Features & Product Gaps

Across 23 calls, customers identified specific capabilities they expected or needed that Studio doesn't currently offer. These gaps ranged from missing integrations to workflow features to data types.

Example from SurveyMonkey (https://chorus.ai/meeting/17CC49300884427B9C04A87C7E09FCED): Nicholas encountered a fundamental workflow sequence problem that represents a significant technical blocker. When GTM Studio exports accounts to Salesforce before contacts are created, it triggers territory assignment rules that assign accounts to the wrong teams based on incomplete data. Then when contacts arrive later through the scheduled sync, the system can't reassign territories without manual intervention from the business systems team. Nicholas also identified critical product gaps including the need for a front-end interface for export configuration so he doesn't need CSM support for basic changes like adjusting export field mappings or scheduled sync times. The current requirement to open support tickets for what should be self-service configuration creates unnecessary friction and delays in his implementation process.

Pattern across 23 accounts: Pregis Corp. (SAP C/4C integration), TrueContext (fully integrated seller activation), Aflac (lead governance and tracking), Orca Security (more granular technographic data), Datarobot Inc. (Slack integration), IWCO Direct (specific firmographic data), WPIC Marketing Inc. (Asian market expansion data), Sift Science Inc. (first-party + third-party data marriage), Compass Group Canada (hierarchical contact prioritization), Airwallex (native engagement capabilities), Instacart (Snowflake integration at time of call), NFI Industries (competitive intelligence capabilities), FM Global (AI-powered profiling), Venturis Capital Corp. (data accuracy validation), and 9 others



Integration Complexity & CRM Compatibility

Integration challenges surfaced in 14 calls, with customers expressing concern about connecting Studio to their existing tech stack or encountering limitations with their specific CRM platform.

Example from NFI Industries (https://chorus.ai/meeting/6CF70D6025FF4821B05E5B62E45A346D): NFI faces significant operational complexity in territory assignment that creates friction in scaling their ZoomInfo usage. Ryan explains that while they want to tackle a large TAM, they're constrained by the manual nature of their account assignment process: "If there's no territory rules in place and the sales leaders are determining where accounts are going, I just don't think we should look at something that's bigger than 40 thousand." This reveals a fundamental bottleneck where sales operations bandwidth limits their ability to leverage the full data set ZoomInfo can provide. The complexity of Salesforce territory rules and the time required to set them up properly means NFI can't scale Studio usage as quickly as they'd like.

Pattern across 14 accounts: SAP C/4C compatibility issues (Pregis Corp.), Snowflake integration timing (Instacart), HubSpot integration nuances (WPIC Marketing Inc., Emburse), Salesforce territory assignment complexity (NFI Industries, SurveyMonkey), custom CRM configurations (Allied Universal, Altice Labs), API limitations (Motorola Solutions, Wells Fargo), and integration with existing data warehouses (Carta, Workday, Affirm, Guidewire)



User Adoption & Daily Workflow Concerns

In 13 calls, customers expressed skepticism about whether sellers would actually use Studio or whether it would become "shelfware." Concerns centered on whether the tool would fit into existing daily workflows.

Example from Airwallex (https://chorus.ai/meeting/5EB45BED79B446D48DF882AA597A175B): The fundamental objection centers on user adoption and daily workflow integration. Vincent articulated this concern clearly: "The sellers would rarely go to ZoomInfo—they would do it very irregularly, but not day to day... every quarter when they're territory building, territory planning, then maybe they would log into ZoomInfo. But then after that they would only just do engagement." This reveals that ZoomInfo isn't embedded in sellers' daily routines, unlike engagement tools such as Dialpad, Outreach, and potentially Gong. Vincent emphasized this challenge by stating "Gong potentially has an advantage because it's more of an engagement tool compared to Go-to-Market Studio," positioning this as a competitive weakness rather than just a feature gap. The underlying concern is that revenue operations can build sophisticated workbooks and insights, but if sellers don't naturally use ZoomInfo daily, the activation and adoption will fail.

Pattern across 13 accounts: TrueContext, Venturis Capital Corp., Sift Science Inc., Intercontinental Hotels Group, Twilio Inc., Splunk, Gartner, Highspot, IDFC FIRST Bank, Motorola Solutions, Yapi Kredi, Bosch Security Systems, Mitsubishi Electric



Pricing Concerns & Budget Constraints

Pricing emerged as an objection or concern in 13 calls. Customers expressed uncertainty about cost, questioned ROI, or indicated budget timing constraints.

Example from Venturis Capital Corp. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C4B0ED16666544439F703606EAFB227D): Kyle reported user feedback that "the information is really gone down hill in the last 3 to 6 months" and users were finding increasing instances of incorrect or outdated contact data. This data quality concern is now threatening renewal as Kyle stated they "need to just get our users using the platform more successfully in the next few months to ensure that we can justify renewing the program." The combination of declining data quality perception and falling user engagement (30% drop in active users) creates a difficult ROI narrative for Kyle to take to leadership during the renewal conversation.

Pattern across 13 accounts: Instacart, WPIC Marketing Inc., Axon Enterprise, Northrop Grumman, Markel, Ramp Financial, Carta, Jobber Software, Allied Universal, Altice Labs, Eagle Materials, Safran Electrical and Power, Cubic Corporation



Data Quality & Accuracy Concerns

In 9 calls, customers questioned the quality, accuracy, or currency of ZoomInfo's data, particularly for specialized industries or international markets.

Example from WPIC Marketing Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/A2E4EB3E8DE64566ADC5AC2AB403B557): Kelly's primary concern centers on data sufficiency and coverage, particularly for their specialized focus on companies expanding into Asian markets. She stated, "Sometimes it's not enough data, right? We're like, okay, we are just relying in some info Data and that stuff. But I also like, think if we can just open the scope." This reveals an underlying anxiety that ZoomInfo alone may not provide comprehensive enough coverage for their niche market, which is why she's exploring Clay's aggregation of multiple data vendors. Additionally, she expressed a need to validate the platform's capabilities hands-on before committing, stating "I would like just to to explore to just like see like, a small chunk of data and maybe around one campaign and see how it works," which suggests skepticism about whether Studio can deliver on the promise for their specific use case.

Pattern across 9 accounts: WPIC Marketing Inc. (Asian market coverage), Sift Science Inc., FM Global (global coverage), Intercontinental Hotels Group, Hotwire Communications, Aon, Yapi Kredi (Turkey coverage), Intel Corporation, Safran Electrical and Power (aerospace industry)



Product Complexity & Learning Curve

Across 12 calls, customers expressed concern that Studio felt complex, required significant training, or had a steep learning curve for their teams to become proficient.

Example from Nextiva (https://chorus.ai/meeting/9DC007DF97CC4A27B06ED3AB7250620F): The customer needed repeated clarification on how workbooks function, when credits are consumed, and the distinction between different Studio operations like "run enrichment" versus "refresh." The credit consumption model proved particularly confusing - understanding when AI queries would consume credits, how the complexity scale worked, and how to budget for usage created friction in the buying process. This complexity made it difficult for the customer to confidently explain the product to internal stakeholders or forecast costs accurately.

SECTION 3: OBJECTION HANDLING
See objections detailed in "What's Not Working" section above. Top objections by frequency:

Missing Features (23 calls)
Integration Challenges (14 calls)
User Adoption Concerns (13 calls)
Pricing/ROI Uncertainty (13 calls)
Product Complexity (12 calls)
Data Quality (9 calls)
SECTION 4: PRODUCT FEEDBACK
Theme #1: Native CRM Integrations Beyond Salesforce/HubSpot (14 accounts requested)
What customers want: Customers need Studio to natively integrate with enterprise CRM systems beyond Salesforce and HubSpot, particularly SAP C/4C, Microsoft Dynamics, and custom-built CRMs. They want the same seamless bi-directional sync, automated workflows, and configuration options available for Salesforce.

Specific requests:

Native SAP C/4C integration with bi-directional sync - Pregis Corp., Allied Universal
Improved Salesforce territory assignment logic that handles complex object relationships - NFI Industries (https://chorus.ai/meeting/6CF70D6025FF4821B05E5B62E45A346D), SurveyMonkey (https://chorus.ai/meeting/17CC49300884427B9C04A87C7E09FCED)
Microsoft Dynamics native integration - Motorola Solutions, Wells Fargo, Altice Labs
Custom CRM API support with flexible field mapping - Allied Universal, Altice Labs, Workday, Guidewire
HubSpot integration enhancements for multi-portal setups - WPIC Marketing Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/A2E4EB3E8DE64566ADC5AC2AB403B557), Emburse

Priority: High Rationale: This is actively blocking deals with enterprise customers who have standardized on CRMs other than Salesforce. SAP C/4C alone represents significant enterprise TAM. Without parity across CRM platforms, Studio is limited to Salesforce-first organizations.
Theme #2: Slack Integration for Notifications & Activation (8 accounts requested)
What customers want: Customers want Studio to push notifications, insights, and activation prompts directly into Slack channels where their teams already work. This includes new account alerts, buying signal notifications, and the ability to take action on Studio-generated insights without leaving Slack.

Specific requests:

Push Studio insights and account alerts to Slack channels - Datarobot Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/5DFFDF751AAD41EEABBB5200B2E66074), Island, Box Inc.
Enable sellers to take actions (add to sequence, create tasks) from Slack - Datarobot Inc., TrueContext, Workday
Send weekly digest of high-priority accounts to team channels - IWCO Direct, Affirm, Splunk

Priority: High Rationale: Multiple customers explicitly stated they're pushing workflows into Slack as their central hub. This addresses the adoption objection by meeting sellers where they already work. Datarobot emphasized this as a strategic requirement, stating they want to avoid forcing sellers into yet another tool.
Theme #3: More Granular Technographic & Firmographic Data (11 accounts requested)
What customers want: Customers need more detailed technology adoption data including specific versions, deployment types (cloud vs on-prem), seat counts, and contract renewal dates. They also want specialized firmographic attributes for industry-specific segmentation.

Specific requests:

More detailed technology version and deployment data - Orca Security, NVIDIA, Dynatrace, Intel Corporation
Contract renewal dates and technology spend data - Orca Security, Island, StackAdapt
Franchise/multi-location business identification and hierarchies - Intercontinental Hotels Group, Aflac, NFI Industries
Asian market expansion signals and China-specific data - WPIC Marketing Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/A2E4EB3E8DE64566ADC5AC2AB403B557)
Aerospace & defense industry-specific attributes - Safran Electrical and Power, Northrop Grumman

Priority: High Rationale: This is a competitive vulnerability against specialized data providers. Orca Security was evaluating Clay specifically because of data source flexibility. More granular data would strengthen Studio's position as the "system of record" for go-to-market intelligence.
Theme #4: Advanced Lead Governance & Territory Management (7 accounts requested)
What customers want: Customers need Studio to prevent duplicate outreach, manage complex territory rules, and track lead ownership across distributed sales teams. This includes flagging when prospects are already assigned, respecting territory boundaries, and supporting franchise/agent distribution models.

Specific requests:

Flag when leads are already owned by other team members - Aflac, NFI Industries (https://chorus.ai/meeting/6CF70D6025FF4821B05E5B62E45A346D)
Support for franchise/agent distribution models with territory protection - Aflac, Intercontinental Hotels Group
Complex territory assignment logic beyond simple rules - NFI Industries, SurveyMonkey (https://chorus.ai/meeting/17CC49300884427B9C04A87C7E09FCED)
Lead rotation and round-robin distribution - Island, TransForce

Priority: Medium Rationale: This is critical for specific business models (franchise, agent-based) but not universally applicable. However, Aflac specifically called this their "most significant concern" and it's preventing them from rolling out Studio broadly.
Theme #5: First-Party + Third-Party Data Fusion (9 accounts requested)
What customers want: Customers want Studio to effectively combine their proprietary first-party data (call transcripts, CRM engagement history, product usage data, support tickets) with ZoomInfo's third-party intelligence to generate richer insights and more accurate predictions.

Specific requests:

Analyze call transcripts combined with intent data - Datarobot Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/5DFFDF751AAD41EEABBB5200B2E66074), Island, Instacart
Incorporate product usage data for customer health scoring - Sift Science Inc., Twilio Inc.
Overlay support ticket data to identify at-risk accounts - Splunk, Box Inc.
Combine CRM opportunity history with lookalike modeling - IWCO Direct, Affirm

Priority: Medium Rationale: This addresses the objection that Studio doesn't leverage customers' unique data assets. Several accounts compared this unfavorably to internal builds or Clay workflows that excel at custom data fusion.
