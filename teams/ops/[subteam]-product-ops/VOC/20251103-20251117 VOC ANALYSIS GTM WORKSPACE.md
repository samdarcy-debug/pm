SECTION 1: WHAT WE LEARNED
✅ WHAT'S RESONATING
AI-Powered Account Prioritization Eliminating Manual Analysis

The ability to remove critical thinking burden from sellers by delivering pre-packaged, actionable recommendations resonated across multiple accounts. Customers consistently praised the shift from "here's all the data, you figure it out" to "here's what to do next and why."

Example from Twilio (https://chorus.ai/meeting/B29F7309EF34478FA97E9DED6A03ADF3): "Save them time and just tell them where to focus... as much as you can save time that you can just bring in more more Revenue... furniture pre-assembled."

Also seen with: OUTFRONT Media, In-Telecom Consulting LLC, Perficient, Remote Technology Services Inc., Netstock, Citizens Financial Group, Westlake Chemical

Unified Intelligence Layer Consolidating Fragmented Data Sources

The concept of synthesizing multiple data sources (Gong, Salesforce, intent signals, ZoomInfo, product usage) into a single actionable workspace strongly resonated with RevOps leaders drowning in tool sprawl.

Example from GE Vernova (https://chorus.ai/meeting/A8241C511C3546958BD90C2C716480F4): "I like what I saw... single pane of glass... eliminate juggling too many platforms and consolidating intent data, website visits, CRM, marketing automation, and engagement signals into one system."

Also seen with: Twilio, Omilia, Salary.com, Park Place Technologies (Curvature LLC), Triumph Environmental

AI-Generated Personalized Outreach and Talk Tracks

Automated generation of personalized emails, displacement strategies, and account-specific talking points caught customers' attention, especially when shown alongside prioritized account lists.

Example from Remote Technology Services Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/23269763CCA64CB5930BB4970E29C038): "The AI-generated personalized emails caught her attention as a potential solution for creating customized outreach at scale... creating some personalization where you would have had generic emails."

Also seen with: Twilio, Vimeo, HubSpot, OUTFRONT Media, Netstock

Website Visitor Identification and Intent Signal Capture

The ability to identify companies (and in some cases individuals) visiting websites and trigger automated alerts resonated particularly with companies lacking robust inbound lead capture.

Example from In-Telecom Consulting LLC (https://chorus.ai/meeting/FEC75BBC26EC462BB4DF1A4128511545): "This is exactly why I want all these... if it doesn't tell me the person's name, it tells me the company... I love it. This is essentially what?"

Also seen with: Umano Medical, DomainTools, TaskUs, Arrive Logistics, NetAlly

Seamless Integration with Existing Sales Engagement Tools (Outreach/Salesloft)

The ability to push prioritized accounts and AI-generated content directly into sellers' existing workflows (Outreach, Salesloft) addressed adoption concerns about adding "yet another tool."

Example from Twilio (https://chorus.ai/meeting/B29F7309EF34478FA97E9DED6A03ADF3): "Would somebody hypothetically be able to plug that right into like an Outreach...and then that also could be used somehow to actually track that. Hey, this seller action on this account."

Also seen with: Salary.com, Park Place Technologies, Spekit, SundaySky

GTM Studio + Workspace Connection for Marketing-Led Distribution

The ability for marketing/RevOps to build sophisticated audiences in Studio and push them to sales via Workspace solved a critical "how do we operationalize insights" gap.

Example from Salary.com (https://chorus.ai/meeting/663213F93560431991D8CC04180016E3): "That was during the beta that was one of the things that we noticed that was missing. Okay, we're making all this stuff in GTM studio. How do we get it to anybody?"

Also seen with: GE Vernova, Perficient, Ziegler Caterpillar, OUTFRONT Media
❌ WHAT'S NOT WORKING
Workflow Disruption - Adding Another Platform to Already Crowded Tech Stacks

Customers repeatedly expressed concern about forcing reps to leave familiar environments (Salesforce, Outreach) to access Workspace, creating adoption barriers.

Example from Salary.com (https://chorus.ai/meeting/663213F93560431991D8CC04180016E3): "Reps live in Salesforce for all of their activity and Outreach, just because it's easier and we've got the automation running in there... we don't want to make more work for them."

Pattern across 12 accounts: March Networks Corporate, Umano Medical, Flexport, Omilia, New York Giants, Citizens Financial Group, iVision, Live Nation, SundaySky, TaskUs, Roth Staffing, Arrive Logistics

Perceived Feature Overlap with Recently Renewed Tools

Customers who had just renewed ZoomInfo Copilot or other AI assistants expressed confusion and frustration about being pitched what appeared to be overlapping functionality.

Example from March Networks Corporate (https://chorus.ai/meeting/D2C749C7CFCF47C190EBA601C3E62F3C): "We just re upped on Copilot and then we're hearing oh, well, but Copilot doesn't have all these data sources... this information is already on the company page... I don't really understand why I need to see it in a spreadsheet view."

Pattern across 8 accounts: March Networks Corporate, Venturis Capital Corp., DomainTools, Park Place Technologies, Udemy, Citizens Financial Group (multiple calls), Blueshift

AI-Generated Content Feels Generic and Detectable

Several customers pushed back on AI-generated outreach, stating it feels inauthentic, overly generic, and recipients can immediately identify automated content.

Example from Umano Medical (https://chorus.ai/meeting/E09410464D2A414AA29CCA01D147A5ED): "I receive maybe 5 emails a day that might come from ZoomInfo that I don't even open because I know it's generated. I see it from the first sentence... right now it's just like, no, you're lazy."

Pattern across 6 accounts: Umano Medical, OUTFRONT Media, Vimeo, Omilia, Live Nation, Citizens Financial Group

Missing Navigation Back to Familiar ZoomInfo/Salesforce Views

Customers wanted easy pathways to jump from Workspace back to standard ZoomInfo company pages or Salesforce records where they conduct actual selling activities.

Example from Salary.com (https://chorus.ai/meeting/663213F93560431991D8CC04180016E3): "It would be super slick if that company name was the hot link back to the regular ZoomInfo, that would be ideal... a sales rep can just they can look at the data in the row and they're like, oh, okay. And then just click on it and go about their normal day."

Pattern across 7 accounts: Salary.com, Flexport, TaskUs, Omilia, SundaySky, Live Nation, Remote Technology Services Inc.

Limited Access to Salesforce Custom Objects Containing Critical Business Data

Customers storing important customer interaction data in Salesforce custom objects (complaints, projects, product usage) found the AI's intelligence incomplete without this context.

Example from Westlake Chemical (https://chorus.ai/meeting/F364633678CA4DA1AD6C77133DF68A19): "You guys currently don't have access to Salesforce, custom objects. So you only have access to standard objects. So there's a gap... critical business data lives in custom objects."

Pattern across 4 accounts: Westlake Chemical, GE Vernova, Flexport, Park Place Technologies

Unclear Differentiation Between Studio, Workspace, Copilot, and Agents

Customers consistently confused which product does what, particularly the distinctions between Workspace and Copilot, leading to positioning challenges.

Example from DomainTools (https://chorus.ai/meeting/F58850877FC346E98A5FB0E53B47C1E5): "Is Go-to-Market Workspace embedded within the Co Pilot? I didn't know if there was there separation or distinction between like this feels like where the agents might have gone."

Pattern across 9 accounts: DomainTools, GE Vernova, March Networks Corporate, Umano Medical, Ziegler Caterpillar, Omilia, Citizens Financial Group, Live Nation, Blueshift

Credit/Cost Anxiety Without Visibility Into What's Already Enriched

Customers with limited credits expressed frustration about inability to see which records are already enriched, risking wasted credits on duplicate enrichment.

Example from Remote Technology Services Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/23269763CCA64CB5930BB4970E29C038): "I don't have any credits right now... I don't even know how to action on that... how to identify records already under credit management."

Pattern across 5 accounts: Remote Technology Services Inc., Umano Medical, Venturis Capital Corp., TaskUs, Live Nation

"Does it support our compliance requirements around AI usage?" - Ziegler Caterpillar (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C7949D4BE10244018F4AF8F98E24B550)
SECTION 3: OBJECTION HANDLING
Objection Theme #1: Change Management & Adoption Risk (Raised in 15 calls)
What customers said:

"Reps live in Salesforce for all of their activity and Outreach... we don't want to make more work for them. We want to make it easy for them to get back to the normal view." - Salary.com (https://chorus.ai/meeting/663213F93560431991D8CC04180016E3)
"We have no proof that the sellers that we assigned seats to are actively using this... that's the concern is adoption." - Umano Medical (https://chorus.ai/meeting/E09410464D2A414AA29CCA01D147A5ED)
"We looked at RingLead the first time, we're like awesome...and then we started working with it and we're like wait this has got a huge learning curve... And I don't feel like we're fully optimizing that. And so we're hesitant." - Park Place Technologies (https://chorus.ai/meeting/CC523B4CA9694497B5AACD5757A31047)

Pattern: Customers are drowning in underutilized tools and fear adding another platform that reps won't adopt, especially if it requires leaving familiar workflows. The "yet another tool" objection is particularly strong among companies with recent unsuccessful implementations.
Objection Theme #2: Unclear Value vs. Existing ZoomInfo Products (Raised in 12 calls)
What customers said:

"We just re upped on Copilot and then we're hearing oh, well, but Copilot doesn't have all these data sources... this information is already on the company page... I don't really understand why I need to see it in a spreadsheet view." - March Networks Corporate (https://chorus.ai/meeting/D2C749C7CFCF47C190EBA601C3E62F3C)
"Is this a replacement for Copilot or complementary? I'm confused about the overlap." - Citizens Financial Group
"You're asking me to pay more when I just renewed and haven't seen ROI yet." - Venturis Capital Corp. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C4B0ED16666544439F703606EAFB227D)

Pattern: Customers who recently renewed Copilot or other ZoomInfo products feel blindsided by new offerings that seem duplicative. They struggle to understand the differentiation and feel they're being upsold before proving value from existing investments.
Objection Theme #3: AI-Generated Content Quality Concerns (Raised in 8 calls)
What customers said:

"I receive maybe 5 emails a day that might come from ZoomInfo that I don't even open because I know it's generated. I see it from the first sentence... right now it's just like, no, you're lazy." - Umano Medical (https://chorus.ai/meeting/E09410464D2A414AA29CCA01D147A5ED)
"I find it very cold outreach versus leveraging the insights we have in our CRM to understand product usage, recent touch points, etc." - Vimeo (https://chorus.ai/meeting/39B543D42428427AB68E560312E43F43)
"They need to customize it with their own tone and voice... they need to kind of unpack that a little bit and do some work behind it." - OUTFRONT Media (https://chorus.ai/meeting/2F13248727A7408CB8B7E1E677D912E7)

Pattern: Sophisticated buyers immediately recognize AI-generated content and view it as lazy. For existing customer outreach (not cold prospecting), the AI fails to incorporate relationship history and product usage data, making recommendations feel tone-deaf.
Objection Theme #4: Budget Constraints & ROI Uncertainty (Raised in 11 calls)
What customers said:

"If we start assigning to those 2 people creates an expectation of, okay we need that, but then until we get some ROI... it's like chicken and the egg thing." - Umano Medical (https://chorus.ai/meeting/E09410464D2A414AA29CCA01D147A5ED)
"I don't have any credits right now... we've been using Clay as a workaround to continue enrichment operations." - Remote Technology Services Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/23269763CCA64CB5930BB4970E29C038)
"Salesforce charges you for every query when pulling data from external systems... that could create unpredictable and potentially expensive usage patterns." - Westlake Chemical (https://chorus.ai/meeting/F364633678CA4DA1AD6C77133DF68A19)

Pattern: Companies with constrained budgets or recent underperformance with ZoomInfo resist additional investment without clear ROI proof. Credit management concerns compound this, as customers can't track which data they've already paid to enrich.
Objection Theme #5: Enterprise Security & Compliance Restrictions (Raised in 4 calls)
What customers said:

"I've had a member on my team who got his... he had the app downloaded on his personal phone which he has his work email on. So like you can't do that... our cybersecurity policy restricts AI usage exclusively to Microsoft Copilot." - Ziegler Caterpillar (https://chorus.ai/meeting/C7949D4BE10244018F4AF8F98E24B550)
"I would definitely have to check from a security standpoint... anything that has AI puts like a red flag up for me." - Citizens Financial Group
"We could show up on your site and be like, oh, yeah, that's Killen... but that would put you in a compliance issue for PII." - GE Vernova (https://chorus.ai/meeting/A8241C511C3546958BD90C2C716480F4)

Pattern: Enterprise customers with strict security policies have locked AI usage to approved platforms (typically Microsoft Copilot). ZoomInfo's AI features trigger compliance reviews, creating adoption barriers even when there's product-market fit.
Objection Theme #6: Mismatch for High-Velocity Transactional Sales Teams (Raised in 6 calls)
What customers said:

"Our global AES would contact 10 people at all 10 accounts they wouldn't necessarily be prioritizing they would continue with their high velocity transactional Outreach." - Salary.com (https://chorus.ai/meeting/663213F93560431991D8CC04180016E3)
"This works for strategic enterprise AEs but not for our transactional team that needs to hit volume metrics." - Citizens Financial Group
"SDRs don't own accounts but are associated via a custom field tied to the AE owner... how would the system show accounts on first login?" - Remote Technology Services Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/23269763CCA64CB5930BB4970E29C038)

Pattern: Workspace's strategic account prioritization approach doesn't fit high-volume, transactional sales motions where reps need to blast through dozens of accounts daily. The tool assumes account ownership models that don't exist in all sales org structures.
SECTION 4: PRODUCT FEEDBACK
Theme #1: Seamless Navigation Between Workspace and Standard Views (18 accounts requested)
What customers want: The ability to easily jump from Workspace account lists back to standard ZoomInfo company pages or Salesforce records where reps conduct actual selling activities, without losing context or having to search manually.

Specific requests:

Hyperlinked company names that click through to full ZoomInfo profiles - Salary.com (https://chorus.ai/meeting/663213F93560431991D8CC04180016E3), Flexport, TaskUs, Omilia
Integration with Salesforce that maintains bidirectional sync of notes and activities - Salary.com, Flexport, SundaySky, Live Nation
Ability to open accounts in side panel without leaving Workspace view - Remote Technology Services Inc., Citizens Financial Group

Priority: High Rationale: This is blocking adoption. Reps won't use a tool that creates friction in their daily workflow. Customers explicitly stated this would make the platform "super slick" and increase usage.
Theme #2: Access to Salesforce Custom Objects for Complete Intelligence (6 accounts requested)
What customers want: AI-powered insights that incorporate data from Salesforce custom objects where critical business information lives (product usage, support tickets, projects, customer complaints, renewal dates, etc.) beyond standard account/opportunity/contact objects.

Specific requests:

Read access to custom objects containing product usage, complaints, and projects data - Westlake Chemical (https://chorus.ai/meeting/F364633678CA4DA1AD6C77133DF68A19), GE Vernova
Ability to surface insights from custom relationship structures and buying committees - Flexport, Park Place Technologies
Incorporate renewal and support ticket data into prioritization logic - Citizens Financial Group, SundaySky

Priority: High Rationale: For existing customer expansion plays, the AI's recommendations feel incomplete without understanding product adoption, support interactions, and renewal cycles. This limits Workspace to new logo hunting rather than comprehensive account management.
Theme #3: Credit Visibility and Smart Enrichment Management (7 accounts requested)
What customers want: Transparent visibility into which contacts/accounts are already enriched under credit management, with intelligent recommendations to leverage existing data before triggering new enrichment.

Specific requests:

In-app indicator showing which records are under active credit management - Remote Technology Services Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/23269763CCA64CB5930BB4970E29C038), Umano Medical, TaskUs
Proactive warnings before triggering enrichment on already-enriched records - Remote Technology Services Inc., Live Nation
Reporting dashboard showing credit consumption trends and efficiency metrics - Venturis Capital Corp., Citizens Financial Group

Priority: Medium Rationale: Budget-constrained customers need this for responsible credit management, but workarounds exist (export reports). However, poor credit UX creates friction that dampens adoption among cost-conscious users.
Theme #4: Enhanced AI Personalization with CRM Context (9 accounts requested)
What customers want: AI-generated outreach that incorporates relationship history, past touchpoints, product usage patterns, and recent CRM activities rather than treating every email like a cold outreach.

Specific requests:

Emails that reference specific past meetings, proposals, or conversations from CRM - Vimeo (https://chorus.ai/meeting/39B543D42428427AB68E560312E43F43), OUTFRONT Media
Product usage data integration to inform expansion plays for existing customers - Vimeo, Citizens Financial Group, Live Nation
Ability to train AI on company-specific messaging and successful email patterns - Omilia, SundaySky, Flexport

Priority: High Rationale: Current AI content works for cold outbound but fails for account management teams working existing customers. Customers explicitly stated they "don't like it" for this use case, limiting product applicability to only new logo teams.
Theme #5: Direct Salesloft/Outreach Integration with Tracking (8 accounts requested)
What customers want: Native integration to push prioritized accounts and AI-generated sequences directly into Salesloft/Outreach with full tracking of whether reps actually acted on recommendations.

Specific requests:

One-click push of Workspace audiences into Outreach cadences - Twilio (https://chorus.ai/meeting/B29F7309EF34478FA97E9DED6A03ADF3), Spekit, TaskUs
Tracking dashboard showing which recommendations led to rep activities - Twilio, Netstock, Citizens Financial Group
Preserve template tracking when sellers customize AI-generated content - OUTFRONT Media (https://chorus.ai/meeting/2F13248727A7408CB8B7E1E677D912E7), SundaySky

Priority: High Rationale: Customers stated this integration is "on the product development roadmap" but its absence creates workflow friction. The tracking component is essential for proving ROI and justifying continued investment.
Theme #6: Configurable User Assignment & Account Access Controls (5 accounts requested)
What customers want: Flexible deployment options allowing admins to control which users see which accounts in Workspace based on territory, role, segment, or custom Salesforce fields rather than account-wide deployment.

Specific requests:

Support for SDRs without direct account ownership but tied via custom fields - Remote Technology Services Inc. (https://chorus.ai/meeting/23269763CCA64CB5930BB4970E29C038), TaskUs
Territory-based filtering so reps only see accounts in their patch - Citizens Financial Group, Live Nation
Segment-specific deployment (enterprise vs. transactional teams) - Salary.com, Citizens Financial Group

Priority: Medium Rationale: Nice-to-have for complex sales org structures. Workarounds exist (Studio audiences with filtering), but lack of granular control limits use cases and increases noise for sellers seeing irrelevant accounts.
