## SECTION 1: WHAT WE LEARNED

### ✅ WHAT'S RESONATING

#### 🔹 BASELINE RESONANCE PATTERNS

**These themes have persisted across multiple reporting periods and are tracked consistently.**

##### AI-Powered Intelligence & Natural Language Query Capabilities

**Trend:** ↓ Decreasing **This Period:** Raised in 17 of 94 calls (18%) **Last Period:** 28 of 83 calls (34%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Significant decrease from previous period's strong resonance

The ability to use natural language prompts to analyze data and generate insights continues to resonate but at reduced frequency. Customers appreciate that Studio's AI can process complex queries without requiring technical SQL knowledge or manual analysis. The AI agent functionality for generating account plans, persona-specific messaging, and buying committee identification generates enthusiasm among technically sophisticated customers. The decrease from 34% to 18% may reflect demonstration approaches focusing more on orchestration workflow than AI query capabilities.

**Example from Curitec** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/D1E6250470C7437E819634D0B25DE871](https://chorus.ai/meeting/D1E6250470C7437E819634D0B25DE871)): The AI-powered natural language query capability strongly resonated with Andrew, who immediately recognized how it could replace their current manual process of pulling data through complex queries. He expressed clear excitement about the ability to ask questions conversationally rather than building reports, stating this would dramatically reduce the technical burden on his team.

##### Data Aggregation & Unified Workspace Concept

**Trend:** ↑ Increasing **This Period:** Raised in 24 of 94 calls (26%) **Last Period:** 15 of 83 calls (18%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Slight increase from 18% to 26% but below Nov 3-17 baseline

The "single pane of glass" positioning and ability to consolidate data from multiple sources (ZoomInfo, Salesforce, Snowflake, intent signals, technographics) into unified workbooks continues to resonate. Customers value eliminating the need to toggle between multiple tools and spreadsheets. This period showed modest improvement over Nov 18-Dec 1 (26% vs 18%) but remains below the strong 35%+ resonance seen in Nov 3-17 period.

**Example from Merkle** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/A47AC8C439E24381AE0B3293D68046C1](https://chorus.ai/meeting/A47AC8C439E24381AE0B3293D68046C1)): The centralized data aggregation concept resonated with Merkle's team who are currently managing multiple point solutions across their tech stack. They expressed strong interest in consolidating their disparate data sources into unified workbooks where they could orchestrate campaigns and distribute curated lists to sellers without manual handoffs.

**Also seen with:** Citizens Financial Group, Dynata, Infor, QXO, Monday.com, CaptivateIQ, World Wide Technology, Keeper, Softchoice, G2, Fluke Reliability, JotForm, Brex, Alation Inc., BDO USA, Taylor Corp., Outfront Media, SIB Fixed Cost Reduction, Illumio, HubSpot, AssetWatch, Hanson Wade, Flashpoint

##### Orchestration & Workflow Automation

**Trend:** → Stable  
**This Period:** Raised in 25 of 94 calls (27%) **Last Period:** 19 of 83 calls (23%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Consistent stable resonance across all periods

The ability to build audiences in Studio and push them to sellers or activate sequences continues to resonate. Operations teams value the capability to orchestrate plays and distribute curated lists without requiring manual handoffs. The slight increase from 23% to 27% indicates this remains a core value driver for RevOps/Operations personas.

**Example from Dynata** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/59BE9D0D6A7645EFA6717D3F24B679A4](https://chorus.ai/meeting/59BE9D0D6A7645EFA6717D3F24B679A4)): The workflow orchestration capabilities strongly resonated with Dynata's operations team who currently struggle with manual list distribution processes. They expressed enthusiasm about the ability to build sophisticated audiences in Studio and automatically push them to sellers with contextual guidance, eliminating their current process of emailing CSV files to individual reps.

##### Multi-Source Data Integration

**Trend:** ↑ Increasing **This Period:** Raised in 40 of 94 calls (43%) **Last Period:** 15 of 83 calls (18%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Dramatic increase from 18% to 43% \- strongest growth this period

The ability to pull data from Salesforce, Snowflake, ZoomInfo, intent providers, and other sources into a single workbook resonates strongly. Customers value avoiding vendor lock-in and leveraging existing data investments. The 2.4x increase from last period (18% to 43%) represents the most significant shift in any baseline category and indicates this is becoming the primary differentiation point for Studio.

**Example from Frost Bank** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/36D180A62412423FB66D2F9128DFDAF1](https://chorus.ai/meeting/36D180A62412423FB66D2F9128DFDAF1)): The multi-source data integration capability addressed Frost Bank's core challenge of data fragmentation. Aaron and Ashley repeatedly emphasized their struggle with disparate systems and the need to unify data from Salesforce, their proprietary underwriting systems, and ZoomInfo into a single operational layer. The ability to bring together these sources without complex ETL processes resonated as a major efficiency unlock.

**Also seen with:** Citizens Financial Group, ContractPodAi, Verkada, Dynata, Infor, Ibisworld, Netwrix Corp., QXO, Monday.com, Cribl.io, FM Systems, DigiCert, Cvent, Recite Me, Deposco, Malnove Inc., Softchoice, G2, Pandora Media, Ltimindtree Ltd., Mitek Systems, JotForm, Lyft Inc., MongoDB, Abridge, Vision Service Plan, The Hilb Group, Hylant Group, Otava, Brex, Alation Inc., BDO USA, Outfront Media, QuickBase, Illumio, R.R. Donnelley, PlainID, HubSpot, AssetWatch, AAPC

##### Time Savings & Efficiency at Scale

**Trend:** → Stable **This Period:** Raised in 25 of 94 calls (27%) **Last Period:** 21 of 83 calls (25%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Consistent resonance around 25-27% across periods

The ability to automate previously manual processes and operate at scale continues to resonate. Customers value eliminating repetitive research tasks and reducing time spent on data preparation. This remains a steady mid-tier resonance theme across all reporting periods.

**Example from Citizens Financial Group** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/415396905C7A42639F20533A2F05C2EC](https://chorus.ai/meeting/415396905C7A42639F20533A2F05C2EC)): The time savings and scale efficiency messaging landed strongly with Citizens Financial's operations team who are currently drowning in manual data preparation work. They expressed frustration with their current process requiring hours of manual work to prepare target lists, and the ability to automate this at scale was the primary value proposition that resonated.

**Also seen with:** Frost Bank, Dynata, Infor, Preveil LLC, Ibisworld, QXO, Monday.com, CaptivateIQ, Recite Me, Deposco, Keeper, Fluke Reliability, Compass Group Canada, JotForm, Abridge, The Hilb Group, Cielo Talent, Skillable, Alation Inc., BDO USA, Outfront Media, QuickBase, Seismic, The Pipeline Group, HubSpot

##### Data Enrichment Capabilities

**Trend:** ↓ Decreasing significantly **This Period:** Raised in 7 of 94 calls (7%) **Last Period:** 14 of 83 calls (17%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Major decrease from 17% to 7%

The ability to enrich existing CRM records with ZoomInfo data and append missing fields continues to resonate but at significantly reduced frequency. Customers value filling gaps in their contact and company data without manual research. The dramatic decrease (17% to 7%) suggests either: (1) enrichment has become table stakes and is no longer a differentiator, (2) demonstrations are focusing on more sophisticated capabilities, or (3) customers already have enrichment solutions in place.

**Example from CaptivateIQ** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/2FAE27C551D745D997176936CAEF70EC](https://chorus.ai/meeting/2FAE27C551D745D997176936CAEF70EC)): The data enrichment capabilities addressed CaptivateIQ's specific need to fill gaps in their Salesforce contact data. They currently have incomplete records and manually research missing information, so the ability to automatically enrich at scale with ZoomInfo data resonated as a clear operational improvement.

**Also seen with:** Fluke Reliability, Abridge, The Hilb Group, Flashpoint, Azira, Televerde

#### 🔸 NEW RESONANCE PATTERNS THIS PERIOD

**Genuinely new themes that emerged. If these persist next period, will be promoted to baseline.**

**Conversation Intelligence Integration for Semantic Analysis**

**Raised in:** 47 accounts (50% of calls)

The ability to integrate with conversation intelligence platforms (Gong, Chorus) and perform semantic analysis of call transcripts to extract competitive mentions, pain points, and buying signals generated exceptionally strong interest. This theme appeared in feature requests from 50% of accounts, suggesting it's moving from "nice-to-have" to "must-have" capability.

**Example from Cribl.io** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/602AD05CD5AD45FDA000ED3F1E3CCC97](https://chorus.ai/meeting/602AD05CD5AD45FDA000ED3F1E3CCC97)): Customer expressed strong interest in pulling call transcript data from Gong into Studio workbooks to analyze patterns across customer conversations. They want to identify which competitors are being mentioned, what objections are surfacing, and which messaging resonates \- all at scale rather than manually reviewing calls.

**Also seen with:** QuickBase, Outfront Media, G2, R.R. Donnelley, University of Phoenix, Deposco, Keeper, Bigge Group Inc., PlainID, and 38 more accounts

### ❌ WHAT'S NOT WORKING

#### 🔹 BASELINE FRICTION PATTERNS

**These issues have persisted across multiple reporting periods and are tracked consistently.**

##### Missing Features & Product Gaps

**Trend:** ↑ Increasing **This Period:** Raised in 30 of 94 calls (32%) **Last Period:** 23 of 83 calls (28%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Slight increase from 28% to 32%

Customers identify specific capabilities they expected or needed that Studio doesn't currently offer. These gaps range from missing integrations to workflow features to data types. The increase from 28% to 32% suggests product-market fit challenges are growing rather than shrinking as Studio matures.

**Example from Merkle** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/A47AC8C439E24381AE0B3293D68046C1](https://chorus.ai/meeting/A47AC8C439E24381AE0B3293D68046C1)): Merkle identified critical gaps in Studio's current capabilities including lack of native HubSpot integration (they're a HubSpot shop, not Salesforce), inability to customize AI prompts for their specific industry vertical, and missing support for their preferred data warehouse solution. These weren't edge cases but core requirements for their evaluation.

**Pattern across 30 accounts:** Missing integrations (HubSpot, specific CRMs, data warehouses), lack of industry-specific templates, insufficient technographic granularity, limited custom field support, missing API endpoints, incomplete reporting capabilities

##### Integration Complexity & CRM Compatibility

**Trend:** ↑ Increasing **This Period:** Raised in 34 of 94 calls (36%) **Last Period:** 14 of 83 calls (17%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Dramatic increase from 17% to 36% \- concerning trend

Integration challenges surfaced in over one-third of calls. Customers express concern about connecting Studio to their existing tech stack or encounter limitations with their specific CRM platform. The 2.1x increase from last period (17% to 36%) is the most concerning negative trend and suggests integration friction is becoming the primary deal blocker.

**Example from Frost Bank** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/36D180A62412423FB66D2F9128DFDAF1](https://chorus.ai/meeting/36D180A62412423FB66D2F9128DFDAF1)): Frost Bank's complex Salesforce setup with custom objects, territory rules, and proprietary underwriting data integration created significant concerns about implementation timeline and technical lift. While they saw clear value, the integration complexity became a major discussion point that consumed significant meeting time and energy.

**Pattern across 34 accounts:** Salesforce custom object limitations, territory assignment complexity, HubSpot compatibility gaps, data warehouse sync issues, API rate limits, bidirectional sync concerns, field mapping challenges

##### User Adoption & Daily Workflow Concerns

**Trend:** → Stable  
**This Period:** Raised in 31 of 94 calls (33%) **Last Period:** 13 of 83 calls (16%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Dramatic increase from 16% to 33%

Customers express skepticism about whether sellers would actually use Studio or whether it would become "shelfware." Concerns center on whether the tool would fit into existing daily workflows. The 2.1x increase (16% to 33%) indicates this objection is intensifying rather than being resolved through better positioning or demonstration techniques.

**Example from Verkada** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/26FD4E6FF9EB4815B0DAB8820E3F6985](https://chorus.ai/meeting/26FD4E6FF9EB4815B0DAB8820E3F6985)): Verkada's Mallory questioned whether reps would actually log into Studio daily given they already work across Outreach, Tien, and direct email. She stated that adding another platform \- even one with clear value \- creates adoption risk if it's not seamlessly embedded in their current workflow. The "will sellers actually use this?" question dominated the objection discussion.

**Pattern across 31 accounts:** RevOps persona understands value but questions whether sellers will adopt, concerns about training burden, fear of tool becoming shelfware, need for seamless workflow integration, requires executive mandate for adoption

##### Pricing Concerns & Budget Constraints

**Trend:** ↑ Increasing **This Period:** Raised in 27 of 94 calls (29%) **Last Period:** 13 of 83 calls (16%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Major increase from 16% to 29%

Pricing emerged as an objection or concern in nearly one-third of calls. Customers express uncertainty about cost, question ROI, or indicate budget timing constraints. The 1.8x increase (16% to 29%) suggests pricing/ROI justification is becoming more challenging, possibly due to economic headwinds or increased scrutiny of new tool purchases.

**Example from DigiCert** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/6DDEB371701641D39588CD5D1727707E](https://chorus.ai/meeting/6DDEB371701641D39588CD5D1727707E)): DigiCert raised pricing concerns early in the conversation, questioning whether the $30-50K investment could be justified given their current ZoomInfo spend and recent budget cuts. They needed clear ROI metrics and case studies showing quantifiable efficiency gains before they could move forward with evaluation.

**Pattern across 27 accounts:** $30-50K price point creates sticker shock, need to prove ROI before committing, budget already allocated elsewhere, year-end timing makes new purchases difficult, need to sunset other tools to free up budget

##### Data Quality & Accuracy Concerns

**Trend:** → Stable (low frequency) **This Period:** Raised in 4 of 94 calls (4%) **Last Period:** 9 of 83 calls (11%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Decreased from 11% to 4% \- positive trend

Customers question the quality, accuracy, or currency of ZoomInfo's data, particularly for specialized industries or international markets. The significant decrease (11% to 4%) is encouraging and suggests either improved data quality messaging or different customer segments in pipeline.

**Example from Coretelligent** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/E7CF1F08E1F84410802FE11D507CBDB9](https://chorus.ai/meeting/E7CF1F08E1F84410802FE11D507CBDB9)): Multiple Coretelligent calls raised concerns about ZoomInfo data accuracy based on past experiences with outdated contact information. They expressed skepticism about investing in Studio if the underlying data quality issues haven't been resolved, stating "the platform is only as good as the data behind it."

**Pattern across 4 accounts:** Past negative experiences with ZoomInfo data accuracy, concerns about international coverage, skepticism about technographic reliability, need for data validation before trusting automated workflows

##### Product Complexity & Learning Curve

**Trend:** → Stable (low frequency) **This Period:** Raised in 7 of 94 calls (7%) **Last Period:** 12 of 83 calls (14%) \- Nov 18-Dec 1 report **Historical Context:** Improved from 14% to 7%

Customers express concern that Studio feels complex, requires significant training, or has a steep learning curve for their teams to become proficient. The improvement from 14% to 7% suggests demonstrations are becoming clearer or product UX has improved.

**Example from Frost Bank** ([https://chorus.ai/meeting/36D180A62412423FB66D2F9128DFDAF1](https://chorus.ai/meeting/36D180A62412423FB66D2F9128DFDAF1)): Frost Bank expressed concerns about the learning curve required for their producers (70-75 people) to become proficient with Studio. With limited technical resources and producers focused on selling, they questioned whether the training investment would be justified and how long it would take before they saw productivity gains.

**Pattern across 7 accounts:** Concerns about training time required, complexity feels overwhelming, need simplified workflows for non-technical users, worry about support burden during ramp

#### 🔸 NEW FRICTION PATTERNS THIS PERIOD

**New objections that emerged. If these persist next period, will be promoted to baseline.**

**Clay Competitive Pressure \- "We're Already Building This in Clay"**

**Raised in:** 48 calls (51% of calls)

Over half of all calls included explicit competitive positioning questions about Clay, with many customers stating they're already building similar workflows in Clay or evaluating it as an alternative. This represents the strongest competitive threat observed across any reporting period. Customers frequently describe Clay as more flexible, affordable, and easier to customize despite ZoomInfo's data advantages.

**What customers said:**

- "We're already doing something similar in Clay and it's working well for our use case" \- multiple accounts expressed this sentiment  
- "Clay gives us more flexibility to connect any data source we want" \- competitive positioning theme  
- "The price point of Clay is much more attractive for our team size" \- pricing pressure

**Pattern:** Clay is the default comparison point for Studio evaluations. Customers see Clay as the benchmark for data orchestration and workflow automation, putting Studio in defensive positioning rather than offensive differentiation. The frequency (51% of calls) indicates this is the \#1 competitive threat and requires immediate strategic response.

**Accounts raising Clay:** Keeper, Outfront Media, Cribl.io, University of Phoenix, Deposco, PlainID, JotForm, and 41 more accounts

\================================================================================

## SECTION 3: OBJECTION HANDLING

### 🔹 BASELINE OBJECTION PATTERNS

**These objections have persisted across multiple reporting periods and are tracked consistently.**

#### Objection Theme \#1: Integration Complexity (Raised in 34 calls)

**Status:** ↑ Increasing significantly **This period:** Raised in 36% of calls **Context:** Up from 17% last period \- now \#1 objection by frequency

**What customers said:**

- Frost Bank raised extensive concerns about Salesforce custom object integration, territory rules complexity, and the technical lift required to connect their proprietary underwriting systems  
- Coretelligent (multiple calls) questioned API rate limits, field mapping complexity, and whether their specific Salesforce configuration would be supported  
- Netwrix Corp. expressed concern about integration with their Dynamics CRM and data warehouse, stating they've been "burned before" by vendors promising seamless integration

**Pattern:** Integration concerns have exploded from 17% to 36% of calls, making this the most common objection. The pattern shows customers aren't questioning if integration is possible, but rather: (1) how long it will take, (2) what internal resources are required, (3) whether their specific tech stack configuration is supported, and (4) what happens when it breaks. The 2x increase suggests this is becoming the primary deal blocker and requires immediate product/GTM attention.

#### Objection Theme \#2: User Adoption & Workflow Fit (Raised in 31 calls)

**Status:** ↑ Increasing significantly **This period:** Raised in 33% of calls **Context:** Up from 16% last period \- major concern growth

**What customers said:**

- "Will sellers actually use this or will it become shelfware?" \- pattern across Verkada, Preveil LLC, Coretelligent, Netwrix Corp., and 27 more accounts  
- "Our reps barely use the tools they already have, adding another platform seems risky" \- multiple customers expressed this concern  
- "RevOps sees the value but we know getting sellers to adopt new tools is incredibly difficult" \- common theme

**Pattern:** Adoption skepticism doubled from 16% to 33% of calls. The objection consistently comes from RevOps/Ops buyers who understand Studio's value but question whether sellers will actually use it. This is a "buyer-user mismatch" problem where the economic buyer loves the product but doesn't believe the end user will adopt it. The increase suggests demonstrations aren't adequately addressing the "day in the life" seller workflow question.

#### Objection Theme \#3: Missing Features & Product Gaps (Raised in 30 calls)

**Status:** ↑ Increasing **This period:** Raised in 32% of calls **Context:** Up from 28% last period \- product completeness concerns growing

**What customers said:**

- Merkle identified lack of HubSpot integration, missing industry-specific templates, and limited data warehouse options as blockers  
- Multiple customers requested features that "should already be there" for a mature product (conversation intelligence integration, advanced territory management, custom AI prompts)  
- "We expected this to be more complete given the pricing and ZoomInfo's maturity as a company" \- sentiment across multiple calls

**Pattern:** Feature gap concerns increased from 28% to 32%, indicating customers have increasingly sophisticated requirements that Studio doesn't meet. The pattern shows these aren't edge cases but capabilities customers consider table stakes (HubSpot integration, Gong/Chorus integration, advanced CRM features). The increase suggests Studio is being compared against more feature-complete competitors (especially Clay) and losing on functionality breadth.

#### Objection Theme \#4: Pricing & ROI Justification (Raised in 27 calls)

**Status:** ↑ Increasing significantly **This period:** Raised in 29% of calls **Context:** Up from 16% last period \- pricing pressure intensifying

**What customers said:**

- "$30-50K is a significant investment when we're already spending on ZoomInfo platform" \- common pricing concern  
- "We need to see clear ROI metrics before we can justify this to leadership" \- pattern across multiple accounts  
- "Clay is 1/3 the price and seems to do similar things" \- competitive pricing pressure  
- DigiCert, Preveil LLC, FM Systems and others questioned whether they could start with a smaller pilot before committing to full annual contract

**Pattern:** Pricing objections nearly doubled (16% to 29%), with customers consistently citing: (1) high absolute price point ($30-50K), (2) incremental cost on top of existing ZoomInfo spend, (3) unclear ROI without trial period, and (4) competitive pricing pressure from Clay. The increase aligns with economic uncertainty and suggests pricing model or packaging changes may be needed.

#### Objection Theme \#5: Product Complexity & Learning Curve (Raised in 7 calls)

**Status:** ↓ Decreasing **This period:** Raised in 7% of calls **Context:** Down from 14% last period \- demonstrating improvement

**What customers said:**

- Frost Bank, DigiCert, Silverfort expressed concerns about training time required for their teams to become proficient  
- "This looks powerful but also overwhelming \- will our ops team be able to build these workflows?" \- pattern across 7 accounts

**Pattern:** Complexity concerns cut in half (14% to 7%), suggesting either: (1) product UX improvements are working, (2) demonstration techniques are becoming clearer, or (3) different customer segment (more technical buyers). This is the only objection showing positive trend movement.

#### Objection Theme \#6: Data Quality & Accuracy (Raised in 4 calls)

**Status:** ↓ Decreasing **This period:** Raised in 4% of calls **Context:** Down from 11% last period \- continued improvement

**What customers said:**

- Coretelligent (multiple calls) raised concerns based on historical bad experiences with ZoomInfo data quality  
- University of Phoenix, Illumio questioned accuracy for their specific industries

**Pattern:** Data quality concerns decreased from 11% to 4%, continuing positive trend from previous periods. This suggests either improved data quality, better messaging about quality controls, or these concerns are being addressed earlier in sales cycle before demo stage.

### 🔸 NEW OBJECTION PATTERNS THIS PERIOD

**Clay Competitive Threat \- "Why Not Just Use Clay?"**

**Raised in:** 48 calls (51%)

**What customers said:**

- "We're already building similar workflows in Clay and it's working for us"  
- "Clay is more flexible and affordable for our team size"  
- "Clay lets us connect any data source \- why would we be locked into ZoomInfo's ecosystem?"  
- "Our RevOps team learned Clay in a week, this looks more complex"

**Pattern:** Over half of all calls included Clay competitive positioning questions, making this the dominant competitive threat. The pattern shows Clay isn't just mentioned but actively being evaluated or already in use by prospects. Customers see Clay as: (1) more flexible for custom workflows, (2) significantly cheaper (1/3 the price), (3) easier to learn and deploy, (4) better at connecting diverse data sources. This represents existential competitive threat that requires strategic response, not just sales enablement.

## SECTION 4: PRODUCT FEEDBACK

**This section tracks feature requests and improvement suggestions. Baseline items are tracked for demand trends; new items are flagged as they emerge.**

### 🔹 BASELINE FEATURE REQUESTS

**These requests have appeared across multiple reporting periods.**

#### Theme \#1: Native CRM Integrations Beyond Salesforce/HubSpot

**Status:** ↑ Increasing demand **Requested by:** 23 accounts this period (up from 14 last period)

**What customers want:** Customers need Studio to natively integrate with enterprise CRM systems beyond Salesforce and HubSpot, particularly Microsoft Dynamics, custom-built CRMs, and industry-specific solutions. They want the same seamless bi-directional sync, automated workflows, and configuration options available for Salesforce.

**Specific requests:**

- Microsoft Dynamics native integration with bi-directional sync \- **Merkle**, **ContractPodAi**, **Netwrix Corp.** (2 calls), **Monday.com**, **Intercontinental Hotels Group**, **Malnove Inc.**, **JotForm**, **Oyster HR**, **JAMF Software**, **Ingram Micro**, **Televerde**, **Globalsource Inc.**  
- Custom CRM API support with flexible field mapping \- **Silverfort**, **Mitek Systems**, **Azira**, **The Pipeline Group**, **Akamai Technologies**  
- Industry-specific CRM platforms \- **Intercontinental Hotels Group** (hospitality), **University of Phoenix** (education), **Cielo Talent** (recruiting)  
- Improved Salesforce custom object support beyond standard objects \- **Frost Bank**, **Citizens Financial Group**, **Coretelligent** (multiple calls)

**Priority:** **Critical**

**Rationale:** Request volume increased 64% (14 to 23 accounts). Non-Salesforce shops are effectively blocked from evaluation, and even Salesforce customers with complex configurations face limitations. This is actively preventing deal progression with 24% of pipeline and represents significant TAM limitation. Microsoft Dynamics alone is 45%+ CRM market share that Studio can't effectively address.

#### Theme \#2: Conversation Intelligence Platform Integration (Gong, Chorus, Clari)

**Status:** ↑ Increasing dramatically **Requested by:** 47 accounts this period (NEW as standalone theme \- previously part of "Multi-Source Integration")

**What customers want:** Native connectors to pull call transcript data from Gong, Chorus, and Clari for semantic analysis at scale. Customers want to identify competitive mentions, common objections, successful messaging patterns, and buying signals across their entire call database without manual review.

**Specific requests:**

- Gong integration for semantic analysis of call transcripts \- **QuickBase**, **Outfront Media**, **G2**, **R.R. Donnelley**, **Cribl.io**, and 22 more accounts  
- Chorus integration for competitive intelligence extraction \- **University of Phoenix**, **Deposco**, **Keeper**, **Bigge Group Inc.**, and 8 more accounts  
- Clari integration for pipeline signals \- **PlainID**, **JotForm**, **MongoDB**  
- AI-powered pattern detection across calls (what messages work, what objections surface) \- **Vertex Inc.**, **Lyft Inc.**, **Abridge**, and 9 more accounts

**Priority:** **Critical**

**Rationale:** This exploded from being mentioned as part of data integration to being the \#2 most-requested feature (50% of accounts). Customers see call intelligence as the "missing piece" that would differentiate Studio from Clay and other competitors. The dramatic emergence (not tracked separately in previous periods) indicates market expectations have shifted \- this is now table stakes for sophisticated GTM operations. Should be elevated to highest product priority.

#### Theme \#3: Sales Engagement Platform Integration (Outreach, Salesloft)

**Status:** → Stable **Requested by:** 15 accounts this period

**What customers want:** Direct, bi-directional integration with Outreach and Salesloft that allows audiences to flow seamlessly from Studio into cadences without manual CSV export/import, and activity data to flow back for reporting.

**Specific requests:**

- Push audiences directly into Outreach cadences with field mapping \- **QuickBase**, **Quorum Analytics**, **Alation Inc.**, **Hylant Group**  
- Pull Outreach/Salesloft activity data back into Studio for engagement tracking \- **Pandora Media**, **Cielo Talent**, **Skillable**  
- Maintain talk tracks and personalization from Studio into sequence templates \- **Brex**, **BDO USA**, **Taylor Corp.**

**Priority:** **High**

**Rationale:** Consistent demand (15 accounts) indicates ongoing need, but didn't increase like conversation intelligence integration. Important for workflow completion but customers are more willing to accept manual export/import workaround here versus other integrations. Medium priority relative to CRM and conversation intelligence gaps.

#### Theme \#4: Intent Data Platform Integration (6sense, Demandbase)

**Status:** → Stable **Requested by:** 36 accounts this period

**What customers want:** Native connectors to pull intent signals from 6sense and Demandbase for organizations already invested in these platforms, rather than requiring migration to ZoomInfo's intent data.

**Specific requests:**

- 6sense intent topics and keyword tracking integration \- **Keeper**, **G2**, **R.R. Donnelley**, **PlainID**, **JotForm**, and 11 more accounts  
- Demandbase account engagement scores \- **ContractPodAi**, **Dynata**, **Infor**, **QXO**, and 8 more accounts  
- Preserve existing intent scoring models without re-training \- **Monday.com**, **Cribl.io**, **Cvent**, and 9 more accounts

**Priority:** **Medium**

**Rationale:** Strong demand (36 accounts, 38% of calls) but customers accept this is competitive displacement scenario. Important for enterprise deals where intent platform contracts already exist, but not blocking deals as severely as CRM or conversation intelligence gaps.

#### Theme \#5: Data Warehouse Native Connectivity (Snowflake, Databricks, Azure)

**Status:** ↓ Decreasing (but still mentioned) **Requested by:** 4 accounts this period (down from \~8 last period)

**What customers want:** Direct connectors to query and write to cloud data warehouses without requiring data extraction and loading into Studio.

**Specific requests:**

- Snowflake native connector \- **Global Experience Specialists**, **Televerde**  
- Databricks integration \- **Netwrix Corp.**  
- Azure Synapse support \- **MongoDB**

**Priority:** **Evaluate**

**Rationale:** Request volume decreased, suggesting either: (1) workarounds are acceptable (export/import), (2) Snowflake partnership announcement addressed concerns, or (3) only niche segment needs this. Worth monitoring but not urgent priority given declining mentions.

### 🔸 NEW FEATURE REQUESTS THIS PERIOD

#### Theme: Clay-Style Workflow Builder & Custom Formulas

**Requested by:** 31 accounts

**What customers want:** Visual workflow builder similar to Clay's interface where users can chain together data enrichment, transformation, and action steps using custom formulas and logic. Customers want the ability to build complex, multi-step workflows without requiring CSV exports and re-imports.

**Specific requests:**

- Visual workflow canvas where users can drag-and-drop data transformation steps \- **Keeper**, **Cribl.io**, **Deposco**, **JotForm**, **Lyft Inc.**, and 11 more accounts  
- Custom formula language (similar to Excel or Clay) for data manipulation \- **Vertex Inc.**, **MongoDB**, **Oyster HR**, **Vision Service Plan**, and 8 more accounts  
- Conditional logic and branching (if/then workflows) \- **Silverfort**, **Global Experience Specialists**, **Cielo Talent**, **BDO USA**, and 5 more accounts  
- Ability to chain multiple enrichment providers (not just ZoomInfo) \- **PlainID**, **JotForm**, **Brex**, **Alation Inc.**

**Priority:** **Critical**

**Rationale:** This is the most frequent new request (31 accounts, 33% of calls) and directly responds to Clay competitive threat. Customers explicitly state "Clay lets me do this" when asking for these capabilities. The visual workflow builder represents fundamental UX paradigm that Studio currently lacks. Without this, Studio feels like "just a better UI for ZoomInfo data" rather than a true orchestration platform. Should be highest new feature priority.

#### Theme: Territory & Account Assignment Automation

**Requested by:** 18 accounts

**What customers want:** Automated territory assignment and account routing based on complex rules (geography, company size, industry, existing relationships) that dynamically updates as account characteristics change.

**Specific requests:**

- Rule-based territory assignment with multiple criteria \- **Frost Bank**, **Citizens Financial Group**, **Coretelligent**, **The Hilb Group**, and 6 more accounts  
- Automatic reassignment when accounts grow or change ICP fit \- **Dynata**, **Intercontinental Hotels Group**, **G2**, **Compass Group Canada**, and 4 more accounts  
- Conflict resolution when multiple reps claim same account \- **Verkada**, **Deposco**, **Hylant Group**

**Priority:** **High**

**Rationale:** Emerging as critical need for enterprise sales organizations with complex territory structures (18 accounts). These customers can't fully deploy Studio without solving territory assignment, making it a deployment blocker. However, this is more niche than Clay-style workflows (only affects 19% vs 33% of customers).

#### Theme: Advanced Reporting & Analytics Dashboards

**Requested by:** 22 accounts

**What customers want:** Pre-built and customizable dashboards showing Studio usage, enrichment consumption, workflow performance, and ROI metrics. Customers need to prove value to leadership and optimize their Studio implementation.

**Specific requests:**

- Usage dashboards showing which users/teams actively use Studio \- **Merkle**, **Dynata**, **Preveil LLC**, **Cvent**, **Deposco**, and 7 more accounts  
- Credit consumption analytics to identify waste and optimize spend \- **G2**, **Compass Group Canada**, **Abridge**, **Bigge Group Inc.**, and 5 more accounts  
- Workflow performance metrics (enrichment success rates, API errors, bottlenecks) \- **Brex**, **BDO USA**, **Outfront Media**, **QuickBase**, and 3 more accounts

**Priority:** **High**

**Rationale:** Affects 23% of accounts and directly addresses adoption/ROI objections. Customers can't optimize what they can't measure. This is essential for proving value during renewal conversations and would significantly reduce churn risk.

\================================================================================

## KEY INSIGHTS & STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

**Critical Findings This Period:**

1. **Clay Competitive Threat Has Reached Crisis Level:** 51% of calls mentioned Clay, making it the dominant competitive comparison. This is no longer a niche competitor but the default benchmark customers use to evaluate Studio.  
     
2. **Integration Complexity Is Now Primary Deal Blocker:** Integration concerns doubled from 17% to 36%, overtaking all other objections. The 2x increase in a single reporting period signals systemic problem.  
     
3. **Conversation Intelligence Integration Has Become Table Stakes:** 50% of accounts requested Gong/Chorus integration, emerging as \#2 feature request. Market expectations have shifted \- this is no longer nice-to-have.  
     
4. **Adoption Skepticism Is Intensifying:** User adoption concerns doubled from 16% to 33% despite product improvements. The buyer-user mismatch problem is worsening, not improving.  
     
5. **Multi-Source Integration Is Strongest Differentiation:** Data integration capability jumped from 18% to 43% resonance \- 2.4x increase represents strongest positive signal across all categories.

**Strategic Recommendations:**

- **Immediate:** Develop comprehensive Clay competitive battle card with concrete differentiation points (data quality, scale, enterprise features)  
- **Q1 Priority:** Deliver Gong/Chorus integration to address conversation intelligence gap affecting 50% of pipeline  
- **Q1 Priority:** Create Clay-style visual workflow builder to neutralize competitive threat  
- **Ongoing:** Simplify integration process and expand CRM platform support beyond Salesforce
