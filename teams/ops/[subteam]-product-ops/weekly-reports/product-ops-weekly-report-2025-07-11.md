# **Product Ops Executive Roundup - July 7-11**

## **Executive Summary**

July release materials are complete and going out today. Sam\'s VOC tool
is stuck in deployment with a 16-person Slack thread - the company is
not set up for internal innovation - will likely need escalation.
Kristin finished planning one-pagers across all PM teams - everyone
aligned on deliverables through August 1st. Critical issue: we spent 50%
of our time tracking people down for basic tasks instead of building.
Need to seriously reinvest our energy in improving the AI PMM system to
eliminate this waste.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**July Release Delivered**: Brett and Ken got all materials out despite
last-minute thrashing from stakeholders. Gage is sending the release
today with only one implementation guide remaining. The process worked
but exposed how much time gets wasted chasing people for uploads and
document completion.

**Planning Process Complete**: Kristin delivered one-pagers from all PM
teams except 3 who were on vacation. Teams now have a clear vision of
deliverables and the critical path through August 1st. TPM will
coordinate engineering readiness and the summary went to the channel
highlighting key risks and dependencies.

**System Infrastructure Progress**: The team identified key improvements
needed for PM document quality and VOC integration. Ken and Brett
outlined next steps for streamlining the release process and reducing
manual coordination overhead.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Release Management**: July materials are complete and going out today.
Only remaining item is one implementation guide with Adam. Team learned
that 50% of time was spent tracking people down rather than building -
need to automate or eliminate this overhead.

**VOC Tool Deployment**: Sam navigated security review and got architect
approval. Tool has GTM Studio filtering capability. Now stuck in
16-person Slack thread trying to get deployment sorted. Every person
suggests talking to someone else - classic deployment hell.

**Planning Coordination**: All one-pagers completed and teams moved to
step 3 (initiative definition and prototyping). Instructions sent out
with August 1st Jira deadline. Kristin handling checkpoints and ensuring
teams stay on track.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Deployment Infrastructure**: Company has no clear path for internal
tools. Sam\'s been passed around to 16 different people with no clear
decision maker. This will block every future internal tool. Someone
needs to own this problem at the executive level.

**Communication Overload**: Planning updates, release coordination, and
OP model changes all happening simultaneously. People getting
overwhelmed with multiple channels and unclear priorities. Need
immediate consolidation.

**Manual Process Overhead**: Release process revealed that half the time
gets spent on administrative tasks - chasing uploads, tracking document
completion, answering basic questions. Need to eliminate this waste.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Process Efficiency**: The release process showed that building tools
is the fun part - nagging people to do basic tasks is what kills
productivity. Team needs to focus on eliminating administrative overhead
through automation or process redesign.

**System Integration**: Getting quality PM documents is critical for
everything else to work. Current quality is C+ level. Next week\'s focus
is improving document quality and integrating deep VOC data to
supplement PM inputs.

**Infrastructure Reality**: Company infrastructure is designed for
customer-facing products, not internal innovation. This systematic gap
affects velocity and needs executive-level attention.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Support and knowledge center processes need complete overhaul. Current
implementation guide and technical support approach doesn\'t scale. This
requires broader organizational involvement beyond just the Product Ops
team.

## **Looking Ahead**

With July release complete, the team is pivoting to significantly
reinvest in the AI PMM system. Time to level up from execution mode to
building sustainable infrastructure.

Ken and Daniel are focusing on dramatically improving PM document
quality - the foundation that everything else depends on. Current C+
quality isn\'t good enough. Sam\'s deep VOC integration will supplement
PM inputs once deployment is resolved. The goal is creating a system
that produces consistently high-quality outputs without manual
intervention.

Kristin is tackling the broader infrastructure challenge: streamlining
the entire release process end-to-end and automating technical support.
This isn\'t just process improvement - it\'s building the operating
system for how Product Ops scales. The July release proved the concept
works, now it\'s time to eliminate the remaining manual overhead and
build something sustainable.
