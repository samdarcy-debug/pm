# **PMM Engine Executive Roundup - 11/3**

## **Executive Summary**

AJ Belen\'s team successfully completed the Go-to-Market Workspace
rebrand with all assets updated and deployed to the field this week,
including the finalized platform narrative deck that rolled out to
sellers. The team is now pivoting to address a significant gap in AI
Action Credit enablement: while foundational training on mechanics and
pricing has been completed, sales lacks the positioning, talk tracks,
and objection handling needed to actually sell credits effectively.
Dominik Facher and Victor are escalating this to AR, Tuna, and James to
drive urgency, with early signals showing substantial revenue
potential---SurveyMonkey\'s usage would extrapolate to \$700K annually,
and ZoomInfo\'s internal usage suggests \$350K in incremental revenue.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Jennifer Scharrer finalized and shipped the platform narrative deck
after incorporating Friday stakeholder feedback, with Ellie providing
final design versions for upload to Seismic. The Go-to-Market Studio
two-pager also reached completion this week and was delivered to Henry,
addressing a standing request from field leadership.

AJ Belen led the sprint to update all collateral from \"Copilot
Workspace\" to \"Go-to-Market Workspace,\" ensuring consistency across
seismic, docket, and supporting documentation. The team completed this
rebrand without any reported issues or gaps reaching the field,
demonstrating strong execution under tight timelines.

Brett Jacobs made progress on the Voice of Customer tool despite
technical setbacks, working with William on the chatbot team and Ryan
Stevens on the Agentic platform to resolve timeout issues. The tool
analyzed 700K+ customer conversations from Mid-Market Plus accounts over
three months, surfacing pain point patterns that provide clear
directional insight for product prioritization.

### **Goals & Progress**

**GTM Studio & GTM Workspace**: The platform narrative deck is finalized
and in the field, with the Go-to-Market Studio two-pager completed and
delivered to Henry. Jennifer Scharrer kicked off deeper collaboration
with Victor and Dylan Holliday to improve Workspace artifact output
quality, focusing on standardizing five core artifact types with
scalable design patterns. The team is establishing a knowledge
management loop across docket, foundational documents, and messaging
frameworks to ensure consistency as the product evolves.

**AI Action Credits**: Tria completed revisions on the economic buyer
asset, with the end user version in progress. AJ Belen identified that
sales has foundational knowledge of how credits work but lacks the
positioning and talk tracks to sell them effectively---a gap that
enablement considers resolved but the field experiences as incomplete.
Victor, Adam, and Dominik aligned on escalating this to leadership, with
plans to develop more offensive positioning assets involving Jennifer
Scharrer and potentially Jesse Lindstrom plus an AE with prior AI credit
selling experience.

**PMM Engine Infrastructure**: Brett Jacobs\' Voice of Customer tool hit
implementation blockers this week related to processing large datasets
through the Agentic platform, causing timeout issues in the micro app.
The team is working through solutions but expects to encounter
additional obstacles before achieving a sustainable, automated pipeline.
Daniel is focusing on clarifying the knowledge loop process across
stakeholders including Marcella, enablement, launch ops, and PMs to
establish clear ownership of information updates.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The AI Action Credit enablement gap represents a significant missed
opportunity. Sales received training on mechanics and pricing---the
foundational \"nuts and bolts\"---but lacks the value positioning,
discovery questions, objection handling, and talk tracks needed to
confidently sell credits. Enablement considers the work complete, while
the field is equipped only for defensive conversations rather than
proactive selling. With usage data showing SurveyMonkey on pace for
\$700K annually and internal ZoomInfo usage suggesting \$350K in
incremental revenue, this gap has material top-line implications.
Dominik and Victor are engaging AR, Tuna, and James to drive alignment,
and the team is exploring resources including Kyle Poirier (Growth
Unhinged newsletter expert on product-led growth and credits) and Manny
Medina\'s new AI credit platform company.

Brett Jacobs is struggling to identify which sales calls discussed
Workspace and Studio at scale. Chorus tagging returns insufficient
results, and the chatbot can\'t process enough calls to surface
meaningful patterns---initial queries returned only four calls when
significantly more exist. The team is working with Russell to analyze
the approximately 7,000-8,000 accounts in territories owned by
Lauderman, Lazer, and Lincoln, limiting scope from the full 40,000
account universe. If this approach doesn\'t succeed by Sunday, it
signals a broader company capability gap since enablement requires this
analysis for multiple use cases. The team can execute manual one-off
analyses if needed, but establishing a sustainable, automated pipeline
remains the objective.

Enablement continues operating reactively, fulfilling field requests as
they arrive and pulling PMM into commitments without strategic
resourcing discussions. Jennifer Scharrer flagged multiple instances
this week where work was promised without PMM consultation, creating
misalignment on priorities and capacity. The team agreed not to accept
requests reflexively and to partner with enablement on strategic
prioritization before committing resources.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Early AI Action Credit usage data reveals compelling revenue expansion
potential that strengthens the case for better enablement.
SurveyMonkey\'s weekly usage, when extrapolated annually, suggests
\$700K in incremental revenue from a single customer. ZoomInfo\'s
internal usage across teams would generate approximately \$350K
annually. These aren\'t small incremental gains but represent 50-70%
growth trajectories that could meaningfully change forecasts. The gap
between this potential and current sales capability makes positioning
and talk track development an urgent priority rather than a nice-to-have
follow-up to foundational training.

Jennifer Scharrer uncovered a key insight working with Victor on
Workspace artifacts: the team wants chat outputs to more frequently
produce artifacts rather than text responses, with these artifacts
meeting or exceeding the quality of what sellers create manually. This
requires standardizing design patterns across five core artifact types,
bringing Jennifer\'s content and deck-building expertise to bear on
making the outputs formulaic and scalable. This work has broader
implications for product velocity since better default outputs reduce
friction in seller adoption.

The team\'s release process thinking is evolving beyond traditional
monthly cycles. Ken and Brett explored using GTM Studio and Workspace to
personalize release communications at the account level---combining
release information with account-specific data from Studio to help reps
understand which updates matter for their customers. While this will
likely surface product limitations, solving this use case would unlock
numerous similar automation opportunities across the business. The team
is building a proof-of-concept with one CSM ahead of the release
workshop to demonstrate art-of-the-possible rather than delivering a
finished solution.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

The team\'s relationship with enablement requires calibration around
request intake and strategic prioritization. Multiple instances this
week involved enablement committing PMM resources to field requests
without prior consultation, then creating tension when PMM questioned
the commitments. Emily\'s team recently reprimanded Jennifer Scharrer
for working with Nikki/Kayla to upload content to Seismic without
looping Emily in, despite the enablement team making the upload
themselves. AJ Belen, Jennifer, and Brett agreed to push back on
reactive requests and insist on strategic discussions before accepting
new work, ensuring alignment on what moves the business forward versus
simply fulfilling inbound demands.

Collaboration with Victor\'s team is deepening productively. Jennifer
Scharrer is now supporting Victor and Dylan Holliday on improving
Workspace artifact quality, bringing PMM expertise to product
development in a way that should improve adoption outcomes. The team
also needs clearer communication around the knowledge management loop
across docket questions, foundational documents, and product updates,
with Daniel working to establish shared understanding across Marcella,
enablement, launch ops, and PM teams about ownership and processes.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week the team focuses on mapping out key activities for Workspace
and Studio through year-end, moving from reactive firefighting to
proactive planning. AJ Belen and Jennifer Scharrer will document what
needs to happen and when, then socialize with Sneh and Victor to
pressure-test assumptions and identify gaps.

Jennifer Scharrer continues supporting Victor on standardizing Workspace
artifacts and will develop a launch process proposal while the team
finalizes swim lanes ahead of Lauren\'s return. She\'s also committed to
providing enablement with use case materials and historical context
they\'ve been requesting. Brett Jacobs aims to unblock the Voice of
Customer tool and roll it out to PMs next week, pending resolution of
the timeout issues, and will review the tool with AJ, Jennifer, and
Aksheth before communicating broadly. The team will also review the plan
for identifying Workspace and Studio sales calls once Russell\'s
analysis returns Sunday, escalating if the approach doesn\'t yield a
sustainable solution.

The AI Action Credit positioning work represents the highest-leverage
opportunity. Once Dominik and Victor secure leadership alignment with
AR, Tuna, and James, Jennifer Scharrer will lead development of
offensive positioning assets, potentially bringing in Jesse Lindstrom
and the recently hired AE with AI credit experience. The team is also
exploring external expertise from Kyle Poirier and examining Manny
Medina\'s new AI credit platform for messaging insights. Getting sales
equipped to proactively sell credits rather than just defend them could
unlock 50-70% revenue growth trajectories based on early usage patterns.
