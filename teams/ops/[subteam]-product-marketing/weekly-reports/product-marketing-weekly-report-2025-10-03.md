# **Product Marketing Executive Roundup - September 29, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The PMM team has made substantial progress enabling the marketing
organization with direct access to product content, with 18 unique users
actively engaging with the agent in its first week. AJ Belen\'s work
with Carl Koussan-Price and his team on the Workspace product has
generated overwhelmingly positive feedback, demonstrating immediate
value through rapid iteration cycles. The team continues advancing Tier
1 launch readiness while developing foundational systems for document
management that will support future scaling.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

AJ Belen successfully enabled Tal\'s marketing organization with direct
access to the product marketing content agent, removing friction from
content discovery and usage. The feedback has been overwhelmingly
positive with only minor formatting requests, and 18 unique users have
already engaged with the agent within the first week. This represents a
shift from gatekept content to self-service enablement that will
compound as usage patterns emerge.

The Workspace initiative saw significant momentum through rapid
iteration with Carl Koussan-Price\'s team. AJ Belen facilitated quick
feedback cycles on the Workspace elevator pitch, completing it in
approximately 30 seconds on Friday. This velocity demonstrates the value
of embedded collaboration and real-time refinement, allowing the team to
maintain alignment while moving at the speed needed for launch
readiness.

Jennifer Scharer advanced Tier 1 launch deliverables to ensure all
required materials will be ready for launch timing. The successful Tier
1 rollout remains on track for the second half, with pitch deck
completion progressing alongside Design team efforts led by Carlos and
Adam on the Workspace Sizzle reel video content and messaging framework
development for GTM Studio.

### **Goals & Progress**

**GTM Studio & Context Service Enablement**: AJ Belen\'s high-leverage
goal to deepen understanding of user performance in Workspace has
yielded valuable directional insights. The team now has clearer answers
to the three value pillars aligned with Victor\'s framework: how users
interact with pre-made artifacts, the types of questions that generate
useful responses, and the effectiveness of session recordings in
Datadog. The usage of the cross-product marketing content agent
delivered immediate positive feedback, with Carl Koussan-Price
confirming on Friday that the Workspace elevator pitch was completed
remarkably fast. Launch operations planning work with the Launch Ops
team and CX/CS collaboration continues to capture needs for the launch
plan.

**GTM Copilot Workspace Launch Preparation**: Jennifer Scharer is
ensuring all Tier 1 launch deliverables are positioned for timely
delivery. The Workspace Field FAQ is now complete, with pitch deck
completion currently in progress with the Design team. The Workspace
onboarding sheet has been finalized in collaboration with Carlos and
Adam, and the Workspace persona video product content along with the GTM
Studio Messaging Framework are advancing. Foundations deck
implementation and stakeholder feedback collection continue, with
successful Tier 1 rollout remaining the priority for the second half.

**Document Management System Development**: Brett Jacobs is working to
establish the foundational system for keeping PMM documents updated and
easily navigable. The goal is to build out a system and process that
ensures the team can maintain document currency without requiring
agents. While the specifics of the system are still being refined, this
work addresses a persistent challenge around source document management
that will become increasingly important as the team scales its content
production.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The team faces ongoing challenges around content alignment and sharing
across Carl Koussan-Price\'s teams. AJ Belen has observed that people
frequently come to meetings expecting different documents than what was
planned, and teams aren\'t consistently sharing assets back with the
broader group or through established channels. This creates inefficiency
and requires addressing with Tal and her leadership team to establish
clearer expectations around content collaboration and feedback loops.

Launch planning coordination remains complex, with the need to balance
multiple workstreams across enablement, CX/CS integration, and product
readiness. While progress continues, ensuring all stakeholders remain
aligned on timing and deliverables requires ongoing attention and clear
communication paths.

The document management challenge, while Brett Jacobs is working to
address it systematically, reflects a broader need for scalable content
operations. The team needs a sustainable approach that doesn\'t rely
solely on individual effort to keep materials current and discoverable,
particularly as content volume grows with multiple product launches in
flight.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The cross-product marketing content agent deployment revealed immediate
adoption when friction is removed from content access. Eighteen unique
users in the first week, combined with overwhelmingly positive feedback,
validates the hypothesis that marketing teams want self-service access
to product content rather than going through intermediaries. The minor
formatting requests that came in represent easily addressable
refinements rather than fundamental issues with the approach. This
suggests the team should continue investing in tools that enable direct
content access and usage.

The rapid iteration on Workspace messaging with Carl Koussan-Price\'s
team demonstrated the power of embedded collaboration. Completing the
elevator pitch in 30 seconds through real-time feedback represents a
dramatically different cadence than traditional review cycles would
allow. This working model should be replicated where possible, as it
maintains both quality and velocity while strengthening cross-functional
relationships.

The persistent pattern of meeting participants expecting different
documents than planned signals a systemic issue rather than isolated
incidents. This indicates the team needs more structured communication
about what content exists, where it lives, and how it should be used.
The root cause appears to be inconsistent asset sharing and feedback
loops, which creates information asymmetry across teams working on
related initiatives.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Collaboration with Carl Koussan-Price\'s marketing team on Workspace
continues to be essential for launch success. The team has established
strong working relationships that enable rapid iteration, as evidenced
by the Friday elevator pitch completion. However, the ongoing challenge
of document expectations and asset sharing needs to be addressed to
maintain this velocity. AJ Belen plans to work with Tal and her
leadership team to establish clearer protocols around content
collaboration and feedback sharing.

The Design team partnership with Carlos and Adam remains important for
completing the Workspace Sizzle reel and visual materials. Jennifer
Scharer\'s coordination with this team on pitch deck development and
onboarding materials is progressing well, with clear ownership and
timelines established.

Launch Ops and enablement teams are providing important input on launch
planning requirements. The ongoing dialogue with these teams ensures the
PMM deliverables align with broader go-to-market needs and timing,
though this coordination requires continued attention as launch dates
approach.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s focus centers on advancing Workspace launch readiness while
scaling the content enablement systems that have shown early success.
The team will continue refinement of messaging and positioning materials
while addressing the systemic challenges around content sharing and
document management.

AJ Belen will complete the full draft of the minideck on platform
narrative for the Workspace launch, building on the successful elevator
pitch work completed this week. The Workspace Messaging & Positioning
document and FAQ work will continue with iteration on Copilot 1.0 versus
Workspace positioning. Studio FAQ/Seller FAQ development and Pitch Deck
Slides work will progress alongside Context Service launch planning. The
team needs to finalize the drive usage approach for the agent and
continue collecting feedback to refine the content delivery model based
on user patterns.

Jennifer Scharer will continue driving Tier 1 launch deliverables
forward, with particular focus on messaging framework finalization and
enabling materials. Brett Jacobs will work to establish the document
management system that can scale with the team\'s growing content needs.
The team\'s ability to maintain rapid iteration cycles while ensuring
comprehensive launch coverage will determine how effectively they can
support the Workspace launch and establish patterns for future product
introductions.
