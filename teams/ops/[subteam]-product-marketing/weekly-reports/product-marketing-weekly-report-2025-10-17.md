# Product Marketing Executive Roundup - October 17, 2025

## Executive Summary

The team is two weeks out from the GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace
launch, with solid momentum on foundational positioning work and launch
readiness. AJ Belen completed a comprehensive internal brand narrative
draft that will undergo review with key go-to-market leaders including
Mark, Molly, Breyers, Tuna, Laser, and AR, while Brett Jacobs secured
buy-in from Adam Severance and Sean on an innovative content creation
and knowledge management loop. The primary challenge ahead is
translating AI credit complexity into clear customer-facing materials,
which AJ describes as generating significant anxiety due to varying
stakeholder perspectives on simplicity. With Jennifer Scarrer returning
Monday and the launch readiness assessment scheduled for that day, the
team is well-positioned to close remaining gaps in the final sprint.

## This Week\'s Progress

### Key Momentum Areas

AJ Belen advanced the internal brand narrative significantly, creating a
fleshed-out document that focuses primarily on ZoomInfo\'s data
foundation and execution tools like GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace
rather than just the Context Service. The narrative is ready for
stakeholder review with senior go-to-market leaders, with plans to
develop customer-facing slides next week once internal alignment is
confirmed. This sequencing approach prioritizes substance over visuals,
ensuring the positioning foundation is solid before investing in
formatting.

Brett Jacobs achieved an important breakthrough with Adam Severance and
Sean on establishing a scalable content creation loop. The concept
addresses Adam\'s team\'s biggest pain point: constant requests to
repackage information in different formats while simultaneously keeping
materials current amid rapid product velocity. By creating a centralized
knowledge source that product managers contribute to, the team can
generate needed materials without overwhelming downstream teams with
redundant work.

Jennifer Scarrer made progress on GTM Studio V1 messaging work with AJ
Belen and Sneh, completing the GTM Studio 2-pager draft, the GTM Studio
Foundations deck, and initial work comparing GTM Studio against Adam
Severance\'s Workspace documentation. Her return from three days out of
office on Monday will provide crucial capacity as the team enters the
final two-week sprint before launch.

### Goals & Progress

**GTM Studio & Copilot Workspace Launch**: The team has reached the
two-week countdown to launch with most foundational materials in place.
Internal brand narrative documentation is complete and awaiting
stakeholder review, while messaging frameworks for both products are
nearing completion. The launch readiness meeting scheduled for Monday
will surface any remaining gaps that will become priority work items for
the final sprint. Key deliverables for next week include finalizing the
brand narrative, creating customer-facing slides, and developing AI
credit explanation materials.

**Content Creation & Knowledge Management**: Brett Jacobs and his team
established a proof of concept for automated content generation that
addresses a significant pain point identified by Adam Severance. The
solution connects pull requests from Backstage with Jira tickets and
product manager context to automatically document product changes week
to week. While the team acknowledges uncertainty about whether this will
land somewhere between \"useless\" and \"incredible,\" the approach
offers potential to reduce the burden on product teams operating at high
velocity while preventing assets from becoming stale. Daniel and Ken are
now driving this forward, with Daniel focused on the knowledge
infrastructure and Ken handling content updates and creation.

**Voice of Customer & Discovery Processes**: With the voice of customer
documentation now in a stable place, Kristen will focus on
reestablishing the discovery and feedback loops that had been
deprioritized during the intense launch preparation period. Dominik has
been advocating for this rebalancing, emphasizing the need for a single
source of truth capturing what customers and internal stakeholders are
requesting. Mary will work on developing version one of this
consolidated view, ensuring the team maintains connection to customer
needs even while executing on launch deliverables.

### Strategic Challenges

The team faces its most significant challenge in creating
customer-facing AI credit slides, which AJ describes as generating
considerable anxiety. Multiple stakeholders have characterized the task
as simple, but AJ disputes this assessment, noting that what Ali and
Adam consider straightforward represents fundamentally different
perspectives that create real complexity. The disconnect between
stakeholder expectations of simplicity and the actual nuances of
explaining AI credits to customers creates risk for the launch. AJ plans
to leverage Brett Jacobs as a sounding board next week specifically
because he has deep platform knowledge without being immersed in the
daily AI credit conversations, providing a valuable outside-in
perspective on clarity.

Brett Jacobs\' team is pursuing an experimental approach to automated
release documentation that carries inherent uncertainty. The challenge
of translating engineering-level information from pull requests into
content suitable for downstream teams and customers is substantial, as
evidenced by how Sean\'s how-to guides became outdated within 2-3 weeks
despite being created quickly with AI assistance. The team openly
acknowledges they don\'t yet know where on the spectrum from \"useless
to incredible\" this solution will land, though it won\'t be perfect.
The solution also won\'t replace feature info packs unless Jira hygiene
improves dramatically, creating some scope ambiguity that needs
continued refinement.

Capacity constraints remain a factor, though Jennifer Scarrer\'s return
Monday will provide relief. The team has been operating with reduced
resources during a high-intensity period, which contributed to the need
to deprioritize discovery and feedback work in favor of launch
deliverables. The upcoming launch readiness meeting on Monday, running
two and a half to three hours, will likely surface additional gaps that
will compete for attention during the final two-week sprint. AJ made the
strategic decision to exclude Brett from this meeting to preserve his
capacity for higher-leverage work.

## Strategic Insights

### Key Learnings & Discoveries

The internal brand narrative development revealed an important insight
about positioning focus. While Context Service has been a significant
topic of discussion, the stronger positioning story centers on
ZoomInfo\'s data foundation combined with execution tools like GTM
Studio and Copilot Workspace. This realization, which emerged through
AJ\'s drafting process, suggests the team should lead with the data and
execution tool value proposition rather than overweighting the Context
Service in customer conversations. The shift in emphasis better aligns
with what customers actually buy and use, making the overall narrative
more grounded and compelling.

Brett Jacobs\' conversations with Adam Severance uncovered that the real
bottleneck for fast-moving product teams isn\'t creating initial
materials---it\'s keeping them current amid constant change. Adam
identified that the Workspace team ships every week, which creates both
a higher burden to inform downstream teams and causes rapid asset
obsolescence. This finding challenges the assumption that the primary
need is generating more content upfront. Instead, the bigger opportunity
lies in creating systems that automatically reflect product changes,
reducing manual updating burden and ensuring accuracy. Sean\'s
experience with his how-to guides becoming outdated in 2-3 weeks despite
quick AI-assisted creation validates this insight.

The team discovered through Adam\'s feedback that many requests his team
receives are essentially repackaging existing information in different
formats. This pattern suggests significant inefficiency in how knowledge
flows through the organization. By establishing a centralized,
maintained knowledge source that can be queried and reformatted
programmatically, the team could dramatically reduce repetitive work
while improving consistency. The insight also reveals that the problem
isn\'t lack of information but rather lack of accessible, reusable
formats for that information---a systems problem rather than a content
problem.

### Cross-Team Dependencies

The team\'s work with Adam Severance and Sean on Copilot Workspace has
evolved into a strong collaborative partnership with clear mutual
benefit. Adam provided valuable buy-in for the knowledge management and
content generation approach, while the Product Marketing team is helping
solve real pain points his team faces with constant information requests
and outdated materials. The relationship with Victor, Sneh, and Adam
will be important for the upcoming platform narrative work, with AJ
noting the need for dedicated time with these stakeholders to review the
brand narrative and ensure alignment on how products are framed and how
everything fits together conceptually.

The enablement partnership with Mickey has surfaced both opportunities
and challenges. Mickey has built an impressive account intelligence
agent that demonstrates sophisticated use cases for the valued
framework, but Brett observed that it\'s \"too much stuff\" for reps or
customers to easily digest. This observation led to Brett\'s work on
simplifying the framework with Dominik, focusing on starting with
customer problems and pain points before layering in product solutions.
The dependency here requires careful navigation---leveraging Mickey\'s
technical capabilities while ensuring materials remain accessible and
actionable for sellers.

## Looking Ahead

The team enters the final two-week sprint before GTM Studio and Copilot
Workspace launch with clear priorities and strong foundational work in
place. The focus shifts from building positioning frameworks to
translating them into customer-facing materials and filling identified
gaps.

AJ Belen will lead the Monday launch readiness meeting to surface
remaining deliverable gaps, then turn attention to finalizing the brand
narrative based on stakeholder input from the review session with
go-to-market leaders. The customer-facing slides need development next
week, potentially over the weekend if capacity allows. The most
challenging work will be creating AI credit explanation materials, where
AJ plans to leverage Brett as a sounding board specifically because his
platform knowledge without daily immersion in AI credit discussions will
provide valuable perspective on clarity. Jennifer Scarrer\'s return
provides crucial capacity for messaging and foundational materials work,
including completing the GTM Studio V1 messaging and positioning
documents. The team needs to balance launch urgency with quality,
ensuring materials genuinely simplify complex concepts rather than just
claiming to do so.

Brett Jacobs will continue the experimental work on automated release
documentation with Daniel and Ken, understanding that results may fall
anywhere on the usefulness spectrum. More importantly, he\'s shifting
focus back toward discovery and feedback loops after weeks of intense
launch preparation. Kristen will work on establishing a single source of
truth for customer and stakeholder requests, while Mary develops the
initial version of this consolidated view. Brett also plans to finalize
his use case simplification framework with Dominik, potentially
providing sellers with a more approachable way to discuss ZoomInfo\'s
value proposition by starting with customer problems rather than product
features. The team recognizes the need to rebalance toward earlier-stage
product development lifecycle work while still executing flawlessly on
the imminent launch. Success next week means closing launch gaps while
reestablishing the discovery and feedback practices that create
long-term product-market fit.
