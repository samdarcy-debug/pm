# **Analytics Team Executive Roundup - July 11, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**Account health measurement methodology reaches 90% completion with ELT
alignment meeting scheduled for Thursday.** AJ Belen has successfully
navigated stakeholder complexity to achieve consensus on the overall
approach, with only implementation details remaining. The team
demonstrates strong momentum across product adoption analysis, dashboard
development, and cross-functional collaboration, positioning us well for
strategic decision-making and improved account activation.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Product Adoption Beta Analysis Shows Promising Results**: Preetham
Srinithi completed comprehensive analysis revealing beta accounts
consistently outperform control groups by 4 percentage points in
provisioned-to-seats ratio over the past 4 weeks. Copilot engagement has
reached parity with control groups, with median interactions showing
strong convergence and potential for overtaking in upcoming weeks.

**Dashboard Development Drives Cross-Team Collaboration**: Nanxi Ge
completed wireframe design for ZIM+ dashboard, generating stakeholder
excitement through proactive sales and marketing team engagement. The
approach of pre-socializing dashboard capabilities has already
identified significant gaps in account manager knowledge and created
momentum for proactive account outreach strategies.

**Onboarding Intelligence Reaches Decision Point**: The team
successfully identified key differentiators between mid-touch and
high-touch onboarding models, discovering that package types (Advanced
vs Enterprise) and live meeting frequency drive engagement differences.
This analysis provides foundation for future onboarding optimization
while reaching natural conclusion for current investigation.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Account Health Methodology**: 90% complete with methodology alignment
achieved between onboarding and post-onboarding approaches. AJ Belen has
successfully managed stakeholder expectations, shifting from
perfectionist approach to pragmatic implementation focusing on top
customer scenarios. Thursday\'s ELT meeting will validate approach using
2-3 representative accounts rather than full reporting rollout.

**Dashboard Development & Automation**: Nanxi Ge has completed
stakeholder analysis phase and is transitioning to technical
implementation. ZDP data access requests submitted with documentation
processes established. Dashboard architecture designed to support all CI
accounts, not just ZIM+Copilot, creating broader analytical value and
comparison capabilities.

**Product Adoption Reporting**: Preetham Srinithi achieved 99%
automation of beta analysis reporting with Google Sheets integration
resolved. Apps Script implementation creates stable data pipeline immune
to manual sheet modifications. Summary analysis ready for Monday
stakeholder distribution with confluence documentation complete.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Data Access and Infrastructure Dependencies**: Multiple team members
encountering ZDP access delays and documentation gaps in legacy
dashboards. Nanxi Ge experienced delays accessing specific tables, while
Preetham Srinithi navigated Google Sheets naming inconsistencies. The
team would benefit from streamlined data access protocols and better
documentation of existing analytical assets.

**Resource Allocation and Diminishing Returns**: Farrell Tanuwidjaja\'s
onboarding touchpoint analysis has reached diminishing returns despite
identifying valid patterns. The team correctly identified this as a
rabbit hole requiring stakeholder conversation about actionable
outcomes. AJ Belen is reallocating resources toward tableau cleanup and
conversion dashboard work with Preetham Srinithi.

**Integration Between Analytics and Operations**: While dashboard
development shows promise, the path to operational activation through ZI
chatbot integration remains unclear. Russell\'s team readiness for data
ingestion lacks visibility into current implementation status, requiring
more proactive engineering coordination and notification systems.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Perfect Is the Enemy of Good in Account Health**: The account health
methodology project revealed how stakeholder desire for comprehensive
coverage can impede practical implementation. AJ Belen\'s learning about
focusing on top 3-5 customer scenarios rather than accommodating all
edge cases provides valuable framework for future analytical projects
requiring executive alignment.

**Cross-Functional Dashboard Design Drives Adoption**: Nanxi Ge\'s
approach of engaging sales and marketing teams during dashboard design
phase, rather than post-completion, generated unexpected enthusiasm and
identified genuine business gaps. Sales managers expressed excitement
about proactive account identification capabilities they\'ve never had
access to, suggesting strong adoption potential.

**Automation Strategies Reduce Operational Friction**: Preetham
Srinithi\'s Apps Script implementation demonstrates how investing in
automation infrastructure upfront prevents downstream operational
issues. Creating protected duplicate sheets with automated modeling
reduces impact of manual data entry errors while maintaining
accessibility for stakeholders.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Russell\'s engineering team on ZI chatbot data integration
requires increased visibility and coordination. AJ Belen is pushing for
notification systems and data repository logging to track ingestion
progress, while also advocating for tenant health dashboard data
migration to internal semantic layer. Igor\'s development of query
capabilities and data availability features will be critical for
operational success.

The integration team collaboration on onboarding analysis has reached
natural conclusion with actionable insights delivered. Andreas has not
indicated additional research needs, allowing team to reallocate
analytical resources toward higher-impact dashboard development and
product adoption work.

## **Looking Ahead**

**Account health methodology validation and ELT alignment take
priority**, with Thursday\'s meeting determining implementation timeline
and stakeholder confidence. Success here unlocks broader analytical
capabilities and establishes team credibility for future strategic
initiatives.

**Dashboard development and automation infrastructure** represent our
biggest opportunity for operational impact. Nanxi Ge\'s ZIM+ dashboard
completion, combined with Preetham Srinithi\'s amplitude integration
work, will provide stakeholders with unprecedented analytical
capabilities. The team\'s focus on cross-functional design and automated
data pipelines positions us well for sustainable analytical operations.

**Resource optimization through strategic project selection** will guide
our approach to new requests. The team\'s experience with onboarding
analysis demonstrates our ability to identify diminishing returns and
redirect resources toward higher-impact work, a crucial capability as
analytical demands increase across the organization.
