**Product BI Executive Roundup - September 12, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Phoebe\'s team successfully secured the August renewal prediction score
data today after delays from Tony\'s team, enabling critical ELT meeting
preparation. Meanwhile, Nanxi has established a strategic partnership
with Enterprise Manager Michael to jointly identify churn and renewal
patterns, transforming a simple data request into ongoing collaboration.
With Copilot V2 launching October 6th and six new Workbook features
rolling out, the team is rapidly scaling analytics infrastructure while
managing multiple product launches simultaneously.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Nanxi turned a routine enterprise manager request into a strategic
partnership opportunity, discovering shared goals around churn
prediction and creating a collaborative framework where both teams
provide complementary insights - the enterprise team conducting customer
interviews while analytics provides data-driven patterns.

Phoebe\'s team advanced critical launch preparations by establishing
unified data tracking across Copilot V1 and V2, ensuring seamless user
journey analysis and enabling questions about whether V1 chat users are
engaging with V2 features through a single source table approach.

The team overcame technical infrastructure challenges as Ferrell
connected with the CDP team to manage the deprecation of two key
integration import tables, proactively scheduling table swaps to prevent
disruption to current dashboards and analytics capabilities.

**Goals & Progress**

**Renewal Prediction Analytics**: Phoebe completed initial analysis of
August renewal prediction scores after receiving delayed data from
Tony\'s team, with insights expected by end of day to support ELT
meeting preparation. The team confirmed this delay pattern will likely
recur monthly, establishing second-week expectations for future
reporting cycles.

**Product Launch Analytics**: Preparation for six new Workbook features
and Copilot V2 is advancing through structured weekly meetings with
product managers Sean and Inbal, where requirements translate into
engineering tickets under launch epics. Internal user enablement begins
next week with 100-200 users, growing to full internal deployment by end
of September.

**Integration Data Infrastructure**: Nanxi\'s team addressed integration
data reliability questions from Mark Harris, confirming strong accuracy
for import data and partial coverage for export data, with some vendor
types still missing from export tables. The team clarified that current
import tracking covers only advanced sync, not org import customers.

**Strategic Challenges**

Tal\'s unresponsiveness to multiple requests from Phoebe, Wagun, and
Dipti regarding semantic layer reviews is creating bottlenecks in
chatbot development work. Despite reporting to Nir and having no visible
PTO status, Tal hasn\'t responded to urgent review requests, potentially
indicating shifted priorities or resource constraints that may require
management intervention.

Hiring momentum remains slower than anticipated due to recruiter-side
delays, with Nanxi\'s expected interview schedule pushed to next week
after originally planning significant time allocation this week. While
screening continues, the delayed timeline may impact team scaling plans
and workload distribution.

Technical infrastructure transitions require careful coordination as
both CI playground and existing import tables face deprecation,
necessitating proactive migration planning to maintain analytics
capabilities while supporting ongoing business operations and reporting
requirements.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The enterprise manager collaboration revealed that customer-facing teams
are independently developing churn prediction approaches, suggesting
opportunity for broader analytics partnership models where field
insights enhance data science outputs while analytics provides
systematic pattern recognition at scale.

Integration data analysis uncovered important coverage gaps,
particularly in export tracking across vendor types and complete absence
of org import data from current tables. This finding highlights the need
for comprehensive data audit to ensure executive reporting reflects true
customer integration patterns rather than partial subsets.

Internal Copilot usage data is already providing valuable QA insights,
with the team strategically positioning this internal deployment phase
as both quality assurance and early adoption tracking, creating a
feedback loop that will inform customer rollout strategies.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Tony\'s data team on renewal prediction scores will
require ongoing timeline management, as consistent delays indicate
structural capacity or prioritization challenges that affect monthly
executive reporting cycles. Clear expectations around second-week
delivery windows need establishment to maintain stakeholder confidence.

The collaboration with engineering teams through Inbal and Sean\'s PM
process is creating effective requirement-to-delivery pipelines for
launch analytics, though Tal\'s availability issues could impact
semantic layer development critical for AI chatbot functionality.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on scaling product launch readiness while advancing
strategic partnerships and resolving infrastructure bottlenecks.

Phoebe will complete renewal prediction analysis insights while
coordinating with engineering teams on Workbook and Copilot V2 analytics
preparation, leveraging internal user data as both QA validation and
early adoption metrics. Nanxi will kick off hiring interviews after
recruiter delays while deepening the enterprise manager partnership and
initiating weekly CI chatbot meetings with AJ. The team will also
address Tal\'s unresponsiveness by escalating to Nir if no response by
Monday, ensuring semantic layer reviews don\'t further delay chatbot
development. With internal Copilot users beginning deployment
immediately and customer-facing launch October 6th, the infrastructure
and tracking foundations established this week position the team to
deliver comprehensive analytics from day one of broader rollout.
