# Roadmap: Early Access Marketable Releases

## Quarterly Outlook Q1

**Objective** heading into Q2: Plays Completes the Unify-Orchestrate-Execute Loop. We've had data (Unify) and execution (GTM Workspace), but Plays is the orchestration layer connecting them. We move to event-driven infrastructure with live updates at scale, focused on conversational signals. Customers can define conversational signals like competitive mentions, trigger a play and get reporting against them. Q1 increases our proprietary data foundation and flexibility by expanding identity partnerships and exposing context/tracing of our data for GTM context.
