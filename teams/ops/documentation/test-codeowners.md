# Test CODEOWNERS Self-Approval

This is a test document to verify that ops team members can approve PRs for changes in the `/teams/ops/` folder.

## Expected Behavior

- Sam (ops team member) should be able to approve this PR
- The PR should be mergeable with only Sam's approval (no global admin needed)
- This tests that CODEOWNERS enforcement is working correctly
