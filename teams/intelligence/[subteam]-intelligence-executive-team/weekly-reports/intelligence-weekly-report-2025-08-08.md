# **Business Intelligence Team Executive Roundup - August 8, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The team has identified a critical 50% drop in account health scores
between onboarding and post-onboarding phases (this drop does not
indicate that scores have decreased but rather that the methodologies
are not continuous), revealing a fundamental measurement gap that
requires executive alignment on scoring philosophy. Phoebe Mei\'s
analysis shows accounts categorized as \"good/green\" during onboarding
drop to half that percentage in their first post-onboarding month. AJ
Belen is driving alignment discussions with leadership to establish a
unified approach to account success measurement, with a key decision
meeting scheduled for next week between Mary and Whitney to resolve the
philosophical divide between actionability-focused and renewal
prediction-focused scoring methodologies.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Account Success Measurement Analysis**: Phoebe Mei completed
comprehensive analysis revealing significant gaps between onboarding and
post-onboarding scoring systems, providing concrete data that validates
the need for unified measurement approaches across the customer journey.

**Copilot Feature Development**: Eran advanced the five-year accounts
review for the second round of free accounts, meeting with account
managers to identify usage gaps and finalizing presentation materials
for Monday\'s leadership review following a successful Palo Alto client
call.

**Data Infrastructure Planning**: Inbal Kor progressed toward
implementing Copilot V2 data requirements, positioning the team for beta
launch reporting capabilities once she returns from upcoming PTO
coverage.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Customer Success Scoring**: Phoebe Mei achieved 100% completion on
identifying predictive indicators of success, discovering that existing
onboarding scores poorly correlate with post-onboarding performance and
establishing the need for refined setup criteria and score validation
processes.

**Workbook Engagement Analysis**: Inbal Kor reached 80% completion on
workbook user behavior analysis, identifying that while entitled users
are increasing, active sheet creation is declining with only 32% of 320
entitled users actively creating content, highlighting retention and
feature adoption challenges.

**Account Management Insights**: Eran completed his flywheel-focused
account analysis at 100%, delivering actionable insights to GTM teams
and finalizing leadership presentation materials that will inform
strategic account management approaches.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Scoring System Misalignment**: The fundamental disconnect between
actionability-focused onboarding scores and renewal prediction-focused
post-onboarding metrics is creating measurement blind spots that impact
customer success strategies. AJ Belen has identified this requires
executive decision-making on measurement philosophy before tactical
improvements can be implemented effectively.

**Resource Coverage Gaps**: Inbal Kor\'s planned PTO next week and the
last week of August, combined with Nanxi\'s absence this week and
Preetham\'s departure, is creating coverage challenges during critical
Copilot V2 development phases when beta launch preparation requires
consistent momentum.

**Copilot Adoption Barriers**: Early Copilot usage remains limited at
10% with conversion restricted to 1-2 users per 100 seats, indicating
that current deployment approaches may not be generating the
enterprise-scale operationalization needed for broader AI adoption
across customer accounts.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Customer Journey Measurement Gap**: Phoebe Mei\'s analysis revealed
that traditional onboarding success indicators fail to predict
post-onboarding performance, with a dramatic 50% drop in \"good\"
account classifications after the first month, suggesting that current
measurement frameworks are optimized for initial setup rather than
sustained value realization.

**Workbook Usage Patterns**: Inbal Kor discovered that despite growing
entitled user bases, active engagement is declining with most users
creating single sheets containing minimal data, indicating that current
feature sets may not be meeting evolving customer workflow needs or that
user education gaps are preventing deeper adoption.

**AI Feature Maturity Insights**: Eran\'s account analysis identified
that successful Copilot implementations require significant GTM team
investment and structured go-to-market approaches, contrasting with the
early exploratory adoption patterns that characterize current generative
AI usage across the customer base.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Mary and Whitney\'s teams on account success measurement
alignment is critical for establishing consistent customer journey
tracking. AJ Belen is coordinating next week\'s decision meeting to
resolve the philosophical differences between actionability and renewal
prediction approaches, which will determine tactical scoring system
modifications across all customer-facing teams.

The Copilot V2 beta launch depends on coordination with product and
engineering teams for data infrastructure requirements that Inbal Kor is
managing, requiring sustained technical collaboration during her
upcoming PTO periods to maintain September launch readiness.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s primary focus centers on achieving executive alignment on
account success measurement philosophy through AJ Belen\'s leadership
meeting with Mary and Whitney, which will determine the tactical
direction for the following two weeks of scoring system modifications.

**Measurement Philosophy Resolution**: The Thursday/Friday leadership
meeting represents a critical decision point for unified customer
success tracking approaches, with AJ Belen facilitating alignment
between actionability and renewal prediction objectives that will guide
all subsequent tactical implementation work.

**Copilot Development Continuity**: Eran will advance the second set of
account reviews while incorporating feedback from Monday\'s leadership
presentation, maintaining momentum on AI feature adoption insights
during team coverage transitions.

**Resource Management During Transitions**: With Inbal Kor\'s planned
PTO and Preetham\'s departure, the team is prioritizing Copilot V2 data
infrastructure completion and knowledge transfer to ensure September
beta launch preparation continues without interruption.

The team is well-positioned to deliver the measurement alignment
breakthrough that will unlock more effective customer success
strategies, while maintaining development velocity on next-generation AI
features that drive long-term platform value.
