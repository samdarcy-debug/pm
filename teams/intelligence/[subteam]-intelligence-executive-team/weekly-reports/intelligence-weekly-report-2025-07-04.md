# **Business Intelligence Team Executive Roundup - July 3, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**Critical Integration Onboarding Initiative Shows Promise**: Nanxi Ge
and Farrell Tanuwidjaja have identified actionable hypotheses to
accelerate slow integration onboarding for recent cohorts, with focus
shifting to proving hypothesis #4 around onboarding model benchmarking.
The team achieved 100% completion on key standardization efforts for
monthly reporting (Phoebe Mei) and flywheel metrics validation (Eran
Dayan), while AJ Belen secured methodology alignment for account health
measurement despite stakeholder ownership challenges. Next week requires
executive attention on finalizing account health scoring methodology
before ELT presentation.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Integration Onboarding Investigation Breakthrough**: Farrell
Tanuwidjaja completed comprehensive interviews with Account Managers and
Customer Success Managers, generating validated hypotheses about
integration delays. The team successfully narrowed focus to hypothesis
#4, which will establish onboarding model benchmarks and create early
warning systems for accounts falling outside acceptable timeframes,
directly addressing the core business challenge of slow recent cohort
integration.

**Automated Reporting Infrastructure Complete**: Phoebe Mei successfully
standardized and automated the monthly North Star metrics reporting,
including both average and median converting actions per user per month,
plus Chat AI usage metrics. This eliminates manual reporting overhead
and ensures consistent leadership visibility into key performance
indicators, with final approval pending from leadership by end of week.

**AI Adoption Analysis Reveals Strategic Insights**: Inbal Kor\'s
analysis of AI usage within workbooks shows 30% of users who created
workbook sheets have used at least one AI column, with 42% of all sheets
now including AI columns. Sales and Operations teams lead adoption at
49% usage rate, with AI columns representing 5% of all columns across
ZoomInfo, CSV, and CRM sources, providing clear direction for product
development priorities.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Integration Onboarding Optimization**: Farrell Tanuwidjaja achieved
100% completion on stakeholder interviews and hypothesis generation,
successfully identifying the most promising avenue for improvement.
Current focus on hypothesis #4 will establish benchmark timelines for
different onboarding models and create automated alerting for at-risk
accounts, with validation expected by end of week.

**CI Marketing Renewal Intelligence**: Nanxi Ge completed 60% of planned
customer interviews despite holiday week challenges, successfully
identifying target renewal accounts and generating standardized
questioning framework. Initial responses confirm model accuracy in
identifying interested prospects, with structural and leadership
challenges being primary purchase barriers rather than product fit
issues.

**Reporting Standardization Initiative**: Phoebe Mei achieved 100%
completion on monthly report automation and board meeting data
standardization, successfully implementing North Star metrics tracking
and updating Good Set definitions based on revised factor criteria.
Leadership approval on final definitions expected by end of week,
enabling full automation rollout.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Account Health Methodology Ownership Clarity**: AJ Belen identified a
critical process learning around stakeholder ownership of methodology
definitions. While alignment on post-onboarding health measurement
approach was achieved, the extended timeline revealed that VP-level
stakeholders should drive initial proposals rather than the BI team
seeding definitions, which created misaligned expectations about shared
ownership when clear executive ownership was needed.

**Cross-Functional Integration Dependencies**: The integration
onboarding investigation revealed gaps between Account Manager
capabilities and technical integration requirements. Nanxi Ge\'s renewal
conversations highlighted that many interested prospects face structural
barriers (marketing team organization, leadership transitions) that
require cross-functional coordination beyond traditional sales
approaches.

**Resource Allocation During Holiday Periods**: Multiple team members
experienced reduced productivity during the holiday week, with Nanxi Ge
noting significant communication delays and Farrell requiring additional
support from other team members. This highlights the need for better
holiday period planning and resource reallocation strategies.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**AI Adoption Patterns Reveal Product Development Opportunities**: Inbal
Kor\'s analysis revealed that while AI column adoption is strong (30% of
workbook creators), usage patterns vary significantly by team function.
Sales and Operations teams show 49% adoption rates, while overall AI
columns represent only 5% of total columns, suggesting significant
growth potential. The primary use case centers on account quality
evaluation, fit assessment, and churn risk analysis, indicating clear
product enhancement opportunities.

**Integration Onboarding Model Effectiveness Varies**: Farrell
Tanuwidjaja\'s investigation revealed that different onboarding models
have significantly different success rates and timelines. The research
identified that bugs and technical difficulties in connecting
integrations represent actionable improvement areas, while import
adoption rates vary across onboarding model cohorts, suggesting
optimization opportunities through better model matching.

**Renewal Conversation Quality Drives Outcomes**: Nanxi Ge discovered
that providing context when requesting information leads to more
detailed responses and meaningful conversations. The gap between Account
Managers and Product team expertise emerged as a key insight, with
pairing AMs with product experts during renewal conversations
potentially strengthening narrative and increasing likelihood of renewal
or upsell success.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Integration team on onboarding optimization continues
to be critical for addressing the slow adoption challenge affecting
recent cohorts. Farrell Tanuwidjaja\'s hypothesis validation requires
close collaboration with Product Management to implement technical
solutions for identified integration connection issues, while the
benchmark establishment needs Operations team support for alert system
implementation.

The CI Marketing renewal initiative requires coordination between Sales,
Customer Success, and Product teams to address the structural barriers
identified in prospect conversations. Nanxi Ge\'s findings about
AM-Product team knowledge gaps suggest need for enhanced collaboration
protocols and potentially embedded product expertise in renewal
conversations.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on validation and implementation of key insights
generated this week, with particular emphasis on proving the integration
onboarding hypothesis and establishing automated systems for future
monitoring.

**Integration Onboarding Hypothesis Validation**: Farrell Tanuwidjaja
will complete testing of hypothesis #4, establishing benchmark timelines
for each onboarding model and creating risk assessment framework for
accounts falling outside acceptable ranges. Success depends on data
availability and stakeholder alignment on benchmark definitions. **CI
Marketing Dashboard Development**: Nanxi Ge shifts focus to creating
automated dashboard wireframes for long-term renewal intelligence,
working with Veronica and CI Marketing stakeholders to define
sustainable data sources and update frequencies. **Account Health
Methodology Finalization**: AJ Belen will complete account health
scoring methodology validation by running test accounts through the new
framework before ELT presentation, ensuring methodology robustness and
stakeholder confidence.

The team maintains strong momentum across all initiatives, with clear
paths to value delivery in the coming week. The combination of completed
standardization efforts, validated hypotheses, and strategic insights
positions the team to drive significant business impact through both
immediate tactical improvements and longer-term systematic enhancements.
