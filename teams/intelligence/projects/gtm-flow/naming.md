# The Product Naming Playbook

**A Systematic Process for Naming Products That Work**

---

## Introduction

Most product naming happens through a combination of gut instinct, late-night brainstorming, and whoever shouts loudest in the room. This playbook replaces that chaos with a repeatable, systematic process that produces defensible, effective names.

This guide synthesizes methodologies from:
- First Round Review's naming frameworks
- Google Ventures Design Sprint naming exercises
- Y Combinator's startup naming guidance
- Professional naming agency practices (Lexicon, Igor, Catchword)
- Trademark and brand protection best practices

**What this playbook delivers:**
- A step-by-step process from brief to final name
- Evaluation criteria that remove subjectivity
- Testing methodologies that validate before launch
- Legal and trademark checkpoints
- Templates and exercises for each phase

```

### Time Investment

| Phase | Duration | Key Outputs |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Discovery | 3-5 days | Naming brief, strategic criteria |
| Generation | 5-7 days | 200+ candidate names |
| Screening | 3-5 days | Top 15-20 names |
| Testing | 5-7 days | Top 3-5 validated names |
| Selection | 2-3 days | Final name + backup |

**Total: 4-6 weeks** for a rigorous process. Compress at your own risk.

---

## Part 2: Phase 1 — Discovery

### Purpose

Before generating a single name, you must understand what the name needs to accomplish. Discovery aligns stakeholders and creates objective criteria for evaluation.

### 2.1 The Naming Brief

Every naming project starts with a brief. This document becomes the source of truth for all decisions.

#### Naming Brief Template

```markdown
# Product Naming Brief

## 1. Product Overview
**Product description (2-3 sentences):**
[What does this product do? What problem does it solve?]

**Target user:**
[Who uses this? Be specific about role, industry, context]

**Key differentiator:**
[What makes this different from alternatives?]

**Product category:**
[What category does this fit in? Or is it creating a new category?]

## 2. Strategic Context

**Brand architecture decision:**
□ Standalone brand (new brand, separate from parent)
□ Endorsed brand (new name + parent name, e.g., "Copilot by ZoomInfo")
□ Sub-brand (parent + descriptor, e.g., "ZoomInfo Copilot")
□ Descriptive (pure descriptor, e.g., "ZoomInfo Sales Intelligence")

**Naming hierarchy:**
[Where does this sit? Product line? Feature? Platform?]

**Related products/names in portfolio:**
[List existing names this needs to work alongside]

## 3. Name Requirements

**Must convey:**
[What feelings/ideas/associations are essential?]

**Must avoid:**
[What associations would be harmful?]

**Tone:**
□ Professional/Corporate
□ Friendly/Approachable
□ Technical/Precise
□ Bold/Disruptive
□ Premium/Luxurious
□ Other: ___________

**Linguistic requirements:**
- Languages needed: [e.g., must work in English, Spanish, Mandarin]
- Pronunciation requirements: [easy to say, spell, remember]
- Length constraints: [max characters, syllables]

## 4. Practical Constraints

**Domain requirements:**
□ .com required
□ .com preferred but alternatives acceptable
□ Domain not critical

**Trademark scope:**
- Geographies: [US, EU, Global, etc.]
- Classes: [identify relevant Nice classes]

**Timeline:**
- Names needed by: [date]
- Launch date: [date]

## 5. Stakeholders

**Decision makers:**
[Who has final approval?]

**Key influencers:**
[Who needs to be consulted?]

**Sign-off required from:**
□ Legal
□ Marketing
□ Product
□ Executive
□ Other: ___________

## 6. Inspiration & Direction

**Names we admire (and why):**
1. [Name] — [what we like about it]
2. [Name] — [what we like about it]
3. [Name] — [what we like about it]

**Names we dislike (and why):**
1. [Name] — [what we want to avoid]
2. [Name] — [what we want to avoid]

**Competitive names to be aware of:**
[List competitor product names]
```

### 2.2 Strategic Name Types

Understanding name types helps focus generation. Each type has tradeoffs.

| Type | Description | Examples | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|----------|------|------|
| **Descriptive** | Says what it does | Microsoft Word, General Motors | Instant clarity | Hard to trademark, limiting |
| **Suggestive** | Hints at benefit/quality | Pinterest (pin + interest), Slack | Memorable + meaningful | Requires more marketing |
| **Abstract** | Invented/arbitrary | Kodak, Xerox, Häagen-Dazs | Highly ownable | Requires significant investment |
| **Metaphorical** | Borrowed meaning | Amazon, Apple, Jaguar | Rich associations | Risk of wrong associations |
| **Founder/Place** | Named after origin | Ford, Adobe (creek in NJ) | Human story | Ego-driven, succession issues |
| **Acronym** | Letters standing for words | IBM, BMW | Compact | Often meaningless to outsiders |
| **Compound** | Two words combined | Facebook, YouTube, Salesforce | Clear + ownable | Can feel clunky |

**Recommendation:** For most B2B products, **suggestive** and **compound** names offer the best balance of meaning and trademarkability.

### 2.3 The Positioning Statement

Before naming, clarify positioning. Use this format:

```
For [target customer]
Who [statement of need or opportunity]
[Product name] is a [product category]
That [key benefit/reason to believe]
Unlike [competitive alternative]
Our product [primary differentiation]
```

**Example:**
```
For B2B sales teams
Who need to identify and prioritize the right accounts
Flow is a GTM intelligence platform
That surfaces buying signals across your entire market
Unlike generic CRM tools
Our product combines intent data, company intelligence, and AI to tell you who to call and why
```

### 2.4 Discovery Exercises

#### Exercise 1: The Essence Exercise (30 minutes)

Ask stakeholders to complete independently, then discuss:

1. If this product were a **person**, what 3 adjectives would describe them?
2. If this product were a **car brand**, which would it be? Why?
3. If this product were an **animal**, which would it be? Why?
4. In one word, what **feeling** should users have when using this?
5. What's the **one thing** users should remember about this product?

#### Exercise 2: The Competitor Landscape (45 minutes)

Create a 2x2 matrix mapping competitor names:

```
                    DESCRIPTIVE
                         │
                         │
         Microsoft Word  │  Salesforce
         Google Docs     │  Workday
    SERIOUS ─────────────┼──────────── PLAYFUL
         Oracle          │  Slack
         SAP             │  Notion
                         │
                    ABSTRACT
```

**Ask:** Where do we want to land? Why?

#### Exercise 3: The "But Not" Exercise (20 minutes)

Complete these statements:

- We are **innovative** but not **reckless**
- We are **powerful** but not **complicated**
- We are **intelligent** but not **cold**
- We are **professional** but not **boring**
- We are **[your word]** but not **[opposite/extreme]**

This clarifies the tone corridor for naming.

### 2.5 Discovery Deliverable

End discovery with alignment on:

1. **Name type preference** (descriptive, suggestive, abstract, etc.)
2. **Tone corridor** (where on the spectrums)
3. **Must-haves** (non-negotiable requirements)
4. **Nice-to-haves** (preferences if possible)
5. **Red lines** (what to absolutely avoid)

---

## Part 3: Phase 2 — Generation

### Purpose

Generate a large quantity of name candidates (200+) using structured techniques. Quantity matters because most names will be eliminated in screening.

### 3.1 The Generation Mindset

**Rules for generation sessions:**

1. **No criticism** — judgment comes later
2. **Quantity over quality** — aim for volume
3. **Build on ideas** — "yes, and" not "yes, but"
4. **Wild ideas welcome** — they spark practical ones
5. **Write everything down** — capture all variations

### 3.2 Generation Techniques

#### Technique 1: Word Mining (60-90 minutes)

Create extensive word lists from these categories:

**Functional words:** What does the product do?
```
analyze, discover, find, identify, match, connect, reveal, 
surface, detect, predict, recommend, prioritize, score, rank,
qualify, enrich, verify, validate, monitor, track, alert
```

**Benefit words:** What outcomes does it create?
```
growth, revenue, pipeline, deals, wins, success, performance,
efficiency, speed, accuracy, confidence, clarity, insight,
intelligence, advantage, edge, power, precision
```

**Emotional words:** How should users feel?
```
confident, empowered, informed, prepared, ahead, smart,
capable, equipped, supported, certain, clear, sharp,
decisive, focused, connected, aligned
```

**Domain/Industry words:** What's the context?
```
market, buyer, seller, account, prospect, lead, signal,
intent, engagement, opportunity, funnel, pipeline, deal,
revenue, quota, territory, segment, persona
```

**Metaphor sources:** What analogies apply?
```
Navigation: compass, beacon, radar, sonar, GPS, map, guide
Vision: lens, scope, prism, spotlight, clarity, focus
Speed: flash, bolt, sprint, pulse, spark, snap
Intelligence: sage, oracle, genius, savant, maven
Nature: river, flow, peak, summit, horizon
```

#### Technique 2: Linguistic Construction (45-60 minutes)

**Prefixes to try:**
```
pro-, ultra-, hyper-, meta-, omni-, multi-, uni-,
neo-, super-, mega-, alpha-, prime-, apex-, zenith-
```

**Suffixes to try:**
```
-ly, -ify, -able, -ive, -io, -ia, -us, -ix, -yx,
-ware, -works, -hub, -lab, -spot, -force, -wise
```

**Combining forms:**
```
-scope (viewing), -graph (writing), -meter (measuring),
-ology (study of), -gen (producing), -port (carrying)
```

**Construction exercises:**
1. Take 5 root words and add each prefix
2. Take 5 root words and add each suffix
3. Combine two roots (e.g., sales + force = Salesforce)
4. Blend parts of two words (e.g., pin + interest = Pinterest)

#### Technique 3: The GV "Crazy 8s" for Naming (40 minutes)

Adapted from Google Ventures Design Sprint:

1. Fold paper into 8 sections
2. Set timer for 8 minutes
3. Write one name idea in each section (1 min each)
4. Repeat 3 times = 24 names per person
5. Each person shares top 3, group dots on favorites

#### Technique 4: Analogy Exploration (30 minutes)

Complete the sentence: "This product is like _____ for _____"

Examples:
- "This is like **radar** for **sales teams**" → RadarIQ, SignalScope, Detect
- "This is like a **compass** for **revenue**" → TrueNorth, Bearing, Waypoint
- "This is like **X-ray vision** for **markets**" → Clarity, Illuminate, Reveal

#### Technique 5: Thesaurus Diving (30 minutes)

Take your top 5 concept words and explore:
1. Look up each in thesaurus
2. Look up the synonyms
3. Look up those synonyms
4. Look for unusual, evocative words that could work as names

Example chain:
```
"insight" → "perception" → "acumen" → "discernment" → "sagacity"
          → "penetration" → "foresight" → "prescience"
```

#### Technique 6: Other Languages (20 minutes)

Look up key concepts in:
- Latin (classic, professional)
- Greek (technical, scientific)
- Japanese (minimal, elegant)
- Italian (warm, expressive)
- Sanskrit (spiritual, timeless)

Example: "flow" = 
- Latin: "fluxus" → Flux
- Japanese: "nagare" → Nagare
- Greek: "roe" → Reo

#### Technique 7: Portmanteau/Blend Creation (30 minutes)

Combine two words by blending sounds:
- sales + intelligence = Salligence
- market + intelligence = Marketelligence  
- account + accuracy = Accounturacy
- prospect + perspective = Prospective
- signal + significance = Signifcance

Try different blend points:
- First word ending + second word beginning
- First syllable + last syllable
- First word + modified second word

#### Technique 8: Letter/Sound Play (20 minutes)

Explore alliteration and phonetic patterns:
- Same starting letter: Signal Suite, Revenue Radar
- Rhyming: Know Flow, Peak Seek
- Rhythm: two syllables + two syllables
- Hard consonants (k, t, p) = sharp, decisive
- Soft consonants (l, m, n) = smooth, friendly

### 3.3 Generation Session Structure

**Recommended 3-hour workshop format:**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0:00-0:15 | Review naming brief, set ground rules |
| 0:15-0:45 | Word mining (individual then share) |
| 0:45-1:15 | Linguistic construction (pairs) |
| 1:15-1:30 | Break |
| 1:30-2:00 | Crazy 8s (individual) |
| 2:00-2:30 | Analogy exploration (group) |
| 2:30-2:45 | Other languages & blends (individual) |
| 2:45-3:00 | Compile master list, identify early favorites |

### 3.4 Generation Deliverable

End generation with:
- Master list of 200+ names (no duplicates)
- Names organized by type/category
- Initial "heat" indicators (which got energy in room)
- No names eliminated yet

---

## Part 4: Phase 3 — Screening

### Purpose

Systematically reduce 200+ names to 15-20 strong candidates using objective criteria and staged filtering.

### 4.1 The Screening Funnel

```
200+ names
    │
    ▼ [Pass/Fail Filter]
~100 names
    │
    ▼ [Scoring Matrix]
~40 names
    │
    ▼ [Domain Check]
~25 names
    │
    ▼ [Preliminary TM Check]
15-20 names
```

### 4.2 Stage 1: Pass/Fail Filter

Apply these binary criteria. If any is "fail," eliminate the name.

| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Pronounceable** | Can say it correctly first try | Confusing pronunciation |
| **Spellable** | Can spell after hearing once | Multiple plausible spellings |
| **Length** | ≤3 syllables (or per brief) | Too long/unwieldy |
| **No negative meaning** | Clean in target languages | Obscene/negative in any target market |
| **Not another company** | Unique or defensible | Directly conflicts with known brand |
| **Legally viable** | No obvious TM conflict | Clearly infringes existing mark |
| **On-strategy** | Fits the brief | Contradicts positioning |

**Pro tip:** Have 2-3 people do this independently, then compare. If there's disagreement, keep the name for now.

### 4.3 Stage 2: Scoring Matrix

Score remaining names on a 1-5 scale across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | 1 (Poor) | 5 (Excellent) |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Memorability** | 20% | Forgettable, generic | Sticky, distinctive |
| **Relevance** | 20% | No connection to product | Clear connection to value |
| **Differentiation** | 15% | Sounds like competitors | Stands apart |
| **Emotional appeal** | 15% | Cold, clinical | Evokes positive feeling |
| **Extensibility** | 10% | Works for one thing only | Can grow with product line |
| **Sound/feel** | 10% | Harsh, awkward | Pleasant to say |
| **Visual potential** | 10% | Hard to logo-ify | Clear visual identity options |

**Weighted score = Σ (dimension score × weight)**

Keep names scoring 3.5+ average (or top 40, whichever is larger).

### 4.4 Stage 3: Domain Availability

For each remaining name, check:

1. **Exact .com** — is [name].com available?
2. **Variation .com** — is [name]app.com, get[name].com, [name]hq.com available?
3. **Alternative TLD** — is [name].io, [name].co, [name].ai available?
4. **Purchase price** — if taken, is it for sale? At what price?

**Domain availability tools:**
- namecheap.com/domains
- instantdomainsearch.com
- domainr.com
- afternic.com (for sale domains)

**Scoring:**
- Exact .com available: +2 points
- Good variation available: +1 point
- Only alternative TLD: 0 points
- Nothing reasonable available: -2 points

Eliminate names with no viable domain path unless brief explicitly allows this.

### 4.5 Stage 4: Preliminary Trademark Check

**Note:** This is screening, not legal clearance. Final names need proper legal review.

**DIY trademark search:**

1. **USPTO (US):** https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search
   - Search word marks for exact and similar names
   - Check relevant Nice classes (typically 9, 35, 42 for software)

2. **EUIPO (Europe):** https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/

3. **WIPO (International):** https://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/

4. **Google search:** "[name] + company/product/software"

**Red flags to eliminate:**
- Identical registered mark in same/related class
- Very similar mark with large, litigious company
- Name of well-known brand (even unregistered)

**Yellow flags (proceed with caution):**
- Similar marks in different industries
- Abandoned or cancelled registrations
- Small companies with similar marks

### 4.6 Screening Deliverable

| Rank | Name | Score | Domain Status | TM Status | Notes |
|------|------|-------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | [Name] | 4.2 | .com avail | Clear | Strong candidate |
| 2 | [Name] | 4.1 | .io avail | Caution | Check class 35 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Include 15-20 names for testing phase.

---

## Part 5: Phase 4 — Testing

### Purpose

Validate top candidates with real humans before committing. Testing prevents expensive mistakes and builds confidence.

### 5.1 Testing Dimensions

| What to Test | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Recall** | Will people remember it? |
| **Comprehension** | Do they understand what it means? |
| **Pronunciation** | Can they say it correctly? |
| **Associations** | What does it make them think of? |
| **Appeal** | Do they like it? |
| **Fit** | Does it seem right for this product? |

### 5.2 Internal Testing

#### Test 1: The Hallway Test (30 minutes)

Show 5-10 colleagues who weren't involved in naming:

1. Show name for 5 seconds, then hide
2. Ask them to write what they remember
3. Ask what the product might do
4. Ask for any associations (positive or negative)
5. Rate appeal 1-10

**Analyze:** Which names stick? Which confuse?

#### Test 2: The Phone Test (15 minutes)

Call someone (or simulate over video with audio only):

1. Say: "Have you heard of [name]?"
2. Note: Do they ask you to spell it?
3. Ask them to spell it back
4. Note: Did they get it right?

**Analyze:** Names requiring spelling explanations have friction.

#### Test 3: The Email Test (10 minutes)

Type "[name]@company.com" in an email:

1. Does it autocorrect?
2. Does it look professional?
3. Is it reasonably short?
4. Could you see this on a business card?

#### Test 4: The Noise Test (15 minutes)

In a noisy environment (coffee shop, simulate with white noise):

1. Say the name to someone
2. Can they hear it correctly?
3. Do they ask for clarification?

**Analyze:** Trade shows, sales calls, busy offices are noisy.

### 5.3 External Testing

#### Test 1: Survey Testing (1-2 days to field)

Use SurveyMonkey, Typeform, or UserTesting.com.

**Sample survey flow:**

```
SCREEN: [Demographic/firmographic questions to qualify]

Q1: Pronunciation
"How would you pronounce this word?"
[Show name, capture audio or text response]

Q2: First impression  
"What's the first thing that comes to mind when you see this name?"
[Open text]

Q3: Category guess
"What type of product do you think this might be?"
[Multiple choice: software, hardware, service, consumer product, other]

Q4: Association words
"Select all words you associate with this name"
[List of positive, negative, and neutral words]

Q5: Appeal rating
"How appealing is this name for a business software product?"
[1-7 scale]

Q6: Competitive comparison  
"Compared to these other names, which do you prefer?"
[Show 3-4 names, rank order]

Q7: Memorability
[5 minutes later in survey]
"Earlier we showed you a product name. What was it?"
[Open text]
```

**Sample size:** 50-100 responses per segment is sufficient for directional data.

#### Test 2: A/B Landing Page Test (3-5 days)

Create simple landing pages for top 2-3 names:
- Same copy, different name/logo
- Run identical ads to each
- Measure: click-through rate, time on page, email signup

**What you learn:** Which name creates more curiosity and engagement.

#### Test 3: Social Listening Check

Search each name on:
- Twitter/X
- LinkedIn
- Reddit
- Industry forums

**Ask:** Is anyone using this? What are the associations? Any baggage?

### 5.4 International Testing

If launching globally:

1. **Native speaker check:** Have native speakers in target markets review
2. **Translation meaning:** Does it mean something in other languages?
3. **Cultural associations:** Any cultural references that don't translate?
4. **Pronunciation:** Can speakers of other languages say it?

**Resources:**
- Freelance translators on Upwork
- Translation agencies
- Native-speaking employees

### 5.5 Testing Deliverable

| Name | Recall (%) | Pronunciation (%) | Appeal (1-7) | Top Associations | Red Flags |
|------|------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| [Name A] | 78% | 92% | 5.4 | Innovative, smart | None |
| [Name B] | 65% | 88% | 4.8 | Technical, cold | "B2B boring" |
| [Name C] | 82% | 71% | 5.1 | Fresh, different | Mispronounced |

Recommend top 3-5 names for final selection with evidence.

## Part 7: Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Designing by Committee

**Symptom:** 47 people have opinions, no one can agree

**Solution:** 
- Define decision rights upfront in the brief
- Limit active participants in generation to 5-8
- Use structured voting, not open debate
- One person has final decision authority

### Pitfall 2: Falling in Love Too Early

**Symptom:** CEO mentions a name in passing, it becomes the frontrunner regardless of merit

**Solution:**
- No names are "sacred" until testing complete
- Blind testing (don't reveal who suggested what)
- Data from testing beats opinion

### Pitfall 3: Optimizing for Uniqueness Over Usability

**Symptom:** Name is totally unique but no one can pronounce or spell it

**Solution:**
- Weight "spellable" and "pronounceable" heavily in screening
- Phone test and email test eliminate problems early
- If in doubt, favor clarity over cleverness

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring the URL

**Symptom:** Perfect name, but domain costs $500k or has no viable option

**Solution:**
- Check domain availability in Stage 3, before falling in love
- Have domain strategy in brief (must-have .com vs. alternatives OK)
- Budget for domain acquisition if needed

### Pitfall 5: Skipping Legal Until the End

**Symptom:** Announce name, get cease and desist letter

**Solution:**
- Preliminary TM screening in Stage 4
- Full legal clearance before final decision
- Always have a backup name ready

### Pitfall 6: Over-Describing

**Symptom:** Name tries to say everything the product does

**Solution:**
- Names should evoke, not explain
- Use tagline for description
- Short names travel further

### Pitfall 7: Naming for Today, Not Tomorrow

**Symptom:** "SalesEmailAutomator" — what happens when you add more features?

**Solution:**
- Evaluate extensibility in scoring
- Consider 3-year product roadmap
- Abstract/suggestive names age better than descriptive

### Pitfall 8: International Blind Spots

**Symptom:** Name means something embarrassing in German

**Solution:**
- Check target market languages in screening
- Native speaker review for final candidates
- Google translate is not enough

## Part 9: Speed Variations

### The 1-Week Sprint

When you don't have 5 weeks:

| Day | Focus | Output |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Mon | Discovery + Brief | Completed brief, criteria |
| Tue | Generation | 100+ names |
| Wed | Screening (Pass/Fail + Score) | Top 30 |
| Thu | Domain/TM check + Internal testing | Top 10 |
| Fri | Decision meeting | Final name |

**Trade-offs:** Skip external testing, preliminary legal only, less validation

### The 1-Day Emergency

When it needs to happen now:

**Morning (4 hours):**
- 30 min: Quick brief (positioning, must-haves, constraints)
- 90 min: Rapid generation (Crazy 8s × 3 rounds)
- 60 min: Quick filtering (gut check + domain check)
- 60 min: Top 5 debate and selection

**Afternoon (2 hours):**
- Domain registration
- Basic TM search
- Social handle reservation

**Trade-offs:** High risk, no testing, gut-driven, plan for possible rename later

## Part 10: B2B Product Naming Considerations

### B2B vs. B2C Differences

| Factor | B2C | B2B |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Memorability | Critical | Important |
| Professionalism | Varies | Essential |
| Descriptiveness | Less important | More valued |
| Buying committee | 1 person | Multiple stakeholders |
| Name volume | Fewer products | Product line complexity |

### B2B Naming Architecture

**Platform name:** The core platform brand (e.g., ZoomInfo)

**Product line names:** Major product categories
- Option A: Descriptive (ZoomInfo Sales, ZoomInfo Marketing)
- Option B: Branded (ZoomInfo [Name], ZoomInfo [Name])

**Feature names:** Individual capabilities
- Usually descriptive
- Tied to product line
- e.g., "Buyer Intent," "Company Attributes"

**Best practice:** Keep platform and product names investable; keep feature names descriptive.

### B2B Testing Considerations

- Test with actual buyers in ICP
- Test with economic buyers AND users (often different)
- Test in context of existing product portfolio
- Test name + tagline together

## Conclusion: The Naming Mindset

Good product naming is not magic. It's a process.

**Remember:**

1. **Start with strategy, not syllables.** The brief determines success more than the brainstorm.

2. **Quantity enables quality.** Generate many names to find the right one.

3. **Test with humans.** Your opinion is not data.

4. **Secure what you choose.** Domain, trademark, handles.

5. **Document decisions.** Future you will thank present you.

6. **A good name is the beginning.** The product makes the name great, not the reverse.
