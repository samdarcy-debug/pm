# GTM Flow: Internal Positioning Memo

## Executive Summary

GTM Flow is a positioning shift that reframes ZoomInfo from a data provider to the intelligence foundation for go-to-market. This is not a new product or SKU—it's an elevation of our existing Intelligence layer to the center of our platform narrative.

The core thesis: In an agentic world, ZoomInfo's durable value isn't data or tools—it's the intelligence that GTM execution runs on.

## The Market Context

Three shifts are driving this repositioning:

1. **AI doesn't win with raw data—it wins with contextual, connected intelligence.** Foundation models are commoditizing. The differentiation is in the specialized context layer.

2. **GTM execution now depends on intelligence that understands accounts, buyers, timing, and intent.** Generic LLMs can't do this well. Purpose-built systems can.

3. **AI compresses seats, headcount, and traditional per-license models.** Intelligence scales by usage, decisions, and outcomes—not users.


## What GTM Flow Is

**GTM Flow is:**
- The intelligence layer the GTM Intelligence Platform runs on
- A set of purpose-built GTM AI models that sit on top of foundation LLMs (Claude, Gemini, etc.) and apply ZoomInfo-specific context, logic, and learning
- Accessed through ZoomInfo products (Workspace, Studio, MCP/API)
- Monetized through Credits (data and AI Action)—value scales with execution, not seats

**GTM Flow is not:**
- A standalone product or SKU
- A general-purpose LLM competing with Claude or Gemini
- A headless data product
- Seat-based software

## Why This Matters Commercially

The commercial logic is defensive and offensive:

**Defensive:** AI is compressing traditional software economics. Seat-based pricing erodes as agents replace human workflows. By anchoring value in intelligence rather than seats, we future-proof revenue.

**Offensive:** We capture value wherever GTM happens—inside or outside our UI. Every agent, every workflow, every decision that touches GTM can run on our intelligence layer.

**Evidence:** We win more deals when customers understand and adopt our Intelligence layer. Not because we have more data or more tools—but because context is the differentiator competitors struggle to replicate.

## The Build vs. Buy Argument

(Borrowed framing from Intercom's Finn launch)

The counter-narrative to "companies will build their own AI":

GTM Flow is the product of extensive experimentation, multiple LLMs connected together, proprietary components, and significant engineering investment. You're not building that on the side. The same way Intercom's Finn took 100+ experiments, 7 LLMs, patented components, and 130+ engineers to move resolution rates from the high 20s to approaching 50%—GTM intelligence at this level isn't a side project.

## Go-to-Market Plan

**Launch Type:** Tier 1 Product Launch

**Objective:** Drive pipeline growth, competitive win rates, and AI Action Credit consumption.

### Workstream Ownership

| Function | Lift | Responsibilities |
|----------|------|------------------|
| **Product** | Moderate | Update platform narrative, drive naming, update pitch decks, partner on Marketing/Sales planning. Product teams continue shipping existing Intelligence-first roadmap. |
| **Marketing** | Heavy | Primary owner. Full Tier 1 launch: press release, campaigns, event presence, web update, social. Re-establish market understanding of ZoomInfo as "the AI and intelligence company." |
| **Sales/Revenue** | Moderate-Heavy | Reinforce updated platform narrative, arm sellers with clearer differentiation story, enable on intelligence-first positioning vs. ChatGPT, Claude, Glean, Clay, Gong. |

### Timeline

- **December–January:** Narrative, Messaging, Naming finalization
- **January 21:** Internal Launch at RKO
- **January–February:** Sales & Marketing Readiness
- **Date TBD:** Market Launch Day

### ELT Approvals Needed

1. Proposal sign-off (Henry, James, Tal, Dominik)
2. Marketing launch strategy (DAI: Tal)
3. Sales readiness strategy (DAI: James)
4. Sales & Marketing aligned timeline (DAI: Tal & James)


## Competitive Positioning

GTM Flow positions us against a new competitive set:

| Competitor | Our Differentiation |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Generic LLMs** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) | They lack GTM context. We have 100M companies, 500M contacts, behavioral signals, and proprietary GTM logic baked in. |
| **Horizontal AI tools** (Glean) | They search your data. We provide intelligence purpose-built for GTM decisions. |
| **Point solutions** (Clay, Gong) | They do one thing. We're the intelligence layer that powers the full GTM workflow. |
| **DIY approaches** | See build vs. buy argument above. |

## Open Questions

1. **Naming:** Is "GTM Flow" the final name? What alternatives have been considered?
2. **Pricing model:** How do AI Action Credits map to specific GTM Flow capabilities?
3. **Competitive benchmarking:** Do we have GTMBench results ready for launch?
4. **Customer proof points:** Which customers best demonstrate the intelligence advantage?


## Next Steps

1. ELT alignment on proposal (done?)
2. Finalize naming decision
3. Develop sales enablement materials
4. Build competitive battle cards for new positioning
5. Identify launch customers for case studies
