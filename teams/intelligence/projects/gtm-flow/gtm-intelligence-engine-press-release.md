# Press Release: GTM Intelligence Engine

## ZoomInfo Unveils GTM Intelligence Engine, the Context Foundation for AI-Powered Go-to-Market

*New intelligence layer unifies data on 100M+ companies and 500M+ contacts with federated and fine-tuned AI models to solve the context problem that breaks enterprise GTM*

**VANCOUVER, WA** — ZoomInfo today announced GTM Intelligence Engine, the unified data, context and AI layer for the next generation of AI-powered go-to-market.

Enterprise GTM stacks have become fragmented. The average company runs more than 40 tools: one for calls, another for sequences, another for intent signals. Each captures a slice of context. Each stores it in its own database. Each syncs partial data back to the CRM. The result is siloed information that cannot support the AI systems companies are racing to deploy.

GTM Intelligence Engine solves this problem. It combines ZoomInfo's proprietary data on more than 100 million companies and 500 million professional contacts with entity resolution infrastructure, semantic normalization, and federated and fine-tuned AI models designed specifically for go-to-market execution. The system transforms scattered, inconsistent GTM data into machine-readable context that AI can actually use.

"CRM is not going to be the platform companies run GTM AI on," said Henry Schuck, Founder and CEO of ZoomInfo. "The data model is 25 years old. It captures snapshots of deal state but not the decision trace: what was tried, what worked, why things moved. GTM Intelligence Engine provides the context foundation that makes AI effective for revenue teams."

### The Problem: Why General-Purpose AI Falls Short

Foundation models have remarkable general capabilities. They also fail predictably when applied to enterprise GTM. The reason is structural: these models lack the context that determines revenue outcomes.

Consider a deal in your pipeline. The CRM shows: stage changed, close date pushed, amount revised. That is what the system captured. What actually happened: a CFO joined a call and asked about ROI (that is why the deal accelerated), a champion went quiet for eight days fighting an internal budget battle (that is why it almost stalled), and competitive pressure drove a discount. CRMs record state changes. AI needs the causal chain: events linked to context linked to patterns.

Point solutions cannot provide this. Your call recording platform has transcripts but cannot tell you that a procurement contact entering at an unusual stage correlates with longer negotiation cycles. Your sequencing tool tracks outreach but cannot tell you why a champion went quiet. Each tool captures raw data. None capture the causal chain that explains outcomes.

GTM Intelligence Engine captures and connects this context across every system in the GTM stack.

### The Data Foundation Problem

Before AI can reason about GTM, the underlying data must be unified and resolved. This is harder than it sounds.

Most CRMs contain duplicate records for the same company under different names, abbreviations, and divisions. Contacts appear with variations across systems. Job titles change but only one database reflects the update. Subsidiary relationships are inconsistent. The same person, the same company, the same opportunity exists in multiple places with conflicting information.

GTM Intelligence Engine addresses this through four integrated components:

**B2B Grounding Data.** The grounding world model for the B2B landscape. ZoomInfo's foundation: the largest B2B data asset in the world, covering companies, contacts, and signals with attribute-level confidence scoring. This is the truth layer that AI reasons against.

**Unified Data and Matching Engine.** Entity resolution at scale, matching and deduping across first-party and third-party sources. The system resolves billions of entities across every variation, misspelling, abbreviation, and format into a single entity graph. This is years of specialized infrastructure, not a feature bolted onto existing systems.

**GTM Context Graph.** The context layer that sits above the data foundation and unifies signals across systems. It connects entities, relationships, and patterns in machine-readable form. When a buyer mentions needing to involve another department on a call, the system extracts: new stakeholder entering, stage change likely, risk profile updated. The graph contextualizes GTM entities (buying groups, meetings, stages) with meaning, history, and pattern data.

**AI Models and Agents.** Federated and fine-tuned models for high-value go-to-market jobs: account prioritization, next best action, buyer research, deal momentum scoring. These models and agents apply ZoomInfo-specific context and best practices on top of foundation models, executing GTM work the way top performers do it.

### Capabilities

GTM Intelligence Engine powers intelligent execution across the complete revenue lifecycle:

**Account and Buyer Research.** Contextualized insights on target accounts and decision-makers that go beyond firmographic data. The system connects first-party engagement history with third-party signals to surface what matters before every interaction.

**Pipeline Generation.** AI-driven identification of high-fit prospects based on analysis of fit, intent, and timing signals. The system continuously surfaces accounts actively researching solutions, improving pipeline quality by focusing seller attention on opportunities most likely to convert.

**Propensity-to-Buy Scoring.** Synthesis of hundreds of predictive signals to identify accounts demonstrating purchase likelihood, helping revenue teams prioritize outreach and allocate resources to highest-impact opportunities.

**Next Best Action.** Contextually aware guidance on how, when, and through which channels to engage each prospect. Recommendations incorporate pattern matching across similar accounts and buyer personas.

**Risk Assessment and Deal Intelligence.** Real-time monitoring of deal health and customer relationships. The system surfaces early warning signals and provides the context behind each signal, enabling intervention before opportunities stall.

**Contextual Content Generation.** Messaging tailored to specific buyers at specific moments, generated from deep understanding of each account's situation and priorities.

### Access and Commercial Model

GTM Intelligence Engine is accessible through multiple surfaces:

**ZoomInfo Workspace** serves frontline sellers with an intelligent interface for daily prospecting, research, and engagement.

**ZoomInfo Studio** enables revenue operations and marketing teams to orchestrate multi-channel GTM plays powered by unified intelligence.

**MCP and API access** allows technical teams to embed GTM intelligence directly into custom applications, internal tools, and partner integrations. Available as an integration in Claude, ChatGPT, and anywhere that supports MCP.

GTM Intelligence Engine value scales through AI Credits, a consumption model that aligns cost with actual usage and business outcomes rather than headcount. Customers capture value whether intelligence is consumed by human users, automated workflows, or AI agents.

### Build vs. Buy

ZoomInfo invests more than $250 million annually in data acquisition and normalization. The company spends over $1 million per month on AI inference alone, running continuous experimentation to improve model performance across GTM use cases. GTM Intelligence Engine is the product of 20 years building the largest B2B data unification platform in the world.

Effective GTM intelligence requires entity resolution at scale, semantic normalization, hierarchy and relationship management, and first-party/third-party unification. This is not a capability developed as a side project or replicated with a small internal team.

### Availability

GTM Intelligence Engine is available now to ZoomInfo customers as an integrated capability of the GTM Intelligence Platform. Existing customers can contact their account team to access GTM Intelligence Engine capabilities. Prospective customers can request a demonstration at www.zoominfo.com.
