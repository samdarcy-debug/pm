# **Context Engineering Team Executive Roundup**

## **Executive Summary**

The team advanced two foundational infrastructure initiatives this week.
Sri completed analysis showing 18 of 24 missing raw signals can be
enabled through disaggregation and existing data, while Robyn\'s APS
integration work is blocked pending stakeholder alignment with Lars and
Ryan on use cases and integration approach.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Sri completed comprehensive analysis of the workbook signals gap,
identifying a clear path to enable 75% of missing raw signals through
scoops disaggregation and existing solar data. This analysis provides
concrete requirements and prioritization for closing the functionality
gap between insights and raw signals.

Robyn advanced MCP to APS integration work to 90% completion, with the
underlying API infrastructure already available and ready for deployment
pending stakeholder review.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Workbook Raw Signals**: Sri analyzed all 24 missing raw signals,
categorizing 13 as achievable through scoops disaggregation, 5 through
existing solar data integration, and 6 as unsuitable for raw signal
implementation. Requirements documentation is complete, with timeline
discussions scheduled for mid-next week.

**APS Integration**: Robyn progressed MCP integration to 90% completion
but encountered a blocker when Ryan rejected the current MCP approach.
The underlying APS API is production-ready, requiring alignment on use
cases and integration patterns before proceeding.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The APS integration is stalled pending stakeholder alignment between
Robyn, Lars, and Ryan on integration touchpoints and use case
validation. While the technical work is largely complete, the
integration approach needs executive review before deployment can
proceed.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on unblocking both initiatives. Sri will finalize
timelines with the workbooks team for raw signals implementation, while
Robyn will meet with Lars and Ryan to resolve the APS integration
approach. Additionally, Robyn will begin LangSmith exploration and
product hierarchy analysis to support broader agentic capabilities.
