Data Executive Roundup - [September
22nd, 2025 - September 25th, 2025]

Executive Summary

Bottom Line: FINRA data ingestion completed successfully into Snowflake with full QA
validation, marking another major vertical dataset win, while DevOps blockers continue to delay
POI production deployment despite having staging-ready code. Igor Kyrylenko delivered the
complete FINRA financial services dataset with 900,000+ individual brokers and 40,000+
companies, providing immediate sales enablement opportunities for fintech prospects. However,
Steve Hutchinson's user-level POI deployment remains stalled by infrastructure approvals,
creating downstream delays for agent development and GTM Studio functionality that teams are
depending on for Q4 initiatives.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Igor Kyrylenko successfully completed FINRA data ingestion into Snowflake, delivering a
comprehensive financial services dataset containing over 900,000 individual brokers and
40,000+ investment companies with complete hierarchy, employment history, certifications, and
disciplinary records. This government-sourced dataset provides immediate differentiation in the
fintech market and represents solid progress on our vertical dataset expansion goals. Igor also
advanced franchise data processing with improved multi-brand owner coverage through
AI-generated contact enhancement, strengthening the dataset's commercial value.

Dow Jones drove meaningful end-of-quarter support for key opportunities while maintaining
focus on vertical dataset rollout, achieving approximately 80% completion on updated account
targets despite GTM leadership availability constraints during quarter-end activities. The GTM.AI
site launch represents a significant milestone in our data marketplace strategy, creating a
public-facing demonstration of our custom dataset capabilities. Strategic customer engagement
on insurance producers dataset shows strong demand alignment with our vertical expansion
strategy.

Dana Hurtig delivered substantial data quality improvements with over 1 million enrichments
completed at 87% of target and 668,400 data fixes at 133% of target, while successfully
advancing the second batch of Rhetorik EMEA data through staging with approximately 500,000
records ready for production review. The team's consistent execution on coverage and quality
metrics demonstrates operational excellence in data operations, with additional progress on
board of directors and executive leadership team data preparation for customer deliverables.

Goals & Progress

Vertical Datasets: FINRA data successfully ingested into Snowflake with complete schema
documentation and QA validation, while franchise dataset automation advances with record
disposition tracking now implemented across the processing workflow. Igor Kyrylenko expanded
multi-brand owner coverage through targeted research and AI-generated contact matching,
improving dataset commercial viability. Eight new vertical dataset projects identified and
prioritized for the next two months, ranging from straightforward FDIC bank data to complex
automotive dealership scraping initiatives.

GTM Infrastructure: Account targets updated to reflect territory changes and new hire
alignments, though full GTM leadership engagement remains challenging during quarter-end
period. Dow Jones focused support on key end-of-quarter opportunities where vertical datasets
could accelerate deal closure, demonstrating immediate revenue impact potential. Insurance
producers dataset generated strong customer interest during strategic presentations, indicating
market readiness for specialized vertical offerings.

Data Quality & Coverage: Comprehensive data enrichment programs delivered over 1 million
mobile phone and email updates, while systematic cleanup addressed over 650,000 data
consistency issues across contact and company records. Dana Hurtig's team maintained high
execution standards on international company expansion, with EMEA data processing reaching
final review stages. Board of directors and executive leadership data preparation completed on
schedule for October customer deliverable requirements.

Strategic Challenges

DevOps infrastructure blockers continue preventing POI production deployment despite having
staging-ready code and completed development work, creating cascading delays for
downstream agent development and GTM Studio functionality that multiple teams require for Q4
initiatives. Steve Hutchinson has technical solutions prepared but remains dependent on
infrastructure approvals that have extended beyond expected timelines. While development
continues on additional interest types in parallel, the production deployment bottleneck risks
impacting agent-powered features that sales teams are expecting for renewal cycles.

GTM leadership availability during quarter-end activities limited progress on vertical dataset
enablement and account target rollout, though underlying demand signals remain strong as
evidenced by customer presentations and strategic opportunity support. Dow Jones balanced
immediate quarter-end support with longer-term dataset development, but noted the ongoing
need for dedicated GTM engagement to achieve scale across territory management and
dataset utilization. The timing challenge highlights the importance of establishing sustainable
enablement processes that can operate independently during high-activity periods.
Brandon Wilson encountered data consistency issues with contributory network benchmark
queries, requiring additional tenant validation work and stage name normalization to ensure
reliable dataset aggregation for board presentation requirements. While statistical approaches
and normalization logic have been developed to address the challenges, the complexity of
opportunity data standardization across multiple tenant configurations requires ongoing
refinement to deliver consistent insights for executive reporting.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

Email notification infrastructure analysis revealed significant optimization opportunities, with
Jody Roberts' team discovering that a substantial percentage of notifications target regions
without regulatory requirements, creating unnecessary processing overhead and potential
compliance risks. The team developed a clear path forward to prioritize EU and Canada
notifications while establishing long-term email competency improvements. This discovery
demonstrates how regulatory compliance analysis can drive both operational efficiency and risk
reduction across data processing workflows.

FINRA dataset completion validated our approach to government data acquisition and
processing, with Igor Kyrylenko successfully navigating complex hierarchy relationships and
regulatory data requirements to deliver a production-ready vertical dataset. The 900,000+
individual broker records with complete employment histories and disciplinary actions represent
a unique competitive differentiator that traditional data providers cannot easily replicate. This
success provides a proven methodology for approaching additional government data sources
and specialized industry datasets.

GTM.AI site launch and customer response patterns revealed strong market appetite for
transparent data marketplace experiences, with early engagement suggesting customers value
direct access to dataset samples and technical specifications. Dow Jones observed that
customer presentations using the vertical dataset framework created significantly more
productive discovery conversations and clearer value articulation. This learning supports
continued investment in self-service evaluation tools and customer-facing data transparency
initiatives.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with DevOps on POI production deployment remains the primary infrastructure
dependency blocking multiple downstream initiatives across agent development, GTM Studio
functionality, and user-level interest targeting capabilities. Steve Hutchinson continues
coordinating with infrastructure teams to resolve configuration requirements, with escalation
paths identified if delays extend into next week. Clear resolution of this dependency is
necessary for maintaining development velocity on Q4 agent-powered features that sales teams
are expecting for renewal cycles.
The second batch of Rhetorik EMEA data processing requires coordination with web data
acquisition teams for crawling and vitality assessment before final production deployment,
representing a successful example of cross-functional collaboration on international data
expansion. Dana Hurtig has established clear handoff procedures and quality validation
checkpoints to ensure smooth processing of the 500,000-record batch. This collaboration model
demonstrates effective resource sharing for complex data processing initiatives while
maintaining quality standards.

Looking Ahead

Next week focuses on production deployment breakthroughs and dataset commercialization
acceleration, with particular emphasis on resolving infrastructure blockers that are preventing
multiple teams from advancing their Q4 deliverables. The combination of completed vertical
datasets awaiting go-to-market support and staging-ready technical capabilities suggests
significant value unlock potential once deployment obstacles are cleared.
