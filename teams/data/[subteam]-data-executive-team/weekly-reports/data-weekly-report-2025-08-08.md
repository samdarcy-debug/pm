Data Executive Roundup - [August 4th -
August 7th, 2025]

Executive Summary

We're positioned to deliver $10M+ in vertical dataset revenue with strong execution
momentum, but need immediate focus on go-to-market enablement over new dataset
development. The team validated feasibility of the $10M goal through named account mapping,
with sufficient high-value customers already identified who can consume data in bulk. However,
go-to-market operationalization and sales team enablement represent bigger execution risks
than data processing capabilities at this stage.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Brandon Tucker and Dow Jones achieved 70-75% completion on vertical dataset tactical
planning, confirming the $10M revenue target is realistic through account-to-dataset mapping
analysis. The focus has appropriately shifted from pure dataset creation to actionable revenue
generation with named accounts identified for each vertical.

Steve Hutchinson completed 100% of his contact recommender integration planning,
establishing a clear path to increase person-level signals by 24% for Copilot users. The Data
Science team confirmed viability of integrating Contact Recommender with User Level POI,
creating a scalable foundation for more relevant signal generation.

Dana Hurtig delivered 80% completion on Latin America data expansion, successfully
processing 200K contact bio updates using AI, deduping 250K mobile phones, and removing
100K junk VP+ contacts. The 1.1M Rhetorik company infusion is progressing through DIP
platform with 1.4M associated contacts queued for follow-up processing.

Goals & Progress

Data Quality & Infrastructure: Rob Priore achieved 100% completion of the ZI Lite ingestion
audit, confirming blocking workflows function correctly while identifying a legal risk around
stored but unused data that requires deletion. CN logic errors from April have been resolved,
and cookie loading issues have been escalated to Google engineering for resolution.

Signal Enhancement: Brandon Wilson reached 60% completion on New Rep signal
development, incorporating valuable feedback on the Won Deal Similar Account signal that
significantly improved data usage and generation approach. The semantic data integration
continues to show promise for enhancing signal relevance and reducing latency.

Agent Development: Jody Roberts made 50% progress on agent prototypes despite platform
adoption challenges, focusing on org chart visualization within the agentic framework. The team
identified significant opportunities for analysis agents to address ongoing data discoverability
and documentation blockers.

Strategic Challenges

Go-to-market enablement represents our highest execution risk for vertical datasets.
While data processing capabilities are solid, operationalizing sales team support, creating
compelling customer-facing materials, and building subject matter expertise across diverse
verticals requires significant investment. The team needs dedicated focus on enablement and
customer success rather than continued dataset expansion.

Data discoverability and documentation continue to constrain analysis productivity
across the organization. Multiple team members cited this as a blocker during the AI
hackathon, indicating broader organizational impact. The promising agent prototypes for
analysis assistance need acceleration and broader deployment to address this systemic issue.

Legal and compliance workflows require ongoing attention with increasing customer
scrutiny. Microsoft flagging Swapper.exe as malware has created customer concerns about
data sharing, while California/Oregon opt-out processes need workflow updates to balance
compliance with fraud prevention.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

The vertical dataset opportunity extends far beyond initial projections when coupled with
proper account targeting. Analysis revealed sufficient high-value customers already in the
pipeline who can consume data in bulk, with strong inbound interest across multiple verticals.
The constraint is execution capacity, not market demand.

Customer behavior is shifting toward AI-driven data discovery, creating competitive
pressure on our platform experience. When customers can't find company information in
ZoomInfo, they're defaulting to ChatGPT for basic research. We need research agents that
provide comprehensive company/contact profiles on-demand to maintain user engagement and
platform stickiness.

Subject matter expertise development is becoming more critical than pure process
automation for vertical datasets. Unlike core data where scalable processes work well,
vertical datasets require deep understanding of industry nuances, regulatory environments, and
state-by-state variations that can't be easily automated.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with the Data Science team on Contact Recommender integration is proceeding
smoothly with clear technical alignment on User Level POI architecture. The 24% signal lift
potential creates compelling value for Copilot v2 development timelines.

Platform team collaboration on agentic framework development needs acceleration to address
analysis workflow bottlenecks. The authentication and integration challenges are limiting our
ability to deploy promising agent prototypes that could significantly improve team productivity.

Looking Ahead

Next week's primary focus shifts from dataset development to revenue execution,
emphasizing go-to-market readiness and sales enablement for existing vertical offerings.

The team will prioritize named account conversations with account managers, building
customer-facing materials that clearly articulate vertical dataset value, and developing the
subject matter expertise needed to support complex deals. Dana's work on contractor and
franchise data syncing will continue, while Steve advances User Level POI development with
Data Science team integration. Rob will focus on resolving cookie loading issues with Google
engineering and advancing the ZI Lite data deletion process.

Most importantly, we're implementing a research data agent to address the competitive threat
from ChatGPT-style interactions, ensuring ZoomInfo remains the first destination for company
and contact research rather than losing users to external AI tools.
