Data Executive Roundup - [August 11th -
August 14th, 2025]

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Vertical Dataset Market Validation Exceeded Expectations: Dow Jones completed account
mapping across all priority datasets, identifying restaurant (qualified accounts), contractor
(OSHA violation interest confirmed), and franchise opportunities with high-confidence revenue
potential in H2. Brandon Tucker's conversation with Mastercard confirmed strong interest in
franchise cube and restaurant data, demonstrating that market demand exists at the enterprise
level without additional education required.

Chorus Email Signature Breakthrough Identified: Rob Priore discovered ZoomInfo captures
2 million full email signatures monthly from Chorus but currently uses only IP2ORG data. Legal
approval obtained for expanding usage to email deliverability capabilities, with potential for
company matching tile integration. This represents a significant incremental data enhancement
opportunity requiring minimal technical investment.

Lost Deal Signal Architecture Completed: Steve Hutchinson finalized definitions for Lost
Deals and Dormant Accounts, enabling priority accounts pipeline integration. The foundation
now exists to surface funding rounds, C-suite changes, and other re-engagement signals for
accounts that previously fell off radar. David Golden's involvement ensures cross-functional
alignment on implementation approach.

Goals & Progress

Multi-Agent Coordination Breakthrough: Ethan Young successfully tested coordination
between multiple AI agents for data catalog creation and query generation, achieving
streamlined analysis workflows that reduce manual data discovery overhead. The confluence
space documentation shows promising early results, though Snowflake and BigQuery access
limitations through ZI Chat create implementation dependencies.

Latin America Company Expansion Progressing: Dana Hurtig continued ramping company
DIP processes with 226,000 companies completed and additional 180,000 queued. URL
validation uncovered quality issues (43% inactive URLs), requiring deeper analysis to
distinguish between genuinely invalid companies versus viable businesses without functional
websites, particularly in Brazilian market segments.
Org Chart Agent Development: Jody Roberts made progress toward working prototype
deadline, though GAL data connectivity to agentic platform remains a technical blocker requiring
engineering support. The roadmap artifact preparation for Tuesday sharing with desk team is on
track for Monday completion.

Strategic Challenges

Resource Allocation Creating Execution Bottlenecks: Multiple team members are operating
at 50-70% goal completion rates due to competing priorities rather than technical limitations.
Brandon Wilson's signal generation work, Dana Hurtig's data quality improvements, and Jody
Roberts' agentic platform exploration are all valuable initiatives that require dedicated focus to
achieve excellence rather than acceptable outcomes.

Data Platform Integration Dependencies: Ethan Young identified significant limitations with ZI
Chat's current architecture for data team workflows, specifically the lack of direct Snowflake and
BigQuery access. The semantic layer abstraction approach conflicts with the team's need for
direct query capabilities, potentially requiring pushback against standard data access
restrictions to unlock agentic solutions.

Cross-Functional Coordination Gaps: The team's work on contributory network data
ingestion, website key buyer ID requirements, and partnership integration processes reveals
systematic challenges in aligning legal, security, and engineering stakeholders around data
initiatives. These coordination gaps consume disproportionate time relative to technical
complexity of the work itself.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

Vertical Dataset Demand Validation Changes Go-to-Market Strategy: Customer
conversations consistently demonstrate that vertical datasets address existing pain points rather
than requiring market education. The shift from "here's a new capability" to "here's the data
you've been asking for" fundamentally changes sales approach, timeline expectations, and
pricing discussions. This validation supports aggressive H2 revenue targets.

AI Agent Orchestration Shows Production Readiness: Ethan Young's multi-agent
coordination testing demonstrates that current AI capabilities can handle complex data analysis
workflows beyond simple query generation. The data catalog agent combined with analysis
agent approach could significantly reduce time-to-insight for routine data investigations, though
infrastructure access remains a limiting factor.

Email Signature Data Represents Massive Untapped Asset: Rob Priore's discovery that
ZoomInfo already captures 2 million monthly email signatures from Chorus without full utilization
reveals systematic gaps in data asset leverage. Legal approval for expanded usage suggests
similar opportunities may exist across other integrated tools and platforms.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with the GTM team on vertical dataset prioritization continues to be critical for H2
revenue execution. Brandon Tucker and Dow Jones have established clear communication
channels with R&G leadership, though the validation process requires ongoing account
manager engagement to convert interest into active opportunities.

The Snowflake access limitation for agentic platform development creates dependencies on
data platform team decisions that could impact multiple AI agent initiatives. Ethan Young's
needs for direct query access may require executive support to override standard data access
protocols.

Looking Ahead

September Focus Must Prioritize Revenue-Generating Activities: The team has validated
multiple high-value opportunities but needs disciplined focus on execution over exploration.
Vertical dataset samples and evaluation support should take precedence over new data source
integrations or experimental AI workflows until H2 revenue commitments are secured.

Agentic Platform Development Requires Infrastructure Decisions: The promising results
from multi-agent coordination testing demand resolution of data access limitations and platform
connectivity issues. Executive decision-making needed on whether to invest in workaround
solutions or push for systematic platform improvements that benefit multiple teams.

Cross-Functional Alignment Becomes Execution Enabler: The team's technical capabilities
consistently exceed organizational coordination speed. Establishing clearer decision-making
processes for legal approvals, security reviews, and engineering prioritization would unlock
significantly more value from existing team capacity than additional headcount or technical
tools.
