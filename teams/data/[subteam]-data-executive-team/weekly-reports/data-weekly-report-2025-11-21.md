# Core Data Executive Roundup - Week of November 17-21, 2025

## Executive Summary

Magnus Herweyer secured a specialized vendor solution for delivering the
remaining 5 million Canadian privacy notices after encountering Spamhaus
blocking across ZoomInfo domains, investing to ensure compliance by
month-end. Rituparna Das provided comprehensive data analysis supporting
the offsite\'s waterfall enrichment strategy discussions aimed at
enhancing competitive positioning, while Peter Overman advanced
leadership data product design with engineering teams and Heather Ma
coordinated opportunity data normalization efforts essential for Deal
Insights Agent capabilities.

## This Week\'s Progress

### Key Momentum Areas

Magnus Herweyer identified an innovative path forward for Canadian
privacy notice delivery by partnering with Puresend, a vendor
specializing in difficult email delivery scenarios. This strategic
investment addresses the Spamhaus blocking situation while the team
awaits response from Act-On. Expected delivery of 3-4 million emails
from the 5 million batch accounts for anticipated bounce rates on these
addresses, moving the initiative toward completion.

Rituparna Das made solid progress on leadership data product design,
coordinating with Andrew\'s engineering team for draft review this week
to finalize implementation specifications. His parallel investigation
into contact availability patterns for Capital One and SimilarWeb
revealed connections to recent local address field updates, providing
valuable insights for data quality improvements.

Heather Ma successfully advanced GTM Store capabilities by initiating
knowledge transfer to Andy and Austin from the research team on dataset
integration processes. The analysis of untapped company sources yielded
promising results with 15 million potential candidates identified from
73 million records processed, while Rene\'s central domain repository
development promises enhanced web data collection management.

### Goals & Progress

**Email Platform Enhancement**: Magnus Herweyer balanced immediate
Canadian notification delivery with strategic threat detection shared
service development. The threat detection initiative will provide
white-label Impressionwise capabilities for GTM Studio\'s AI data
management offering and NeverBounce.com, creating new revenue
opportunities while strengthening email quality controls.

**Waterfall Enrichment Implementation**: John Durst prepared
comprehensive source groupings and alternate value analyses for email,
mobile, and direct phone attributes, enabling smooth offsite discussions
on waterfall enrichment strategies. This preparation ensures data teams
can provide real-time support during strategic planning sessions focused
on coverage optimization.

**Data Normalization Advancement**: Heather Ma progressed opportunity
data normalization discussions across multiple teams, focusing on
account type, opportunity stage, and opportunity type fields essential
for Deal Insights Agent functionality. Coordination with Magnus, Casey,
Mark, Linda, and Andres teams continues to clarify implementation
approaches and timelines.

### Strategic Challenges

**Email Delivery Optimization**: The Spamhaus blocking situation
presents an opportunity to evaluate and enhance email delivery
infrastructure. The team\'s creative approach with specialized vendors
demonstrates adaptability while working toward the November 30th
completion target for Canadian notifications.

**Cross-Functional Coordination**: The opportunity normalization project
involves multiple stakeholders across data, engineering, and product
teams. Heather Ma and Magnus are working to establish clear
communication channels and decision-making processes, with Casey\'s
involvement helping to align technical implementation with business
requirements.

**Data Source Evolution**: The upcoming Sever deprecation creates
opportunity to diversify PII data sources. Heather Ma\'s exploration of
calendar participant data and email signatures represents proactive
planning for data continuity, with integration team collaboration
opening new possibilities for data acquisition.

## Strategic Insights

### Key Learnings & Discoveries

The team\'s strategic vendor partnership for email delivery demonstrates
effective problem-solving when traditional channels face limitations.
This approach, while requiring investment, ensures compliance objectives
are met while the team develops longer-term email infrastructure
improvements.

Rituparna's analysis linking contact availability to local address
changes in DaaS cubes provides valuable insight into data model
dependencies. The discovery on CN seed records contributing to local
address removal necessitates more informed decision-making for future
field updates and helps optimize data quality for enterprise customers.

The 20% conversion rate from orphan/predict leads analysis validates the
opportunity within existing data assets. Heather Ma\'s work uncovering
15 million company candidates from previously unstructured sources
demonstrates the value of systematic data mining initiatives.

### Cross-Team Dependencies

Opportunity normalization efforts benefit from involvement across
multiple teams, with Heather Ma coordinating between data, engineering,
and product stakeholders. The collaborative approach ensures
comprehensive requirements gathering while Casey provides technical
architecture guidance.

Tuesday\'s admin portal data sharing release represents a coordinated
effort between product and support teams, with anticipated customer
inquiries providing valuable feedback for future iterations. Integration
team collaboration on both this release and email signature capabilities
demonstrates effective partnership models.

## Looking Ahead

Next week focuses on executing the Puresend vendor engagement for
Canadian privacy notice completion while Magnus secures budget approval
with Brandon. The offsite sessions will benefit from Rituparna\'s
comprehensive data preparation, enabling informed decisions on waterfall
enrichment strategies that enhance competitive positioning.

Peter Overman will complete the leadership data product design review
with engineering teams while delivering insights on contact availability
patterns to improve customer data quality. Heather Ma manages the admin
portal release while advancing opportunity normalization discussions and
progressing the promising orphan company analysis toward publication.

The convergence of compliance initiatives, strategic planning sessions,
and customer-facing releases creates an exciting week of progress across
multiple fronts, with the team well-positioned to deliver value through
coordinated execution and strategic innovation.
