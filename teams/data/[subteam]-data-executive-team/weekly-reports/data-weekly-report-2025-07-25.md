Data Team Executive Roundup - Monday
July 21st - Thursday July 24th

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Rob Priore completed a comprehensive business plan outline for our email deliverability
product, positioning us to monetize our abuse desk expertise as an outsourced service for
customers. This represents a genuine new revenue channel that leverages our unique data
position to help customers avoid spam folder issues - a critical pain point when using our data at
scale.

Dana Hurtig's team achieved breakthrough operational efficiency with 5x productivity
gains on conference automation, effectively eliminating nearly 2 FTE worth of manual work
while simultaneously cleaning 160,000 junk executive profiles from top 500 companies. The
mobile phone infusion from Statara delivered 8.9M additional contacts with 89% attachment
rates, demonstrating our data enhancement capabilities are scaling effectively.

The franchise dataset development hit a major milestone with Igor's team processing
12,000 PDF files to extract comprehensive location data for 3,000 US franchises, creating
what Brandon Tucker accurately identified as a "game changer" product that no competitor
offers. Early validation shows this could command premium pricing across Fortune 500
accounts.

Goals & Progress

Agentic Development: Jody Roberts achieved 90% completion on roadmap consolidation and
successfully deployed a working data insights agent to staging, though production deployment
remains blocked by authentication infrastructure gaps. The team also built a presentation agent
capable of generating branded HTML presentations, showing the platform's versatility for
internal tooling.

Signal Enhancement: Brandon Wilson refined the "Won Deal in Similar Account" signal
generation process and delivered feedback-ready signals to account managers, advancing our
semantic data integration capabilities. Steve Hutchinson completed analysis planning for
contact recommender signal lift testing, potentially unlocking significant improvements in signal
relevancy.
Data Products: Dow Jones shifted strategic focus from individual dataset releases to
foundational enablement framework development, recognizing that vertical dataset success
requires differentiated go-to-market approaches. This pivot, while delaying restaurant dataset
launch, addresses critical seller enablement gaps that could determine long-term adoption
success.

Strategic Challenges

Our agentic platform infrastructure is fundamentally misaligned with the organization's
"move fast" mandate. Jody's data insights agent has been technically ready for weeks but
remains blocked by Google IAP authentication requirements that demand custom development
and multi-team coordination. This 2+ week permission cycle for routine data access is creating
compound delays across multiple AI initiatives and signals a systemic issue that requires C-level
attention.

ZoomInfo's internal chatbot platform has severe context window limitations that prevent
sophisticated data use cases. Multiple team members hit these constraints when attempting
to build comprehensive data agents, forcing workarounds through external platforms like
Claude. This architectural limitation undermines our ability to leverage our own AI infrastructure
for competitive advantage.

Customer identification and engagement processes for critical initiatives like "definition
of a company" remain ad hoc and resource-intensive. Ethan Young continues struggling to
secure appropriate customer conversations despite this being fundamental to our data model
evolution. This suggests we need formalized customer research processes that don't rely on
individual relationship networks.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

The gap between enterprise customers' data needs and their ability to articulate
solutions is massive. Brandon Tucker's meeting with Walmart's third-party data manager
revealed she oversees 20+ vendors with 100+ products but lacks systematic ways to match
capabilities to use cases. When Adobe requested "email activity data" for Marketo qualification,
there were multiple better solutions than raw email volume - but no mechanism exists to surface
these alternatives. This insight validates our hypothesis that intelligent data recommendation
systems could dramatically expand deal sizes and customer satisfaction.

Vertical datasets require fundamentally different enablement approaches than core
platform data. Dow Jones's strategic pivot to focus on enablement frameworks rather than
rushing additional dataset releases demonstrates mature recognition that first impressions with
GTM teams will determine long-term success. The contractor dataset's early positive signals
validate this approach, but we need systematic processes to avoid repeating one-off
enablement cycles.

Our operational efficiency gains are compounding faster than expected. Dana's team
achieved 5x improvements on conference automation while simultaneously maintaining quality
improvements across multiple data streams. This suggests we're hitting an inflection point
where AI-driven automation is becoming multiplicative rather than additive - a competitive moat
if we can maintain velocity.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our agentic development success depends critically on DevOps and Security teams
establishing streamlined authentication frameworks that don't require custom engineering for
each use case. The current model where every agent needs individual permission architecture
is unsustainable for scaling AI initiatives.

The franchise dataset commercialization requires coordinated execution between Data
Engineering for processing, GTM for enablement, and potentially Marketing for SEO-driven
discovery pages. Igor's insight about creating ZoomInfo franchise landing pages for organic
search positioning could drive significant top-of-funnel acquisition.

Looking Ahead

Next week's focus must prioritize infrastructure unblocking over feature development.
While the team continues advancing on franchise data processing, signal enhancement, and
dataset enablement, the highest-leverage activity is resolving authentication and access control
bottlenecks that are constraining our entire agentic roadmap.

The franchise dataset represents our best near-term opportunity for market-moving
revenue impact. With 200,000 individual franchise locations mapped to parent companies and
complete contact data, this addresses a genuine market gap that Fortune 500 companies will
pay premium prices to access. We should expedite go-to-market preparation and consider
aggressive pricing strategies that reflect the dataset's uniqueness.

We need systematic customer research processes that don't rely on ad hoc relationship
management. The definition of a company initiative's customer engagement challenges
highlight a broader organizational gap in structured customer feedback loops. Success with
vertical datasets and advanced data products requires consistent customer input that current
processes cannot reliably deliver.
