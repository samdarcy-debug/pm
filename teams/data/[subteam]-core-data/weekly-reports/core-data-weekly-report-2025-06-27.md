# **Core Data Executive Roundup - Week of 06/23**

## **Executive Summary**

**Major Email data coverage expansion with 11.2M freemails successfully
infused from 5x5 vendor data.** However, critical engineering resource
constraints are creating bottlenecks across multiple strategic
initiatives, particularly data sharing infrastructure and new product
development. The team delivered on core commitments but faces escalating
coordination challenges with platform teams that require continued
executive alignment to maintain momentum on Q3 priorities.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Freemails Coverage Breakthrough**: Rituparna Das successfully
completed the infusion of 11.2 million freemails from 5x5 vendor data,
directly addressing one of our biggest contact coverage gaps. *Final
attach rates and "best" freemail attribute update counts pending.* This
achievement involved establishing new cross-team processes between
Person Data, Data Analysis, and manual infusion teams, breaking down
organizational silos that had previously slowed vendor onboarding. The
impact extends beyond pure numbers - this data will significantly
improve website visitor resolution and support talent acquisition
partners who rely on freemails for recruitment.

**Person Data Quality Foundation Strengthened**: John Durst completed
the RV Edit paradigm shift, transitioning from hard one-year expiration
to a more nuanced approach with soft expiration at six months. This
change reduces manual maintenance costs while improving data freshness,
and the team successfully validated the new process without customer
impact. Additionally, critical duplicate phone number cleanup identified
1.5 million contacts for potential consolidation testing.

**Strategic Metric Planning Accelerated**: Hayden Cowell finalized the
Polaris metrics one-pager and secured stakeholder approval from Brian
Franceschi, with engineering work broken down into executable
milestones. The team is now positioned to present a comprehensive data
health measurement framework to Hasmik and Brandon, establishing
independent metrics that will guide long-term quality improvements and
AI use case optimization.

### **Goals & Progress**

**GTM Attribute Store Availability & GTM Studio Integration**: Peter
Overman achieved alignment with the GTM Studio team on new data
implementation guides, establishing a clearer handoff process for
datasets entering GTM Store. The team defined request parameters and
low-fidelity mockups for customer-facing workflows, though platform team
execution timelines remain unclear. Cross-functional meetings with
leadership confirmed priority \"patterns\" like dataset-based filtering
and individual record retrieval that require additional platform
development.

**Contributory Network Engineering Resource Allocation**: Heather Ma
made significant progress securing engineering support for the data
sharing page revamp, with requirements reviewed by Integration PMs and
escalated to Hanan\'s team. Executive attention from Nebo and Danish has
elevated the priority, though dedicated resource assignment remains
pending final prioritization discussions. The project is critical for
enabling scalable first-party data infrastructure and unlocking new data
types and use cases.

**Company Data Quarterly Release Preparation & Validation**: Cam Fortin
advanced July cube validation efforts with 80% of release notes drafted.
A concerning 9% drop in companies within the \$500M-\$5B revenue range
required unexpected investigation but was able to be validated without
delaying final release approval.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Data Platform Team Dependencies Creating Bottlenecks**: Multiple
initiatives are stalled due to unclear ownership and resource allocation
across platform teams. The data sharing page lacks dedicated engineering
ownership, with responsibility bouncing between Integration and Data
teams. Similarly, GTM Store functionality development depends on Mark
Delugio\'s team delivering search and indexing capabilities, but firm
delivery dates remain elusive. These dependencies risk delaying
customer-facing releases by months despite data readiness.

**DevOps Resource Constraints Multiplying Project Timelines**: Hayden
Cowell\'s team reports that 15-25% of development time is spent waiting
for simple DevOps access requests, with typical requests taking 5-7 days
for completion. This bottleneck is particularly acute for the DQM team,
where access delays can add full weeks to two-week projects. The team
has proposed self-service access management with DevOps approval, but
implementation requires leadership intervention to change current
processes.

**Analysis Team Bandwidth Limiting Strategic Initiatives**: Competition
for limited data analysis resources is forcing artificial prioritization
between critical projects like 5x5 data utilization and cube validation
work. Jody Roberts emphasized the need for clearer overall
prioritization, noting that attempting multiple parallel analyses
reduces effectiveness across all initiatives. The team needs executive
guidance on which data initiatives should take precedence when analysis
bandwidth becomes the limiting factor.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Vendor Integration Process Optimization**: The 5x5 data infusion
revealed significant gaps in third-party vendor onboarding processes.
Rituparna Das discovered that involving Person Data PM from the
beginning of manual infusions dramatically improved outcomes,
establishing best practices for validation, source configuration, and
error debugging. This approach could be replicated for future vendor
relationships, potentially reducing onboarding time by 50% and improving
data quality outcomes.

**Customer-Specific Data Performance Patterns**: John Durst identified
that large-scale customers focus on highly specific geographic or
industry segments that don\'t align with overall account patterns. For
example, one major customer is currently laser-focused on Australian
data coverage despite their global footprint. This insight suggests the
need for customer-centric data performance dashboards rather than
aggregate metrics, enabling more targeted customer success conversations
and data improvement prioritization.

**Cross-Team Education Gap Impacting Customer Experience**: Analysis of
customer feedback revealed significant internal knowledge gaps about
data capabilities and limitations. Sales and customer success teams lack
foundational understanding of data sources, coverage, and appropriate
use cases, leading to misaligned customer expectations and reactive
support requests. The team is developing systematic internal education
approaches, potentially including quarterly data launches similar to
previous organization practices.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the GTM Platform team on search and indexing functionality
continues to be critical for delivering customer value from new
datasets. Current coordination relies on informal relationships and
competing priorities rather than structured dependency management. We
need clearer accountability mechanisms and firmer delivery commitments
from Mark Delugio\'s team to ensure months of data preparation work
translates into customer-facing capabilities.

The Integration team relationship around data sharing infrastructure
requires immediate attention from Nebo and Hanan. While executive
support exists, actual engineering resource allocation remains unclear,
creating risk for Q3 deliverables that depend on scalable data sharing
capabilities.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on converting this week\'s strategic breakthroughs
into sustainable execution momentum while addressing critical resource
bottlenecks that could derail Q3 objectives.

The team will present the Polaris metrics framework to executive
leadership, potentially securing dedicated resources for systematic data
quality monitoring. Simultaneously, Peter Overman meets with Marc
Delugio to establish firm timelines for search functionality
development, while Heather Ma finalizes engineering resource commitments
from Hanan\'s team. Cam Fortin will resolve the company count
discrepancy in collaboration with Analysis, ensuring July release
readiness without compromising data integrity.

The 5x5 data success creates opportunity for expanded vendor data
utilization across multiple business areas including IP-to-company
resolution and website visitor identification. However, realizing this
potential requires sustained analysis team focus and clear
cross-functional prioritization to prevent resource dilution across
competing initiatives.
