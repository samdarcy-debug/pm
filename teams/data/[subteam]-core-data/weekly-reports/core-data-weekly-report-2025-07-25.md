# **Core Data Executive Roundup - Week of 07/21 - 07/25**

## **Executive Summary**

Rituparna Das drove an increase in person data coverage by infusing 1.2M
validated emails with 50% attach rate and validated legal approval to
proceed with 8.5M mobile records infusion, to continue closing gaps
against competitors like Cognism and Apollo. Meanwhile, Magnus
Herweyer\'s comprehensive stakeholder analysis revealed address
normalization as the unanimous top priority across all data teams,
providing clear strategic direction for the shared services initiative.
Multiple team members struggled with AI tool limitations that slow down
velocity on Q3 planning completion and overall output.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Magnus Herweyer completed 65% of his shared services roadmap creation
through systematic interviews across internal teams and external Chorus
calls, discovering unanimous agreement that address normalization
represents the highest-impact first service. This consensus across PTI,
company, data tools, and monitoring teams provides rare organizational
alignment and clear direction for resource allocation.

Rituparna Das delivered exceptional results on her goal to increase
mobile and business email coverage, infusing 1.2M Revenue Base validated
emails with a strategic 50% attach rate while preventing duplicates.
After navigating an unexpected legal review, she secured approval for
the 8.5M mobile infusion, with 70% completion achieved by Thursday and
full delivery expected by next week Tuesday.

Peter Overman achieved 70% completion on locking down roadmaps for both
web data acquisition and data pipelines teams, completing engineering
manager reviews and establishing frameworks for living documentation.
His work with Corina on platform application enablement for datasets in
GTM Studio continues to navigate complex multi-stakeholder discussions
while maintaining focus on customer use cases.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Roadmap Finalization**: Jody Roberts made substantial progress on the
H2 (Q3/Q4) roadmap finalization using the HTML presentation agent, while
advancing the data insights agent to the point of PTI team handoff.
Critical achievement: securing permissions for traceability API access,
removing a key technical barrier. Discovery of low-hanging fruit
opportunities to leverage agent platform capabilities for common data
questions suggests potential for rapid value creation.

**Cross-Team Coordination**: John Durst executed \"horse trading for H2
on cross team objectives,\" establishing the technographics channel as
the single source for all technographic questions. His collaboration
with Hayden Cowell on validation analysis revealed that Zippy achieves
92% accuracy versus 50% for manually researched phones - a finding that
fundamentally challenges data quality assumptions.

**Research Enablement**: Hayden Cowell worked to pull research samples
for Polaris metrics and update researcher instructions to include
Brandon\'s subjective scoring methodology for SMB/mid-market segments.
While sample pulling was delayed due to Valerie\'s absence, the
methodology updates position the team to model customer perception where
objective data doesn\'t exist.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Cam Fortin\'s goal to create high-level project documents for team
alignment revealed a systematic challenge: the Thursday reflection
meeting creates uncertainty in goal completion reporting since Friday is
often when substantial work gets completed. This timing misalignment
affects accurate status reporting and mirrors sprint estimation
challenges, potentially undermining executive visibility.

Magnus Herweyer faces complex implementation decisions to address
normalization without dedicated engineering resources (Casey out for two
weeks). The choice between leveraging existing PTI or company solutions
versus building new infrastructure that supports both batch and
streaming has significant technical debt implications for the shared
services foundation.

Multiple team members encountered AI tool reliability issues, with Cam
Fortin losing 6 hours to chatbot errors that \"constantly errors out.\"
This forced reversion to manual processes at a critical planning
juncture, highlighting the gap between AI tool promise and current
reality while potentially delaying Q3 commitment finalization.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

John Durst\'s identification of a critical blind spot - \"we should have
better analysis around individual sources of information and their
accuracy\" - gained immediate validation through his phone validation
work. The discovery that ZIPI (automated email signatures) achieves 92%
accuracy versus 50% for human-validated phones suggests the organization
lacks systematic source quality measurement and may be misallocating
validation resources.

Legal\'s unexpected intervention on mobile data usage, as noted by
Rituparna Das, exposed process gaps in cross-functional coordination.
While she successfully navigated to approval, the last-minute nature
reveals the need for proactive legal partnership in data expansion
initiatives to prevent delays that could impact competitive positioning
against Apollo and Cognism.

The universal emergence of address normalization as top priority across
all stakeholder interviews conducted by Magnus Herweyer provides rare
organizational consensus. This alignment creates an opportunity to
deliver immediate value through shared services while building
credibility for the broader platform vision.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our collaboration with the PTI team reaches a critical milestone with
Tuesday\'s scheduled handoff of Jody Roberts\' data insights agent. With
traceability API permissions now granted, organizational readiness for
agent-powered workflows faces its first real test.

Peter Overman\'s work with data pipelines teams under Brian and Roi
continues to require careful navigation through 40+ JIRA items and
confusing nomenclature (teams calling themselves both \"data
acquisition\" and \"data pipelines\"). His focus on protecting customer
use cases while managing multi-stakeholder complexity remains essential
for Q3 success.

Rituparna Das identified a blind spot where \"same mobile used by
multiple contacts\" creates data quality challenges, particularly as the
Data Enablement team conducts parallel mobile infusions without
following the pre-validation processes her team established for 5x5
data.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on converting planning progress into executable Q3
commitments while addressing the systematic challenges uncovered this
week.

Magnus Herweyer will complete his shared services roadmap by merging
internal and external feedback, with specific implementation
recommendations for address normalization. Rituparna Das finalizes the
8.5M mobile infusion and socializes coverage improvements while
reviewing local address engineering findings. Peter Overman pushes to
100% completion on both roadmaps while establishing review cadences with
leadership.

Critical process improvements take priority as the team addresses the
Thursday/Friday reporting disconnect and establishes fallback procedures
for AI tool failures. Hayden Cowell\'s research sample pull proceeds
with Valerie\'s return, enabling subjective scoring methodology
implementation. John Durst advances development of systematic source
accuracy measurement to address the critical blind spot identified this
week.

The convergence of operational lessons with strategic discoveries
positions the team to enter Q3 with clarity of purpose, realistic tool
expectations, and renewed focus on data quality fundamentals that drive
competitive advantage.
