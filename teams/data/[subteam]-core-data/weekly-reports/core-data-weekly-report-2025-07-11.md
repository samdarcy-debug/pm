# **Core Data Executive Roundup - Week of 07/07 - 07/11**

## **Executive Summary**

Magnus Herweyer joined as the new PM for shared services**.** Meanwhile,
Jody Roberts achieved a breakthrough in AI agent development,
successfully building a functional agent that calls person and company
APIs within days, demonstrating the rapid prototyping potential of the
new agentic platform. Cam Fortin faced a critical setback with the July
15th release requiring last-minute rollback of employee growth rate
updates but was able to get the Company data updates and cube released
prior to July 15th.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**AI Agent Platform Breakthrough**: Jody Roberts successfully built a
working data insights agent that automatically connects to person and
company APIs and answers thematic questions, proving the new agentic
platform can enable rapid prototyping. The infrastructure automatically
handles API connections and authentication, allowing focus on features
rather than technical setup. This validates the strategy of dedicating
team time to agent development as achievable weekly goals.

**Shared Services Strategic Vision**: Magnus Herweyer, despite starting
just this week, developed a comprehensive vision for shared services
that addresses the \"crimes against humanity\" data problem - enabling
customers to submit terrible CRM data and receive normalized, enriched,
validated output through a unified \"fix it\" service. This builds on
his AWS experience where poor data quality required thousands of
engineering hours to answer basic board questions.

**Mobile Data Infrastructure Completion**: Rituparna Das achieved 80%
completion on mobile validation goals, successfully defining the mobile
infusion checklist framework and securing data science resources
starting Monday. With 8.5 million mobiles ready for processing and
clarity achieved on MAT-to-HIM association requirements, the team is
positioned to significantly expand mobile coverage next week.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Release Management Under Pressure**: Cam Fortin coordinated emergency
response to a critical July 15th release issue requiring rollback of
employee growth rate updates. Despite the late-breaking nature of this
problem and his upcoming vacation, Cam successfully organized the
necessary testing and coordination across API, offline enrichment, and
cube teams to maintain the Tuesday release schedule.

**Data Sharing Infrastructure Advancement**: Heather Ma secured
engineering alignment and received a concrete timeline estimate of 3
weeks for admin portal backend development from the integration team.
The engineering team expressed confidence in the scope and requirements,
though some internal team structure questions remain between DOS6 and
DOS12 teams that could affect resource allocation.

**Strategic Roadmapping Acceleration**: John Durst progressed 50% toward
completing roadmapping one-pagers while identifying critical data
quality visibility gaps. His work revealed the need for consistent
source-by-source accuracy metrics rather than high-level aggregates,
potentially informing future analytics integration work. Additionally,
data science teams requested prioritized project lists with specific
focus on email generation and company industry classification.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Cross-Team Resource Bottlenecks Escalating**: Hayden Cowell\'s team
reported significant delays from BI team resource constraints and
timezone coordination challenges with Israeli engineering teams. Simple
requests requiring 1-2 story points face month-long delays, while
dependency tickets become ineffective when blockers emerge during
investigation phases. This pattern is multiplying across multiple
strategic initiatives, requiring executive intervention to establish
clearer prioritization frameworks.

**Data Quality Measurement Infrastructure Gaps**: John Durst\'s analysis
revealed fundamental blind spots in source-by-source data quality
metrics, particularly around comparing accuracy between sources like
Zippy and RV edits. The team operates with high-level quality indicators
but lacks systematic, regularly updated comparisons that would inform
data acquisition strategy and identify coverage gaps requiring
attention.

**Release Coordination Complexity**: The July 15th release issue exposed
coordination challenges when critical changes emerge late in the
process. With Cam Fortin heading into vacation immediately after
managing this crisis, the team faces questions about backup coverage and
process resilience for future high-stakes releases requiring rapid
cross-team coordination.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**AI Agent Development Velocity**: Jody Roberts\' successful agent
development in just a few days demonstrates that the new agentic
platform can enable meaningful weekly goals focused on customer-facing
prototypes rather than infrastructure setup. The automatic API
integration and authentication handling removes traditional technical
barriers, suggesting the team should prioritize agent development as
high-impact, achievable weekly objectives.

**Enterprise Data Quality Market Opportunity**: Magnus Herweyer\'s AWS
experience reveals the massive scale of enterprise data quality
problems, where companies invest thousands of engineering hours just to
answer basic business questions due to poor CRM data standardization.
His \"fix it\" service vision addresses a universal pain point that
could differentiate ZoomInfo\'s go-to-market studio platform while
improving internal data processing capabilities.

**Source-Level Quality Blindspots**: John Durst\'s investigation
uncovered that the team lacks systematic quality comparisons between
different data sources, operating instead with assumption-based
hierarchies. This discovery suggests implementing regular
source-by-source accuracy measurement could improve both data
acquisition strategy and customer transparency about data provenance and
confidence levels.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the BI team continues to create significant bottlenecks
for contributory network monitoring and other strategic initiatives.
Hayden Cowell\'s team faces month-long delays for simple requests due to
resource constraints and unclear prioritization frameworks. The lack of
product management oversight for the BI team exacerbates coordination
challenges, requiring executive intervention to establish accountability
mechanisms.

The integration team relationship around data sharing infrastructure
shows positive momentum with Heather Ma securing dedicated engineering
resources and clear timelines. However, internal team structure
questions between DOS6 and DOS12 teams could affect resource allocation
and require clarification from engineering leadership to maintain
project momentum.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on capitalizing on the AI agent development
breakthrough while addressing the resource coordination challenges that
threaten multiple strategic initiatives.

Magnus will work with Jody and Brandon to refine the shared services
vision during their Vancouver office visit, potentially establishing a
transformative roadmap for enterprise data quality services. Rituparna
Das will complete mobile infusion processing with newly secured data
science resources, extending 5x5 data utilization beyond freemails.
Peter Overman will finalize Form 5500 schema work and accelerate his CRM
enhancement discovery, which Brandon identified as potentially
game-changing for improving customer integration match rates. John Durst
will complete roadmapping one-pagers while the team addresses data
science team requests for prioritized project lists across email
generation and company classification initiatives.

The successful AI agent development creates opportunity for rapid
customer-facing prototypes that demonstrate data platform capabilities,
while Magnus\'s shared services vision provides a compelling framework
for next-generation go-to-market studio functionality that could
obsolete enterprise data quality challenges.
