| **Engineering Resource Constraints**       | **GTM Studio Team:** ROI Analytics trending red on January delivery for Workbook, Workspace, Agentic Chat, and AI Credits ROI because four dependency teams haven\'t committed timelines despite having complete gap analysis and all dependency tickets created in Jira. The Agentic Chat team explicitly confirmed they can\'t prioritize instrumentation work until end of November, while Workbook and Workspace teams haven\'t provided any timeline. P0 blockers include: Workbooks needs BigTable data copied to Snowflake/ZDP (would unblock 99% of work), Workspace needs Amplitude instrumentation for more than half of CTAs plus views-related data moved to Snowflake/ZDP, and 60% of workspace metrics aren\'t persisted in backend. |

|                                            | **SalesOS/Copilot Team:** Backend engineering capacity constraints threaten December artifact and chat-to-views delivery. The apps team\'s most senior engineers are heavily absorbed by the GTM Data Model POC, creating a significant bottleneck for critical Workspace features. Ryan Stevens\' team is working on bulk emailer, chat-to-views, and other initiatives that Victor identified as essential for demonstrating Workspace\'s value, but capacity limitations forced Sean to pull back on some view improvements and non-urgent user feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|                                            | **ZIM Team:** The 47% ACV churn is a direct consequence of deprioritizing ZIM to staff GTM Studio and the Agentic platform. With \$4M in December renewals (60% status unknown), we need the bug bash in Sprint 25.25 to address customer-facing issues. This resource allocation tradeoff was necessary for strategic priorities, but we must demonstrate value to at-risk customers immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Data Quality & Pipeline Issues**         | **Semantic Data Team:** The team identified a significant data retrieval gap: approximately 8% of processed accounts (2,000-2,500 of 35,000) lack ZoomInfo company IDs, rendering their semantic data invisible to downstream consumers despite successful processing. This stems from upstream Chorus ingestion issues where transcripts arrive with Chorus IDs but without the corresponding ZoomInfo company mappings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|                                            | **GTM Studio Team:** Semantic enrichment coverage issues require root cause investigation from Search team. Jagannath\'s team continues encountering coverage problems where only 50-60% of requests return results, even for accounts where conversation intelligence data definitely exists. The team spent 6-7 hours building the studio-on-studio marketing campaign list for RNG and encountered numerous blockers with semantic not returning expected results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|                                            | **Product Ops Team:** Voice of Customer data filtering challenge was identified as significant enough that Dominik raised it to Rowan and the GTM Studio team. While Ken and Brett achieved good results in their analysis, the underlying difficulty of getting the right data set filtered properly represents a blocker that needs resolution to make VOC analysis consistently reliable and scalable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **DevOps & Infrastructure Blockers**       | **GTM Studio Team:** GTM Data Store migration issue pushed GA release target to January. The DevOps issue blocking migration was fixed (problem with loading data into SingleStore after 20-30 minute runs), but extended troubleshooting means the team needs about a month of validation testing after cutover, pushing GA from original December 9 timeline to January.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

We\'ve tried removing semantic data from descriptions without resolution. Rowan is exploring two parallel paths: leveraging Dominik\'s OpenAI contacts for direct technical escalation, and opening a developer support account to attempt standard troubleshooting channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Cross-Team Coordination & Dependencies** | **Integrations Team:** The SalesOS customer interface gap continues creating friction, evidenced by escalations from Zoom Video and BBSI this week. Both customers discovered ZoomInfo had opportunity data when they saw the ROI dashboard, but since they\'re only on SalesOS, they questioned why ZoomInfo possesses this data without giving them adequate access. This blocks the Q3 goal of deprecating SalesOS and needs support from Victor, Philip, and Dominik to define a path forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### **Bottom Line**

Studio and Workspace officially launched as Tier 1 products with strong early traction, generating significant pipeline through the studio-to-workspace activation demo. However, maintaining this momentum requires rapid resolution of systemic resource constraints and coordination challenges that are threatening December deliverables. Three critical patterns emerge: (1) engineering capacity absorbed by GTM Data Model POC work is creating bottlenecks for Workspace features Victor identified as essential for demonstrating 10x value over Copilot V1, (2) semantic data quality and retrieval issues (8% missing company IDs, 50-60% coverage gaps) are undermining customer confidence in AI capabilities, and (3) cross-team dependencies around orchestration architecture, ROI instrumentation, and data pipeline coordination require executive intervention to maintain Q4 execution velocity. The positive signals---60% LLM cost reduction, automated release systems proving feasibility, ByteMine mobile phone infusions exceeding targets by 78%---demonstrate technical capability, but systematic resource allocation decisions are needed to convert this capability into customer value before year-end renewal conversations.

### **GTM Studio**

**GTM Studio Team:** \"ROI Analytics encountered a DevOps blocker with GTM Data Store migration that pushed the GA release target to January, while Arun\'s team is trending red on January delivery for Workbook, Workspace, Agentic Chat, and AI Credits ROI due to dependency teams not committing timelines---the Agentic Chat team won\'t prioritize instrumentation until end of November, and Workbook/Workspace teams haven\'t confirmed when they can pick up work despite having all dependency tickets created in Jira. Workbooks remains on track for January M4 Data Management Foundation delivery with Ash completing segment and dedupe design handoffs while kicking off ideal user journey research, plus advancing the Waterfall POC with second-round designs and legal alignment completed ahead of the Bethesda onsite. Plays deployed the M1 proof of concept to staging and is pivoting to enhance M2 scope after design workshops with Sneh, Karthik, and Derek revealed the need for better preview and governance experiences rather than rushing a half-baked product, with Mohan leading iterations on test run capabilities and credit consumption controls that don\'t exist in DoubleO today. Data Management is progressing across all three active milestones with Corina\'s team validating the V2 Data Health Scan with customers while kicking off front-end development, plus advancing the AI onboarding steel-thread narrative that connects data health visibility, configuration setup, and ongoing management into an end-to-end experience.\"

### **GTM Copilot Workspace**

**SalesOS/Copilot Team:** \"Sean Walter is preparing for three-week paternity leave (starting Nov. 20th) and completing handoff documentation for critical Copilot Workspace initiatives. The team achieved important momentum on Pulses with a 4,000-seller survey launched and Next Best Actions (NBA) agent now live in production via the Orchestrator. However, backend capacity constraints---particularly on the apps team absorbed by GTM Data Model POC work---threaten December delivery timelines for artifacts and chat-to-views functionality that Victor identified as essential for demonstrating Workspace\'s 10x value over Copilot V1.\"

### **GTM AI Context Service**

**Intelligence Team:** \"The team achieved a major cost breakthrough this week with 60% reduction in LLM costs through prompt caching implementation, though this savings isn\'t yet passed to customers due to AI Credit Service limitations. Meanwhile, front-end design for the trigger experience is progressing with a newly assigned designer, and the first version of the orchestration platform (00) is ready for production deployment Monday with full M1 tool support. Critical architectural decisions around semantic data scalability are being evaluated with Milvus showing 2-3x performance gains over current solutions.\"

**Semantic Data Team:** \"The team identified a significant data retrieval gap: approximately 8% of processed accounts (2,000-2,500 of 35,000) lack ZoomInfo company IDs, rendering their semantic data invisible to downstream consumers despite successful processing. This stems from upstream Chorus ingestion issues where transcripts arrive with Chorus IDs but without the corresponding ZoomInfo company mappings. The team has documented the complete debugging flow and is coordinating with the Chorus team to resolve the ID resolution pipeline. Concurrently, Jon is automating quality validation scripts to prevent similar issues from surfacing late, while Jun\'s onboarding accelerates the team\'s capacity for parallel investigation work.\"

**MCP Tiger Team:** \"The team made substantial progress on MCP infrastructure fundamentals this week, with Topher delivering control plane functionality for server creation and Carter advancing the config server implementation. However, a security flagging issue with the ChatGPT connector has emerged as the primary blocker---OpenAI\'s systems are marking our integration as unsafe, and their lack of diagnostic visibility makes troubleshooting extremely difficult. We\'re pursuing both executive channels through Dominik and direct support routes, while Anthropic has granted us beta access to programmatic tool calling and tool search features that warrant near-term exploration.\"

### **Vertical Datasets**

**Data Executive Team:** Igor Kyrylenko completed acquisition of 29 states for professional licenses data and initiated FOIA requests for automotive dealerships and building permits across major jurisdictions. The team has already received 11 states of automotive dealership data and sent requests to 67 of the largest municipalities for construction permit data. This represents 72% U.S. population coverage for professional licenses and establishes a natural competitive barrier, as acquiring and normalizing data from 50+ disparate state systems requires significant time and resources that competitors would struggle to replicate.

### **Other Data**

**Data Executive Team:** \"ByteMine mobile phone infusions exceeded targets by 78%, successfully pushing 3.5M records into production with PTI resolving a critical processing bug that had been causing bottlenecks. Brandon Tucker is leading a hands-on effort to democratize dataset onboarding through GTM Studio, walking the GitHub dataset through the process to identify friction points and building AI agents to automate documentation. The team is addressing a growing confusion among sales about Company Master vs traditional matching, which is creating unnecessary friction in customer conversations and requiring immediate enablement with Yixing\'s team. Ethan Young\'s Company 3.0 testing environments are now operational, marking the first phase of validating the new pipeline\'s matching capabilities.\"

**Core Data Team:** \"The Core Data team made strong progress across multiple strategic initiatives this week, positioning us well for Q4 deliverables and 2026 planning. The waterfall integration achieved data-side readiness for December 1st delivery, while Heather Ma\'s Deal Insight Agent reached production-ready status with full cross-team alignment. The team also advanced Forrester Wave preparations, launched an accelerated GTM Store integration process, and established a new monthly release notes framework for improved customer communication. While we swarmed a Spamhaus blocking incident mid-week through rapid remediation with our ESP partner, the team maintained momentum on critical M8 infrastructure requirements and Board of Directors product development.\"

### **Other Platform**

**GTM Data Platform Team:** \"By obtaining cross-team alignment to maintain BigQuery alongside Solr through the GraphQL API to support the Dec 1st developer workshop, Marc Delurgio, Linda Johannessen, and Menna Rashwan preserved momentum with the apps teams and de-risked the December 31st deadline to have GQL ready for apps teams, while establishing a clear migration path to Solr as feature parity develops. The scope expansion adding Engagement data mid-stream to Solr created immediate delivery pressure, but the team\'s agile approach will meet commitments while building toward the Solr-based solution.\"

**Integrations Team:** \"ZoomInfo is positioned to be showcased at Google Next with Engine as the customer highlighting our Agentforce solution, validating our strategic direction in the agent ecosystem. Prateek Paikray is leading the Salesforce Agentforce partnership, which has flagged a \$500M Q4 pipeline and wants ZoomInfo integrated into their sales motions, though they\'re requesting free Copilot seats for their sellers---Prateek is coordinating with Adam Sayles and partnerships on commercial terms. The Field Mapping Agent now works end-to-end in staging and will be demoed at the Agent Think meeting this week, while backend improvements for import mapping redesign are enabling Rayee to start frontend work next week.\"

**Automation Team:** \"Data connector library launches to production while no-code function builder prototype demonstrates component reusability. Marc Frail successfully launched the initial data connector library and enabled website visitor tracking with buyer ID support from the global event bus. Sam Massie completed no-code function builder prototype and engineering kickoff, discovering significant component reuse opportunities across existing integration infrastructure.\"

**ZIM Team:** \"Big win: Zoominfo was named an ABM(Account based marketing) leader for the second year in a row by Gartner! We\'re facing a critical inflection point: ZIM achieved 92% net retention in October, but 47% ACV churn---our highest in a year---with \$4M in December renewals at risk (60% unknown status). This is the result of engineering reallocation to GTM Studio and the Agentic platform. Filip has escalated to Sneh and Dominik, and we\'ve scheduled a bug bash for Sprint 25.25 (first week of December) to address customer-facing issues before these renewals close. Meanwhile, our infrastructure work continues to progress with Matt Barnes\' website identity pipeline back on track and MCR launching Tuesday.\"

**Provisioning & Login Team:** The Admin Defined Territories feature pushed final UI tweaks to production staging, targeting Monday/Tuesday feature flag opening for the main November release. The team completed Info Packs documentation and additional upload templates while working through MCP integration to open territories into the agentic layer. David also advanced Priority Accounts work with initial UX designs for CRM rules socialized across the Context team, though progress was slowed by urgent customer escalations requiring developer attention.

### **Other Operations**

**Product Ops Team:** \"The team achieved a major breakthrough in automated release processes this week, successfully creating the first version of automated product information extraction from code that will fundamentally change how product releases work. Daniel Kong and Kristin Gandini proved out the automated changelog system can work in production, processing engineering\'s AI release tech output into deployment summaries that generated release notes with PM demo videos for the November 18 release. Ken Elwell successfully built the Voice of Customer pitch analysis system in GTM Studio, demonstrating a compelling use case that connects customer call analysis at scale with Workspace execution capabilities. The week\'s ELT session on Workspace and GTM Studio pitches revealed that while the semantic pipeline has the right components, filtering data to solve specific GTM Studio use cases remains challenging and requires focused attention.\"

**Product BI Team:** The team delivered the first Voice of Customer report analyzing two weeks of sales conversations, providing an objective data foundation that sales leadership can reference when prioritizing product decisions and objection handling. Brett and the team provided comprehensive data on chat reliability issues and user adoption patterns that are informing critical Workspace improvement priorities.

### **Individual Team Reports**

## **DAI Executive Team Weekly Report - November 10-14, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Studio and Workspace officially launched as Tier 1 products last week with strong sales momentum, generating significant pipeline through the studio-to-workspace activation demo. However, maintaining this momentum requires rapid product improvements as the sales team encounters expected headwinds around AI credits pricing and workspace feature gaps. The team is executing a two-pronged strategy: delivering tangible November/December improvements to sustain seller confidence while building the foundational orchestration architecture that will power differentiated experiences in plays and pulses.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Victor and Sneh\'s launch execution drove substantial early traction, with Alex Lazerovich\'s team building meaningful pipeline off the studio-to-workspace integration in just the first week. The sales team conducted the platform demo with Antuna\'s RNG organization and Rob Lauderman\'s strategic leaders, receiving positive sentiment that while products are early, the rapid improvement trajectory is encouraging. Brett and the team delivered the first Voice of Customer report analyzing two weeks of sales conversations, providing an objective data foundation that sales leadership can reference when prioritizing product decisions and objection handling.

Adam made progress unblocking the agent orchestration roadmap challenge between Studio plays and Workspace long-running tasks, identifying a path forward that reprioritizes the A2A message broker work. The engineering team secured additional resourcing in today\'s meeting, which will prevent the work from seizing up while product-level alignment continues over the next few weeks. This architectural decision positions the team to consolidate what were previously separate implementations for bulk email campaigns, multi-agent tasks, and plays into a unified orchestration system.

Ali and the engineering team established a viable path forward on the GraphQL backend architecture dilemma between Solr and BigQuery. The team can continue using BigQuery for engagements while Najet and Brian work through mapping scalars and operators to support the metadata-driven model in Solr. This approach prevents the team from boxing themselves into an architecture that won\'t scale while maintaining forward progress on workspace enrichment capabilities.

**Goals & Progress**

**Product Launch Momentum:** Studio and Workspace launched as Tier 1 products with the studio-to-workspace activation serving as the most differentiated demo in the portfolio. The next two product releases on November 18 and December 1 are positioned as make-or-break moments for winning over sales team confidence. Victor is balancing the December 1st bulk email delay against the strategic decision to build on long-term orchestration architecture rather than a hacky solution, recognizing that the time delta between approaches isn\'t substantial and the right architecture will free up development resources across multiple roadmap items.

**Sales Enablement and Field Readiness:** The team completed comprehensive enablement sessions covering GTM Studio foundations, Workspace capabilities, competitive landscape, and demo deep dives. Solutions consultants are equipped to run demos in production, and VPs each have dedicated workbooks they\'re activating with their reps. The first AI Action Credit report went out tracking early consumption patterns across nine accounts, all currently on the Studio side, establishing baseline reporting that will evolve as workspace adoption scales and more cohorts come online.

**Platform Architecture and Infrastructure:** Brandon\'s team made strong progress preparing for the waterfall onsite, completing design reviews and beginning dataset onboarding acceleration work that adds three new datasets from a schema perspective. The team is documenting the onboarding process by walking the GitHub dataset through end-to-end to identify gaps and democratize knowledge beyond a few individuals. Jody highlighted that Clay\'s primary advantage currently is waterfall, positioning the upcoming work as directly addressing the main competitive threat with superior pricing and data quality.

**Strategic Challenges**

The backend architecture decision for GraphQL and query capabilities created friction this week when the limitation between Solr and BigQuery became apparent Friday morning. While the team established a path forward using BigQuery for engagements temporarily, Ali raised concerns about time pressure forcing a decision that boxes the architecture into an approach that won\'t work long-term. The question of how to balance immediate delivery needs against scalable architecture remains, though Andres suggested continuing with what works while figuring out the right solution in parallel.

Workspace is experiencing chat reliability issues that are eroding trust with internal users, with some reporting that data is frequently incorrect or chat pulls wrong accounts for their role. Victor noted that 60-70% of users always or often double-check data in Salesforce, and response times are rated slower than acceptable by the majority. These quality issues, combined with users hitting the 2000 row limit and difficulty finding relevant fields, require dedicated focus on user experience improvements to prevent the internal perception challenges that plagued SalesOS adoption.

Megan identified that designers aren\'t consistently working closely enough with engineers, requiring product managers to serve as the middleman to ensure designs are implemented correctly. This process gap is creating quality issues and slowing down the team\'s ability to ship polished experiences. The team is working to shift designers toward direct collaboration with engineers and taking more ownership of visual quality assurance, reducing the burden on product management while improving implementation fidelity.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The revenue leader persona presents an interesting product positioning challenge, as even top revenue leaders struggle with Studio\'s complexity despite showing some success. Victor and Sneh identified that workspace is the more natural environment for these leaders to work, but this requires critical decisions around guardrails to prevent them from burning AI credits at the same magnitude as Studio power users. The team is aligned philosophically that leaders want to use the same tools their sellers use, making workspace audience-building capabilities inevitable regardless of product strategy.

Dominik surfaced that real-time events integration represents significant untapped value, particularly as website signals currently operate on a 24-hour delay. With the global event bus and change data capture infrastructure now in place, integrating this into workspace could deliver a major capability jump. The team validated that IBM specifically needs real-time website resolution, and many flywheel partners require this functionality, driving Mark Farrell\'s current work to hook this up via webhook. The vision is that someone visiting a site triggers a play within a minute that surfaces to sellers.

The Voice of Customer analysis revealed that the studio-to-workspace activation naturally leads sellers to frame the push to sales as \"plays\" even though the current product doesn\'t fully support this mental model. View publishing solves some use cases but doesn\'t deliver the tasks and to-dos that sellers expect from true play automation. This gap between sales narrative and product capability creates pressure to accelerate plays delivery while being very clear about which use cases the current workspace activation actually addresses.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The orchestration architecture work that Adam, Derek, and Karthik are driving has significant implications across Victor and Sneh\'s product dependencies. The team scheduled a Friday review with Nebo, Carlos, and Sneh to align everyone on the consolidated approach, which will clarify the UX design requirements and scope of work. Sean will be added to the prioritization sessions to ensure workspace requirements are properly represented. This unified direction should eliminate double work between bulk email systems, task queue implementations, and plays activation while accelerating overall delivery.

Ali and the platform team\'s GraphQL interface work directly impacts Victor\'s go-to-market data model integration deliverables. The team is still working through the implications with Nebo, Rakesh, and Sean as they evaluate how the Solr backend decisions affect integration timelines. Brandon\'s waterfall enrichment work similarly depends on clear data integration patterns and the GTM attribute store roadmap, requiring continued alignment between data teams and product teams on priorities and sequencing.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on the waterfall onsite in Bethesda where Brandon, Sneh, and their teams will converge on audiences, plays, and waterfall architecture. This working session aims to solve several foundational problems around audience building as a set of tasks, API access for external tools like Cursor, and the integration of real-time data triggers. The team will focus on making these systems work end-to-end rather than treating them as separate planning exercises.

Victor is pushing aggressively to increase workspace demo volume by spreading examples of successful demos across the company and conducting a blitz on workspace-solo presentations versus the studio expansion motion that has dominated early sales conversations. Simultaneously, the team is working to deliver a workspace pulse feed as a bridge to the full plays-powered solution, building it in a way that can incorporate pulses from plays when ready. This interim approach balances the need to show sales momentum now while not compromising the longer-term architecture that will truly differentiate the product.

The team continues balancing rapid iteration velocity with the need for stability, as Mary\'s feedback about moving too fast highlights the importance of over-communication through release notes and automated updates. Brett is working to solve the communication challenge without slowing down product improvement speed. With aggressive goals through the end of the year and teams running hot in a productive way, the focus remains on maintaining momentum while solving the orchestration, architecture, and quality challenges that will determine Q4 success.

## **GTM Studio Team Weekly Report - November 10-14, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

ROI Analytics encountered a DevOps blocker with GTM Data Store migration that pushed the GA release target to January, while Arun\'s team is trending red on January delivery for Workbook, Workspace, Agentic Chat, and AI Credits ROI due to dependency teams not committing timelines---the Agentic Chat team won\'t prioritize instrumentation until end of November, and Workbook/Workspace teams haven\'t confirmed when they can pick up work despite having all dependency tickets created in Jira. Workbooks remains on track for January M4 Data Management Foundation delivery with Ash completing segment and dedupe design handoffs while kicking off ideal user journey research, plus advancing the Waterfall POC with second-round designs and legal alignment completed ahead of the Bethesda onsite. Plays deployed the M1 proof of concept to staging and is pivoting to enhance M2 scope after design workshops with Sneh, Karthik, and Derek revealed the need for better preview and governance experiences rather than rushing a half-baked product, with Mohan leading iterations on test run capabilities and credit consumption controls that don\'t exist in DoubleO today. Data Management is progressing across all three active milestones with Corina\'s team validating the V2 Data Health Scan with customers while kicking off front-end development, plus advancing the AI onboarding steel-thread narrative that connects data health visibility, configuration setup, and ongoing management into an end-to-end experience.

**Key Momentum Areas**

**Plays Infrastructure Proves Technical Foundation While Design Pivots to Enhanced Experience:** The team successfully deployed DoubleO plays proof of concept to staging, demonstrating that workflows can execute within GTM Studio\'s interface. Multiple design workshops this week with Sneh, Karthik, and Derek surfaced valuable feedback leading to a strategic pivot---rather than rush workbook-to-play activation alone, the M2 scope will include enhanced preview and governance experiences that DoubleO lacks today. Mohan\'s team is iterating on test run capabilities that let users validate plays with dummy inputs before full execution, plus designing credit consumption controls and notification flows that apply to both one-off and real-time runs.

**Data Management Foundation Completes Design Phase and Kicks Off Development:** Ash\'s team handed off segment and dedupe designs this week while wrapping resolution screen wireframes, concluding the generic M4 wireframe phase. The team kicked off ideal user journey research to optimize the long-term UX after following an \"unblock now, refine later\" pattern to maintain January delivery momentum. For Workbooks, engagement-based workbook requirements are complete and ready for engineering handoff, while the Waterfall POC advanced significantly with second-round designs, legal clearance from James and the content team on partnership obligations, and final design review scheduled for Monday ahead of the Bethesda onsite.

**Data Health Scan V2 Validates Metrics with Real Customer Data:** Corina\'s team shipped V2 of the Data Health Scan proof of concept this week, which matches exactly what will be built in GTM Studio and enables deep validation of metrics with customers before production development. The team met with multiple customers and internal stakeholders who provided strong validation with no surprising feedback, while front-end development officially kicked off. The biggest learning was around filtering capabilities for customers with multiple subsidiaries in one CRM---Andres\' team already built this in Advanced Sync, so once available, the Data Health Scan will automatically filter to show only relevant records based on tenant ID.

**Goals & Progress**

**Workbooks**

**Progress - January M4 Foundation on Track with Design Handoffs Complete:** Ash\'s team remains on track for January M4 Data Management Foundation delivery, completing segment and dedupe design handoffs this week while beginning ideal user journey research to fine-tune the UX beyond the \"unblock now, refine later\" approach that maintained engineering momentum. Resolution screen wireframes need one more week due to complexity but don\'t impact the January timeline since engineering isn\'t ready to begin that work yet. For Workbooks, the Waterfall POC progressed significantly with second-round designs complete, legal and branding alignment secured with James and the content team, and final design review scheduled for Monday ahead of next week\'s Bethesda onsite to secure organizational alignment. Engagement-based workbook requirements are complete and ready for engineering handoff.

**Strategic Challenges - Engagement Data Use Case Requires Clear Scoping Before Release (Clear path forward):** The engagement-based workbook use case being advertised comes with significant caveats since it won\'t include User Preferences (UP) functionality at launch, creating potential data and functionality risks if released without clear constraints defined. The requirements have been handed off multiple times over the past six months, and Ash is scheduling a meeting Monday with the engagement data team to establish exactly when this capability arrives and what limitations exist. The team recognizes that releasing engagement data workbooks without proper UP integration means users won\'t have the privacy controls and data governance they expect, so the path forward is to clearly document these limitations and determine if the use case should wait for UP or launch with explicit caveats to customers.

**Plays**

**Progress - M1 POC Deployed to Staging While M2 Scope Pivots to Enhanced Experience:** Mohan\'s team successfully deployed the DoubleO plays proof of concept to staging this week, demonstrating that the technical foundation works---users can execute DoubleO workflows directly within GTM Studio\'s interface. The team conducted multiple design workshops with Sneh, Karthik, and Derek that surfaced valuable feedback leading to a strategic pivot for M2 scope. Rather than rushing workbook-to-play activation alone to early access customers in January, the team will include enhanced preview and governance experiences that DoubleO lacks today. Neha\'s team finalized the November tools priority list, resolved all P0 bugs in staging testing, and successfully onboarded the DoubleO service into Backstage for proper release ticket approval workflow. The team is also working through React versus Angular front-end implementation approach, with clearer direction emerging after the decision to send users to a dedicated plays area rather than using an overlay experience.

**Strategic Challenges - Preview and Governance Experiences Need Iteration Before January Launch (No additional action required):** The design workshops revealed that DoubleO workflows don\'t support true test run capabilities today, creating a wonky experience when customers want to validate plays with dummy inputs and make changes before full execution. Mohan\'s team is actively iterating on preview flows that let users see results for the first 10 records before running jobs on full workbooks, plus designing governance experiences around notifications, credit consumption controls, and audit trails that apply to both one-off and real-time runs. The team is also working through where filtering capabilities should live---the current thinking is that filtering stays on the input side (workbooks) while plays focus purely on orchestration steps. These iterations are happening now with continued design reviews scheduled with product leaders to lock in the enhanced M2 scope, keeping the team on track for meaningful early access readiness in January without rushing incomplete functionality.

**ROI Analytics**

**Some customers may highlight \'they were unaware if opportunity data was being shared with ZoomInfo\':** ROI analytics is a product that makes it very obvious to the admins of our customers that we are looking at their Opportunity data from the CRM sync. Brahm and Andres got pulled into a customer escalation this week (BBSI), where the customer highlighted that they do not like the fact that ZoomInfo is looking at their Opportunity data (as a public company, that can carry risks). Based on an investigation from the platform team, we realized that this customer was in the cohort of \'auto-on\' email messages that were sent out earlier in the year. This specific admin had not received the email apparently. They requested for opportunity data to be immediately deleted from our GTM DM tables and Analytics tables (resolution in progress). The key learning here is that some customers may not be aware that their CRM Advanced Sync was \'auto turned on\', but the ROI product will make this obvious. This is something for us to be mindful of and ensure that we are covered from a legal perspective on what we sync and how.

**Progress - GTM Data Store Migration Issue Resolved But Testing Timeline Extended:** Arun\'s team fixed the DevOps issue blocking GTM Data Store migration---the problem was with loading data into SingleStore after 20-30 minute runs, and the team now has the data pre-aggregating correctly. The cutover for beta customers is planned for mid-next week, but the extended troubleshooting means the team needs about a month of validation testing after cutover, pushing the GA release target to January instead of the original December 9 timeline. For the M4 Self-Serve Analytics work, Arun enabled the capability in two tenants in the pre-production environment and is collecting feedback from AMs and CSMs.

**Strategic Challenges - Workbook, Workspace, and AI Credits ROI Trending Red for January Due to Dependency Team Prioritization:** The team is trending red on January delivery for ROI across Workbook, Workspace, Agentic Chat, and AI Credits because four dependency teams haven\'t committed timelines despite having complete gap analysis and all dependency tickets created in Jira. The Agentic Chat team explicitly confirmed they can\'t prioritize the instrumentation work until end of November, while Workbook and Workspace teams haven\'t provided any timeline for when they can pick up their portions. The P0 blockers are clear: for Workbooks, the team needs a copy of BigTable data moved to Snowflake or ZDP (resolving this would unblock 99% of the work), and for Workspace, more than half of the CTAs are missing Amplitude instrumentation while views-related data needs moving to Snowflake/ZDP. Additionally, 60% of workspace metrics aren\'t persisted in the backend, forcing reliance on Amplitude events which creates hit-or-miss data quality. Arun is scheduling a call with Adam, Lars, Ryan, and Jessie this week to review requirements for Agentic Chat, Credits, and Workspace, which should surface remaining gaps and drive commitment from source PM and engineering teams for CFA to meet the January timeline.

**Data Management**

**Progress - V2 Data Health Scan Validates with Customers While Front-End Development Kicks Off:** Corina\'s team shipped V2 of the Data Health Scan proof of concept this week, which matches exactly what will be built in GTM Studio and enables deep metric validation with real customer data before production development. The team met with multiple customers and internal stakeholders, receiving strong validation with no surprising feedback---customers confirmed the metrics are directionally correct, and the focus shifted to QA-ing the actual data calculations against what customers see in their CRMs. Front-end resources from Denis Levkov\'s team are now identified and kicked off development work for the Data Health Scan in GTM Studio. For Milestone 5 (AI Onboarding), Corina finalized the steel-thread narrative showing the end-to-end flow where customers see the Data Health Scan, purchase data management, experience AI-assisted onboarding for initial configuration setup, then return weeks later to see new issues in the Data Health Scan and get AI help addressing them---all connecting with Ash\'s M4 configuration and job execution work.

**Strategic Challenges - Filtering Capability Already Being Built by Platform Team for Multi-Subsidiary Customers (No additional action required):** The biggest learning from customer validation was that some customers like Randstad have multiple subsidiaries (Randstad Nevada, Randstad Canada, Pareto Law) using the same CRM but with different ZoomInfo tenant IDs, and they only want to see data for their specific subsidiary in the Data Health Scan. Andres\' team is already building this filtering capability in the Advanced Sync section, so once available, the Data Health Scan will automatically show only companies and contacts related to the customer\'s specific tenant based on their filtering configuration. The team just needs to QA and test this capability when it ships, but no additional work is required since the platform team has this handled. This reinforces that as the product scales, having robust filtering at the platform level prevents each feature team from building one-off solutions.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Enterprise Customers Want More Flexibility, Not Less, as They Scale with Data Management:** Meeting with internal RingLead users and Matt Williams this week revealed that as customers become more confident with data management capabilities, they actually want to fine-tune their matching logic more precisely rather than accept out-of-the-box configurations. This contradicts the common assumption that RingLead is \"too flexible\" and challenges suggestions to make everything completely automated with no configuration options. IBM discussions reinforced this pattern---the most sophisticated enterprise data management teams at companies investing millions into their data practice appreciate the ability to perfect their matching rules. The implication for AI Data Management is clear: the MVP onboarding can guide mid-market customers through best-practice configurations, but the long-term product must preserve flexibility for enterprise customers to customize as they mature, balancing complexity with usability rather than sacrificing one for the other.

**Plays Must Solve Orchestration, Not Just Provide Another AI-Powered Spreadsheet:** Running numerous sales calls over the past two weeks with the new platform narrative validated that the go-to-market AI platform story is landing well with customers, but a clear gap emerged on the operations side. Sneh observed that when the team shows up with Studio\'s audience-building capabilities, customers see another AI-powered spreadsheet rather than true orchestration capabilities that close the loop on their workflows. The feedback reinforces why getting plays into production quickly matters---customers need to see how Studio doesn\'t just build lists but actually orchestrates actions across their go-to-market systems. This insight is driving the team\'s focus on ensuring the January early access release includes meaningful activation patterns beyond basic exports, with preview and governance experiences that demonstrate true workflow automation rather than just data preparation.

**DoubleO Workflows Don\'t Support True Test Runs, Requiring New Preview Experience Design:** Design workshops for plays revealed that DoubleO workflows lack proper test run capabilities today, creating a wonky experience when customers want to validate automation with dummy inputs before executing on full datasets. Mohan\'s team is designing new preview flows that show results for the first 10 records so users can fine-tune play configurations before committing credits and running full-scale jobs. Additionally, the team decided that for one-off workflows with fixed datasets, filtering capabilities should remain on the input side (workbooks) while plays focus purely on orchestration steps, rather than mixing data preparation with execution logic. This architectural decision keeps concerns properly separated and ensures plays can scale to support multiple input sources beyond workbooks without creating tangled dependencies.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

**ROI Analytics Needs Source Team Prioritization for January Workbook, Workspace, and AI Credits Instrumentation:** Arun\'s team has complete gap analysis done and all dependency tickets created in Jira for Workbook, Workspace, Agentic Chat, and AI Credits ROI, but four source teams haven\'t committed timelines for the instrumentation work needed to hit the January release. The Agentic Chat team explicitly stated they can\'t prioritize until end of November, while Workbook and Workspace teams haven\'t provided any dates. The specific P0 blockers are: (1) Workbooks needs BigTable data copied to Snowflake/ZDP which would unblock 99% of the work, (2) Workspace needs Amplitude instrumentation for more than half of CTAs plus views-related data moved to Snowflake/ZDP, and (3) 60% of workspace metrics aren\'t persisted in backend, forcing reliance on hit-or-miss Amplitude events. Arun is scheduling a meeting this week with Adam, Lars, Ryan, and Jessie to review requirements and surface remaining gaps, but the team needs explicit prioritization commitments from Jagannath for Workbooks, Sean and Adam for Workspace, and Lars for Agentic Chat to meet the January timeline.

**Semantic Enrichment Coverage Issues Require Root Cause Investigation from Search Team:** Jagannath\'s team continues encountering coverage problems with semantic enrichment where only 50-60% of requests return results, even for accounts where conversation intelligence data definitely exists (like Alex Lazer\'s accounts that have documented conversations but semantic queries came back empty). The team spent 6-7 hours building the studio-on-studio marketing campaign list for RNG and encountered numerous blockers with semantic not returning expected results, forcing workarounds through the UI. The technical troubleshooting is complex and visibility into root causes remains limited, creating concern that if the product team struggles to understand why semantic fails, customers will find it even harder to diagnose. Jagannath needs Rowan\'s search engineering team to investigate the pipeline and surface where coverage breaks down, plus define clear expectations for what match rates customers should expect so the product team can set proper expectations rather than promising capabilities that don\'t consistently deliver.

**Looking Ahead**

**Next Week Centers on Bethesda Onsite to Align Plays Architecture and Audience Building Integration:** The team is converging in Bethesda for a focused working session to drive alignment on two foundational questions for plays: (1) the technical architecture for how agentic platforms come together to support orchestration, and (2) the product experience for audience building through plays where list creation should always route through Studio\'s workbook capabilities rather than plays pulling data directly from sources like CRM reports. Jagannath, Mohan, Karthik, Ryan, and Adam will workshop the agentic orchestration engine integration, while the broader team will prototype how audience building interfaces with plays to create an end-to-end flow from list creation through activation. Sneh is focused on getting crystal clear sign-off on exactly which plays the team will support first and ensuring everyone is locked in on those priorities coming out of the onsite.

**ROI Analytics Dependency Alignment and Data Management Design Reviews Dominate the Week:** Arun is driving meetings with Adam, Lars, Ryan, and Jessie to review instrumentation requirements for Agentic Chat, Workspace, and AI Credits, with the goal of surfacing all remaining gaps and securing timeline commitments from source teams to unblock the January delivery. For Data Management, Brahm\'s focus is conducting design reviews across both M4 foundational capabilities with Ash and M5 AI onboarding with Corina, ensuring Brandon Tucker\'s team and other internal stakeholders provide feedback on the resolution screen and ideal user journey work. Corina continues circulating the V2 Data Health Scan to prioritized accounts and AMs for validation, while front-end development progresses on bringing the scan into GTM Studio for the January demo date.

**Plays M2 Scope Finalization and Front-End Implementation Approach Drive Toward January Readiness:** Mohan\'s team is iterating on preview and governance experience designs based on workshop feedback, with continued design reviews scheduled with product leaders to lock in the enhanced M2 scope that includes test run capabilities, credit consumption controls, and notification flows beyond basic workbook-to-play activation. The team is also finalizing the front-end implementation approach (React versus Angular) now that the decision to send users to a dedicated plays area rather than an overlay experience provides clearer technical direction. Architecture reviews continue with Tushar, Michael, and the DoubleO dev team to ensure the design scales beyond early milestones to support data orchestration across different app areas. Neha is working through the outreach integration to have it in staging by Tuesday, completing the framework for adding prospects to sequences and enabling email functionality that rounds out the M1 tools library.

## **Data Executive Team Weekly Report - November 10-14, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

ByteMine mobile phone infusions exceeded targets by 78%, successfully pushing 3.5M records into production with PTI resolving a critical processing bug that had been causing bottlenecks. Brandon Tucker is leading a hands-on effort to democratize dataset onboarding through GTM Studio, walking the GitHub dataset through the process to identify friction points and building AI agents to automate documentation. The team is addressing a growing confusion among sales about Company Master vs traditional matching, which is creating unnecessary friction in customer conversations and requiring immediate enablement with Yixing\'s team. Ethan Young\'s Company 3.0 testing environments are now operational, marking the first phase of validating the new pipeline\'s matching capabilities.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Dana Hurtig\'s team achieved 178% of their ByteMine mobile phone infusion goal, processing 3.5M records and working closely with PTI to resolve source ranking issues for alternate mobiles and freemails. The collaboration with PTI uncovered and fixed a processing bug that had been creating queue bottlenecks, enabling faster throughput going forward, and resulting in a total of 7.7M data infusions (including Bytemine) for the week. The team is also testing two promising new data sources: a WhatsApp API for mobile validation and Surf, which is delivering 75-80% hit rates on previously missing mobile phones.

Brandon Tucker completed preparation for next week\'s waterfall hackathon and built the first AI agent to automate dataset onboarding documentation, successfully generating a comprehensive one-pager for the GitHub dataset in minutes. This represents a critical step toward democratizing the onboarding process, potentially enabling the team to add 100+ datasets next year by removing the bottleneck of manual documentation and analysis that currently lives in the heads of platform team members.

Igor Kyrylenko completed acquisition of 29 states for professional licenses data and initiated FOIA requests for automotive dealerships and building permits across major jurisdictions. The team has already received 11 states of automotive dealership data and sent requests to 67 of the largest municipalities for construction permit data. This represents 72% U.S. population coverage for professional licenses and establishes a natural competitive barrier, as acquiring and normalizing data from 50+ disparate state systems requires significant time and resources that competitors would struggle to replicate.

**Goals & Progress**

**Mobile Phone & Contact Coverage:** ByteMine processing reached 178% of weekly targets with 3.5M mobile phones infused, including successful implementation of alternate mobile and freemail rankings to prevent overwriting existing data. The team validated source rankings with PTI and is ramping up processing for the remaining ByteMine dataset. New contact creation from unpublished ByteMine and 5x5 profiles is under review with testing ongoing for WhatsApp validation (checking mobile availability for messaging) and Surfe data source (75-80% fill rate on missing mobiles). 2.7M ProgAI enrichments completed at 100% of goal, with 600K ByteMine freemails and 300K Rhetorik contact creations pending completion. Bad data fixes reached 1.3M records, 87% of target for the week.

**Company 3.0 Pipeline Testing:** Ethan Young successfully set up and tested initial Company 3.0 environments with both bootstrapped (pre-populated) and blank Solr indexes operational for comparative matching analysis. The team identified several infrastructure needs including bulk record submission scripts, expanded matching traces in BigQuery for both environments, and pathways to source test records from Company 2.0 and other data sources. Company Master API replacement testing is progressing well with strong matching logic results, positioning the team to deprecate EverString API within weeks. The team is building tools to send test sets efficiently and developing comprehensive test plans for both new company creation flow and existing profile migration scenarios.

**GTM Studio & Dataset Onboarding:** Brandon Tucker walked the GitHub dataset through the onboarding process to identify bottlenecks and documentation gaps, building an AI agent that generates comprehensive dataset one-pagers by interviewing users through voice recording. The agent successfully produced a complete reference document in less time than it took to build, demonstrating a path to scale dataset contributions across teams. Preparation for next week\'s waterfall working session is complete, with the goal of producing functional capabilities rather than just plans. The team is addressing confusion in sales about Company Master vs traditional ZoomInfo matching, as sellers are inadvertently using both approaches simultaneously and getting inconsistent results, requiring urgent enablement with Yixing\'s team.

**Strategic Challenges**

Sales teams fundamentally misunderstand the distinction between Company Master (location-based matching) and traditional ZoomInfo matching (HQ-based), leading to sellers running the same data through both systems and then questioning why results differ. Multiple instances emerged this week of customers using both approaches simultaneously---integrating traditional match service through CRM Enrich while doing offline enrichment with Company Master---creating confusion about data quality and match accuracy. The issue has escalated to the point where sellers are running name-and-address-only matching through Company Master while simultaneously enriching on domain through traditional systems, even when domain data is available. This requires immediate coordinated enablement with Yixing\'s team and potentially a company all-hands communication, as the lack of understanding is creating unnecessary friction in customer conversations and undermining confidence in matching capabilities. Brandon Tucker noted that sellers need clear guidance on when to use each approach and that Data Services should begin qualifying use cases before running match requests.

The swapper.exe degradation timeline for April 2026 presents a significant strategic challenge as Windows 11 and new Outlook versions will no longer support the executable approach, forcing migration to web-based authentication or Microsoft Store plugins. The plugin option faces high barriers to entry requiring admin approval for installation, making it largely a non-starter for scaled adoption. The historical top-of-funnel approach---driving non-customers to directory pages to install Swapper and contribute signatures---has consistently failed to scale despite attribution data showing signature sources were historically the largest contributor to new emails and phones. Jody Roberts is coordinating a multi-team response with Heather Ma and TPM support from Ina, focusing on a multi-pronged email strategy encompassing validation, threat detection, send optimization, and new acquisition methods. The team needs creative solutions for signature data acquisition beyond the legacy PLG model, as AI disruption of search and inbound traffic is fundamentally changing how people discover and interact with directory pages. Ethan Young raised concerns about urgency given zippy data\'s criticality to core contact data, though Brandon Tucker noted the challenge is less about prioritization and more about identifying viable alternative approaches when the obvious technical path isn\'t available.

PTI processing bottlenecks resolved after extended back-and-forth revealed an underlying bug rather than just capacity constraints, though the discovery process highlighted the need for more direct escalation paths for high-impact data infusion work. Dana Hurtig\'s team experienced delays processing ByteMine data as records sat in queues that appeared as timeouts but were actually just backlogged. Jody Roberts and Brandon Tucker reinforced with Kristen and Ritu that mobile phone accuracy and fill rate improvements represent the highest-impact opportunity available and should receive all-hands support, as this is the easiest and most valuable work the team can do. The resolution of the bug and increased PTI responsiveness over recent days suggests the message is landing, though sustained attention will be needed to maintain momentum as the team processes the remaining 99M ByteMine records and additional data sources. The situation underscores the organizational challenge of ensuring data quality and coverage work receives the same urgency as product feature development.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

ZoomInfo\'s search infrastructure and referential dataset represent a massive competitive moat that the business struggles to articulate to technical buyers, as demonstrated in this week\'s conversation with BCG consultants who dismissed GTM Studio as just another tool they could build themselves via APIs. Brandon Tucker identified that most companies fail to understand three critical components: the search infrastructure required to query across dozens of disparate datasets at scale, the 20 years of accumulated alt domains and alt names that power nuanced matching logic, and the power of having a single authoritative referential dataset that eliminates the need for exponential cross-matching (matching 30 datasets to each other requires thousands of match operations versus matching each to one canonical dataset which provides unified profile automatically). Technical buyers understand that individual matching algorithms are straightforward but miss the supporting infrastructure around location normalization, address parsing, and derived geography relationships that enable ZoomInfo to match successfully even with incomplete input data. The team needs customer-facing materials that can explain this to MDM-type technical audiences, as the current pitch fails to resonate despite representing genuine technical advantages competitors would take years and significant investment to replicate.

Clay\'s only sustainable advantage in waterfall enrichment is their established integrations, not their data quality or vendor portfolio, which consists largely of unknown Tier D providers that customers aren\'t loyal to. Brandon Tucker\'s analysis revealed Clay charges 14 credits per mobile phone enrichment at 1.5-5.5 cents per credit (up to 50 cents per contact), and customers must pay again for every data refresh. ZoomInfo\'s record-under-management model provides free refreshes for a year, creating a massive pricing advantage once waterfall capabilities launch. Additionally, Clay lacks a frontline activation solution and has weaker core data, meaning ZoomInfo should win most competitive situations through superior data quality, better integrations, consumption-friendly pricing, and AI credits at commodity rates. The key learning is that waterfall isn\'t about matching Clay\'s exact vendor list but rather demonstrating superior match rates at lower cost with better refresh economics and integration into the broader ZoomInfo platform.

Professional licenses and vertical datasets create natural competitive barriers because acquiring data from 50 states plus DC is expensive and time-consuming, making it hard for competitors to replicate even though individual state data is technically accessible. Igor Kyrylenko noted that while anyone could theoretically build 100 APIs to collect this data, it would cost approximately \$200,000 in human labor and take 6 months, creating a meaningful first-mover advantage. The request-based nature of FOIA processes means that once ZoomInfo establishes collection systems and maintains them, the ongoing effort is significantly lower than the initial build. These datasets differentiate ZoomInfo in ways that matter to specific customer segments---professional licenses expanding beyond contractors, automotive dealerships, construction permits---and the structured nature of government-mandated data ensures consistency and authority that proprietary datasets lack. The learning reinforces that vertical dataset strategy should focus on government-mandated or otherwise regulated data sources where acquisition difficulty serves as a natural moat.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Work with PTI on ByteMine data processing evolved from adversarial to collaborative after identifying that perceived capacity constraints were actually a bug causing queue backlog. Dana Hurtig\'s team maintained constant communication with PTI to surface issues in real-time, leading to the discovery and resolution of the underlying problem. The experience highlights the importance of sustained engagement rather than one-time escalation when processing large-scale data infusions. Going forward, the team needs clear prioritization signals from leadership when mobile phone and contact data work should receive maximum support, as Brandon Tucker\'s message to Kristen and Ritu emphasized this represents the highest-impact opportunity available. Future large-scale infusions (remaining 99M ByteMine records, 5x5 data, Surf data) will require similar coordination, and establishing clearer escalation paths would prevent delays in future processing.

Coordination with Yixing\'s enablement team is needed immediately to address sales confusion about Company Master versus traditional ZoomInfo matching, as the problem has escalated beyond individual cases to a systemic misunderstanding. Multiple sellers are using both approaches simultaneously without understanding why they get different results or when to use each approach. The team needs to create clear documentation differentiating location-based versus HQ-based matching and establish guidelines for Data Services to qualify use cases before running matches. Brandon Tucker, Dana Hurtig, and Ethan Young will develop materials for Yixing\'s team to deploy first to sellers, potentially followed by broader company communication. The dependency is time-sensitive as ongoing confusion undermines customer confidence in matching accuracy and creates unnecessary support burden.

Brandon Wilson\'s deal cycle insights agent requires the contributory network flag to be accessible in ZDP and stage normalization to be automated, with timelines from Jesse Lundstrom and Ron Kadneau indicating mid-December for the CN flag. Steve Hutchinson confirmed that stage normalization is not actively being worked on and is second priority behind other initiatives, meaning Brandon Wilson will need to manually run Shauna\'s normalization process in the near term. The dependency highlights the challenge of building on top of GTM Store infrastructure that\'s still being developed, though Brandon Wilson has identified workarounds to maintain progress. Heather Ma is collaborating on the 100-day-to-production plan for the agent, with the team developing temporary solutions that can be swapped for automated processes once dependencies are resolved.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on the waterfall hackathon working session where the team aims to produce functional capabilities rather than plans, building on Brandon Tucker\'s preparation work and GitHub dataset onboarding documentation. Dana Hurtig\'s team will continue ramping ByteMine processing for the remaining dataset, pushing forward with freemail infusions and exploring new contact creation from unpublished profiles in ByteMine and 5x5. The team is finalizing testing of WhatsApp validation and Surf data sources to determine whether to integrate them into production workflows.

Ethan Young will build tools to efficiently send test records to Company 3.0 environments and identify appropriate test sets for both new company creation and existing profile migration, writing comprehensive test plans to guide the matching validation work. Brandon Wilson will implement temporary solutions for the CN flag and stage normalization in his deal cycle insights agent pipeline, building aggregate tables to support demo scenarios for the upcoming board meeting. Igor Kyrylenko will complete professional licenses normalization and deliver statistical breakdowns for waiting clients, while continuing to process incoming automotive dealership data from FOIA requests across the 67 targeted municipalities.

The team must move quickly on Company Master versus ZoomInfo matching enablement materials with Yixing, as ongoing confusion in sales is creating friction in customer conversations and undermining confidence in data quality. Jody Roberts will continue coordinating the swapper degradation response with Heather Ma and TPM Ina, developing the multi-pronged email strategy and exploring alternative signature data acquisition approaches. The waterfall hackathon represents a critical milestone in democratizing dataset onboarding and accelerating ZoomInfo\'s ability to compete with Clay\'s vendor integrations, while the Company 3.0 testing marks the beginning of validating the next-generation pipeline that will ultimately replace current matching infrastructure.

## **SalesOS/Copilot Team Weekly Report - November 10-14, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Sean Walter is preparing for three-week paternity leave (starting Nov. 20th) and completing handoff documentation for critical Copilot Workspace initiatives. The team achieved important momentum on Pulses with a 4,000-seller survey launched and Next Best Actions (NBA) agent now live in production via the Orchestrator. However, backend capacity constraints---particularly on the apps team absorbed by GTM Data Model POC work---threaten December delivery timelines for artifacts and chat-to-views functionality that Victor identified as essential for demonstrating Workspace\'s 10x value over Copilot V1.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Copilot Workspace Pulses validation accelerates with field research. Ant is planning to distribute a comprehensive survey to a 4,000 frontline sellers this week covering pulse types, alert preferences, and configurability requirements. This field validation ensures Pulses---the keystone initiative for Workspace---solves real seller needs rather than assumed requirements. The team is using both quantitative survey data and qualitative voice feedback through Vapi to validate the 40+ out-of-the-box pulse concepts currently defined. Ant also conducted deep-dive sessions with Sri on signal gaps and with Robyn and Carlos on flexible account prioritization scoring (APS), addressing major gaps that limited Copilot V1 adoption. He also shared a comprehensive document framing the problem, gaps, and suggested approaches to take for full coverage of ownership/territory and signal weighting by persona.

ZoomInfo Intent strategy advances with Zero Config architecture and enablement materials. Harinath completed a comprehensive one-pager and prototype for AI-powered Sales Enablement within Copilot Workspace, secured stakeholder alignment on Zero Config requirements with the GTM Offering team (meeting scheduled with Aditya), and continued LLM-as-judge validation work for Intent Recommendation quality improvements. While the primary Data Science contact remains on PTO, Harinath\'s evaluation framework successfully identified specific Intent signal categories where recommendations excel versus areas needing improvement, providing actionable input for Phase 1 enhancements once the team reconvenes.

Admin Zero Experience makes final preparations for production release. David\'s Admin Defined Territories feature pushed final UI tweaks to production staging, targeting Monday/Tuesday feature flag opening for the main November release. The team completed Info Packs documentation and additional upload templates while working through MCP integration to open territories into the agentic layer. David also advanced Priority Accounts work with initial UX designs for CRM rules socialized across the Context team, though progress was slowed by urgent customer escalations requiring developer attention.

**Goals & Progress**

**Copilot Workspace:** The team made significant strides across multiple fronts this week. Gabe addressed bulk emailer technical dependencies and created a one-pager proposing an alternative approach after learning the task queue dependency will prevent meeting December timelines. Adam took over the Workspace Agent standup from Lars, analyzed 20+ failure points in chat accuracy, and moved Priority Fields work toward completion (targeting hotfix deployment shortly after the 11/18 release). Dylan built five new artifact templates with Jen\'s review, made progress on Brand Fetch POC for corporate slide branding, and navigated Cisco\'s Gong iframe escalation by identifying technical limitations requiring Gong product work. The homepage refresh went live Monday with improved pill adoption, and Ant successfully connected the NBA sub-agent to the Orchestrator---a major milestone delivering far superior output compared to the previous implementation.

**ZoomInfo Intent:** Harinath completed multiple deliverables including the Sales Enablement one-pager with prototype, Zero Config requirements document, and LLM-as-judge evaluation framework for Intent Recommendation Phase 2. The main blocker remains the Data Science contact\'s PTO preventing final alignment on quality enhancement priorities, but comprehensive analysis has been completed and shared. Harinath also met with Aditya from the Offerings team to finalize GTM Config alignment for Intent clusters and Account Fit Score (AFS), identifying key misalignments around offering limits that require strategic discussion with Victor about how to support unlimited offerings when downstream features have restrictions.

**Admin Zero Experience:** David completed final Admin Portal UI tweaks for Admin Defined Territories, which are now in staging and ready for Monday/Tuesday feature flag opening. The MCP work to open territories into the agentic layer continues but faced delays due to urgent Workbooks tasks and KTLO issues---expected to resume next week. On Priority Accounts, David made meaningful progress prototyping CRM matching rules using the new GraphQL interface from GTM Data Model, though the Context team (Robyn, Ardi) is pursuing a different approach using AI to work through CRM data, creating a need to align on how both approaches work together for customers with and without CRM data.

**Additional Initiatives:** Mobile development continues progressing toward the December 1st internal alpha, with native chat implementation nearly complete and the team making strong design progress with Katya. Gabe\'s sequences work hit a temporary slowdown due to platform dependencies on Plays/Pulses, but he\'s coordinating with Adam Smith on roadmap reassessment. Dylan advanced forecasting prototypes based on last week\'s session with Jen and initiated conversations about CSS branded guides for artifacts leveraging the Brand Fetch API. Victor spent significant time demoing to customers and sales leaders, gathering firsthand friction points---the key insight being that Workspace must demonstrably show 10x improvement over Copilot V1 to justify AI action credit expansion, with studio-to-workspace activation emerging as the most successful demo despite not being polished yet.

**Strategic Challenges**

Backend engineering capacity constraints threaten December artifact and chat-to-views delivery. The apps team\'s most senior engineers are heavily absorbed by the GTM Data Model POC, creating a significant bottleneck for critical Workspace features. Ryan Stevens\' team is working on bulk emailer, chat-to-views, and other initiatives that Victor identified as essential for demonstrating Workspace\'s value, but capacity limitations forced Sean to pull back on some view improvements and non-urgent user feedback. The chat-to-views functionality is particularly important since \"the feed\" continues to be the most coveted demo path despite known utilization issues, and while Pulses represents the long-term solution, an intermediate \"feed/artifact\" view of Views could address sales team feedback in the near term. Sean will need conversations with Nebo and Ryan to clarify what can conceivably be delivered by year-end.

Orchestrator platform transition introduces latency concerns for chat accuracy improvements. The 00 team\'s supervisor agent architecture with sub-agents is expected to deliver quantum leap improvements in chat accuracy and reasoning, but this comes at the cost of increased latency due to the additional supervisor step. Sean shared Workspace\'s set of key queries with the 00 team, but the team needs to understand latency expectations for common queries like \"tell me about Dominic Fasher\"---will responses take 10 seconds, 35 seconds, or longer? Adam is working to establish current baseline performance and will need to collaborate closely with the 00 team to ensure the UI experience remains best-in-class as accuracy improves. This tradeoff between reasoning capability and response speed requires careful product decisions about which queries warrant the supervisor overhead.

Data Science program management gaps slow Intent AI improvement velocity. Both Ant and Harinath noted difficulties with Data Science follow-ups and tracking, with Harinath specifically blocked this week by a key contact on PTO. Sean suggested exploring program management support to help coordinate the numerous Data Science initiatives (Intent recommendations, APS integration, chat accuracy improvements, NBA quality) without creating a heavyweight process. The team needs someone to help manage the growing backlog of Data Science requests, track deliverables, and maintain momentum across multiple workstreams. Harinath\'s successful LLM-as-judge evaluation framework and comprehensive Phase 3 Intent AI requirements demonstrate the quality of product-side preparation, but execution velocity depends on Data Science capacity and coordination.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Studio-to-Workspace activation resonates strongly with customers despite lacking polish. Victor\'s field research this week revealed that the most successful demo is the studio-to-workspace activation flow, which generated over 100 meetings booked in Laser\'s org alone. Sales leaders are \"incredibly excited\" about this capability not because it\'s flashy or polished---it\'s not yet---but because it resonates with their customers\' actual workflows. This validates the platform convergence strategy and suggests the team should prioritize making this activation path reliable and repeatable over investing in purely cosmetic improvements. The customer resonance indicates this workflow solves a real pain point around operationalizing GTM intelligence, making it a higher-leverage investment than many other features currently in flight.

Workspace value demonstration requires showing 10x improvement over Copilot V1 to justify AI action credits. Victor\'s customer conversations revealed the core challenge: Copilot Enterprise customers aren\'t charged AI action credits for V1 functionality (creating emails, asking account questions), which enabled many deals to close. Now that Workspace requires AI action credits, customers and sellers need to see dramatically better capabilities to justify both the new cost model and the risk of adopting AI in enterprise contexts. Victor emphasized this isn\'t about incremental improvement---it requires side-by-side screenshots where users say \"this is 10x better, totally worth the AI action credits.\" This frames December roadmap prioritization: features must demonstrably advance the \"why Workspace is 10x better than V1\" narrative or address critical workflow blockers preventing users from experiencing that value.

Early chat accuracy improvements show promise but require systematic testing frameworks. Adam\'s takeover of the Workspace Agent standup and analysis of 20+ failure points revealed that current testing relies heavily on \"vibe testing\" rather than robust evaluation frameworks. While Carlos and Ryan\'s eval framework should be finalized within days, the lack of production testing access creates inefficiencies. Adam noted that many problems only manifest with real production data and complex CRM scenarios, suggesting the team needs better tooling for engineers and PMs to test against realistic customer configurations. The move toward giving Adam direct access to Langsmith playgrounds for rapid prompt iteration addresses this, but it highlights a broader need for production-representative testing environments.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Data Science on Intent AI improvements and APS integration continues to be essential for competitive differentiation against 6sense and DemandBase. Harinath shared comprehensive LLM-as-judge evaluation results identifying specific quality improvement opportunities, but final alignment on Phase 2 implementation roadmap is blocked by the primary contact\'s PTO. Ant\'s work on account prioritization for Pulses requires close coordination with Robyn\'s team, whose APS approach that may not fully address Workspace use cases spanning territory managers with 2,000 accounts to named account managers with 15 enterprise accounts. Sean suggested exploring dedicated sync time or program management support to improve Data Science coordination velocity without creating heavyweight process overhead.

The GTM Data Model integration represents both a major opportunity and a significant capacity constraint. Andres and the platform team showed enthusiasm for solving previously discussed gaps around write-backs and field access, with the POC appearing feasible for December delivery. However, this work is absorbing the apps team\'s most senior engineers---the same people on the critical path for chat improvements, bulk emailer, and chat-to-views. Sean, Gabe, and Adam all noted this bottleneck, with Sean emphasizing the need for a consolidated list of GTM Data Model requirements and a view of how this looks across the application. David\'s Priority Accounts work depends on understanding how to federate GTM Data Model with Advanced Search, adding another layer of coordination complexity.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s primary focus centers on finalizing November 18th release preparations while managing Sean\'s upcoming paternity leave handoff. The team will complete final testing and smoke checks for Admin Defined Territories production deployment, finish Priority Fields work for post-release hotfix, and ensure Dylan\'s artifact templates and Brand Fetch integration are ready for customer-facing release.

Critical path items include: (1) Sean completing his three-week handoff documentation by end of week with individual PM conversations already scheduled; (2) Ant delivering the end-to-end Pulses steel thread showing day-one experience, system learning, user pulse creation, and admin pulse integration from Studio; (3) Adam finalizing the create view experience designs for engineering handoff; (4) Gabe\'s one-pager on bulk emailer alternative approach to enable quick proof-of-concept work; and (5) Victor, Ant, and the broader team aligning on the Pulses vision in tomorrow\'s meeting to ensure unified execution.

December delivery depends on resolving backend capacity constraints and making hard prioritization decisions. Sean\'s conversations with Nebo and Ryan about feasible December scope need to happen soon, particularly around artifacts/aha moments, workbook activation, and chat-to-views---the features Victor identified as most important for renewal conversations. The team must balance the long-term architectural work (GTM Data Model integration, Orchestrator platform migration) against near-term features that demonstrate Workspace\'s 10x value proposition. With Sean out for three weeks starting November 20th, clear ownership of these prioritization decisions and the ability to make pragmatic scope tradeoffs will be essential for maintaining momentum through year-end.

## **Intelligence Team Weekly Report - November 10-14, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team achieved a major cost breakthrough this week with 60% reduction in LLM costs through prompt caching implementation, though this savings isn\'t yet passed to customers due to AI Credit Service limitations. Meanwhile, front-end design for the trigger experience is progressing with a newly assigned designer, and the first version of the orchestration platform (00) is ready for production deployment Monday with full M1 tool support. Critical architectural decisions around semantic data scalability are being evaluated with Milvus showing 2-3x performance gains over current solutions.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Ryan Stevens and Josh delivered a validated 60% cost reduction through prompt caching implementation in the Workspace agent, representing substantial progress toward board-level cost optimization commitments. The team established a reproducible methodology for measuring hallucination rates using Adam Severance\'s dataset, shifting focus from anecdotal 33% figures to rigorous evaluation frameworks that distinguish between true hallucinations and tool selection errors.

Derek Osgood shipped PRDs for admin panel, publishing path, and message broker service while bringing the first version of the orchestration platform (00) to production-ready status. The platform now supports full M1 tool functionality including ZoomInfo data queries, Outreach integration, and workbook creation capabilities, with QA validation complete on all core tools.

Ant\'s NBA (Next Best Action) agent launched in production as a sub-agent on the Copilot homepage, demonstrating the team\'s ability to enable PM-led agent development with minimal integration overhead. The agent analyzes recent account activity and provides one-click execution of recommended actions, establishing a replicable pattern for the no-code builder initiative Lars is resuming.

**Goals & Progress**

**GTM Configuration & Context Architecture:** Rowan Bailey made headway on GTM Config migration strategy, achieving alignment on new navigation structure and object model for transitioning from Copilot V1 to V2. The discussions surfaced philosophical tensions between target accounts (admin-defined lists) and account priority score (ML-driven recommendations) which still needs resolving / leadership input. 8% of semantic data records lack ZoomInfo Company IDs due to upstream Chorus matching limitations, creating retrieval blind spots that require investigation - these will be resolved by the semantic data team running their own matching logic & backfill.

**Plays & Triggers Development:** Srivatsa Marthi advanced trigger experience requirements with newly assigned designer Yoav, expecting first draft Monday. The architecture now separates audience definition into the \"run play\" step rather than trigger definition, clarifying the build-run-monitor workflow. Critical blocker remains around CDC event attributes---current WebSights events lack filtering capabilities needed to prevent volume overload, with ZDP team meeting scheduled to expand attribute schema.

**Semantic Data & Intelligence Layer:** Carlos Nunez revealed plans for Intelligence Layer API with Milvus as leading candidate for scalable vector search, supporting quantization schemes and tier fetching with sub-100ms retrieval even from disk. Venkata identified quick wins reducing BigQuery Vector Search costs by migrating from external tables to proper partitioned/sorted tables. The team continues evaluating against Google Vertex Vector Search per IE requirements, with James Guyer building an abstraction API to enable seamless backend swapping.

**Scoring & Recommendations:** Carlos Nunez and Robyn Sablosky will be working with the Advanced Search Service to expose scores using position-based classification rather than rank, with the current grading bands set at 90--100 (A+), 80--89 (A), 70--79 (B+), 60--69 (B), 40--59 (C), and 1--39 (D). Applied AI is reviewing global score distributions to confirm that the cutoffs behave as expected across tenants before finalizing the thresholds.

**Strategic Challenges**

Semantic data model upgrades face unexpected complexity as the team transitions to Sonnet 4.5 with updated ontology, observing significant drops in entity extraction volume without clear root cause. This requires investigation to ensure the latest models and ontology deliver expected improvements in context quality. Previous Haiku limitations around ID tracing and relationship mapping may warrant reassessment given recent model advances, as Lars suggested.

AI Credit Service cannot yet consume cached tokens, meaning the team\'s 60% cost reduction achievement isn\'t reflected in customer value or billing. Ryan Stevens initiated a project to enable proper token reporting, but this represents a gap between engineering wins and business outcomes that needs near-term resolution to fulfill board commitments on cost optimization.

Cross-UX orchestration resourcing remains unresolved despite Derek\'s progress on PRDs and platform readiness. The alignment needed between Agentic platform and orchestration engine requires dedicated engineering capacity beyond current allocations, creating potential bottleneck for December-January roadmap execution as multiple teams prepare to leverage the shared infrastructure.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The hallucination debate this week surfaced critical insights about evaluation rigor and organizational communication. Robyn\'s findings that 33% of failures involve hallucinations was misrepresented in executive summaries as \"33% of chats hallucinate\"---a significant distortion. Adam Smith articulated technical definitions distinguishing true hallucinations (novel tokens not in input, broken semantic links) from tool selection competency issues, emphasizing that most problems stem from the latter. The team\'s pivot to measuring error rates across the precision-to-hallucination spectrum using Adam Severance\'s dataset represents a maturation in evaluation methodology.

The Ant NBA agent integration validated the sub-agent delegation pattern at production scale. Ant independently built, burned in, and QA\'d the entire agent with minimal platform team involvement, demonstrating that the architecture successfully enables PM-led development. This model will inform the no-code builder Lars is resuming, where artifact creation automatically spins up isolated agents with configurable tools, templates, and instructions that integrate as sub-agents to SalesOS, Workspace, or Studio.

Vector database selection demands careful evaluation given long-term scaling implications. Adam Smith\'s experience implementing Pinecone, PGVector, and others highlighted tradeoffs: PGVector works well for fixed datasets with simple retrieval but struggles with clustering indexes and operational complexity at scale. Milvus\'s architecture-specific optimizations (GPU/TPU/x86 SIMD support) and comprehensive FAISS index support make it compelling despite operational complexity that deterred the IE team. The mandate for comparison against Google Vertex Vector Search reflects wise diligence before committing to infrastructure that must scale to millions of tenants.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Robyn\'s involvement in web search quality improvements adds another coordination point requiring clear ownership boundaries.

The ZDP team meeting scheduled today addresses the urgent CDC event attribute expansion needed for trigger filtering. Without additional attributes flowing through change events, the Plays system cannot filter WebSights visits by page or other criteria, forcing either unmanageable trigger volume or delayed launch. This dependency affects Srivatsa\'s front-end design completion and Derek\'s overall Plays delivery timeline.

The AI Credits team roadmap became highly pliable post-launch, creating opportunity to inject prompt caching token reporting requirements. Ryan Stevens\' scoping work should receive prioritization given board-level commitments around cost reduction, making this a strategic dependency worth elevating if resistance emerges.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on three critical convergence points: finalizing orchestration platform integration strategy, completing trigger experience design for engineering handoff, and advancing the evaluation framework to production readiness.

Lars, Derek, and Adam will clarify how the Agentic platform and orchestration engine unite, unblocking December-January roadmap execution across multiple dependent teams. Derek continues M1 tool expansion while Srivatsa closes trigger design with Yoav and resolves CDC attribute requirements with ZDP. Ryan Stevens delivers hallucination measurement methodology, Lauren demos evaluation framework capabilities, and the ChatKit team progresses on human-in-loop implementation after their inaugural week.

The team maintains momentum despite juggling architectural decisions with significant long-term implications---vector database selection, context service design, orchestration patterns---while shipping incremental improvements in cost, quality, and capability. The challenge ahead involves maintaining delivery cadence while ensuring foundational choices set the stage for scalable, maintainable growth through 2026.

## **Semantic Data Team Weekly Report - November 14, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team identified a significant data retrieval gap: approximately 8% of processed accounts (2,000-2,500 of 35,000) lack ZoomInfo company IDs, rendering their semantic data invisible to downstream consumers despite successful processing. This stems from upstream Chorus ingestion issues where transcripts arrive with Chorus IDs but without the corresponding ZoomInfo company mappings. The team has documented the complete debugging flow and is coordinating with the Chorus team to resolve the ID resolution pipeline. Concurrently, Jon is automating quality validation scripts to prevent similar issues from surfacing late, while Jun\'s onboarding accelerates the team\'s capacity for parallel investigation work.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Jon advanced pipeline observability by documenting and preparing to automate the quality validation scripts that currently run manually. These scripts check person-fragment matching, engagement completeness, and semantic data readiness across accounts. Moving them into Airflow will provide continuous visibility into data quality rather than point-in-time manual checks.

Rowan constructed a quick flow mapping the complete path from Chorus recording to semantic data retrieval, establishing a systematic framework for debugging customer \"semantic coverage\" issues. The flowchart identifies five distinct failure modes: missing source data, processing errors, 90-day lookback boundaries, ID type mismatches, and the newly discovered ZoomInfo company ID gaps.

Jun\'s environment setup accelerated through streamlined Docker container deployment. Jon resolved the historical Zscaler connectivity barriers, enabling full local development without AWS SSH workarounds. The team can now onboard new members in hours rather than days, with Jun positioned to contribute to testing and validation work immediately.

**Goals & Progress**

**Quality Metrics & Validation Infrastructure:** Jon has developed validation scripts that verify ontology compliance, relationship deduplication, and entity completeness at extraction time. The LLM validation layer logs warnings when extraction fails ontology constraints, ensuring only conformant data reaches the graph. The immediate focus shifts to automating these validations in Airflow for continuous monitoring rather than reactive investigation.

**ID Resolution & Data Accessibility:** The team discovered that 8% of accounts with processed semantic data cannot be retrieved by the agent because Chorus ingestion doesn\'t populate ZoomInfo company IDs. Investigation revealed these accounts have valid Chorus IDs and Salesforce IDs but lack the primary identifier used by Copilot, workbooks, and other downstream consumers. This requires coordination with the Chorus team to understand their company ID resolution process.

**Team Capability & Development Velocity:** The local development environment now supports full pipeline testing through Docker containers with MyPi, code formatting, and database hooks. Team members can validate specific engagements and recordings locally before PR deployment. Inga is testing pipeline errors directly, while Jun received environment variables and access keys to begin API testing and fragment analysis.

**Strategic Challenges**

The ZoomInfo company ID gap affects data discoverability in a way that\'s invisible to standard pipeline monitoring. Customers can see engagements in Chorus but receive empty responses from the semantic data agent, creating confusion about system functionality. Root cause analysis points to the Chorus-side ingestion process, where Salesforce account IDs should consistently map to ZoomInfo company IDs but don\'t. Venkata questioned whether processing transcripts without company IDs serves any purpose if the data becomes unretrievable, highlighting the need for upstream validation before processing resources are consumed.

Debugging complexity multiplies when failures can occur at five distinct stages, each requiring different diagnostic approaches. The team lacks a unified view of where accounts sit in the processing pipeline, making it difficult to quickly answer whether an account has processable data, whether processing succeeded, and whether extraction met quality thresholds. The accounts endpoint enhancement will address this by surfacing semantic data readiness status directly, but coordinating this visibility across teams remains a gap.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The team validated that quality controls exist at the right architectural layer---LLM extraction output gets validated against the ontology before any storage occurs, with non-conformant entities and relationships logged but not persisted. This prevents garbage data from polluting the graph, though it doesn\'t solve the upstream ID resolution problem. The validation scripts Jon maintains already check engagement completeness and person-fragment matching; automating them will shift the team from reactive investigation to proactive quality monitoring.

The 90-day lookback window creates a class of \"false negative\" scenarios where customers query accounts with legitimate engagements that predate the processing window. This isn\'t a bug but a design constraint that needs better communication to downstream consumers. Combined with the ID resolution issues, customers face two distinct reasons for \"no data found\" responses that appear identical on the surface but require completely different remediation paths.

Local development capability emerged as a force multiplier for team productivity. The six-month period when Jon worked exclusively through AWS SSH highlighted how infrastructure friction compounds across a team. Now that Zscaler connectivity works and Docker containers standardize the setup, new team members can validate changes locally within their first day, reducing iteration cycles and preventing environment-specific surprises in production.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Chorus team on ZoomInfo company ID resolution determines whether the 2,500 accounts with missing IDs become accessible or require reprocessing. The ingestion pipeline should consistently map Salesforce account IDs to ZoomInfo company IDs, but the current 8% failure rate suggests either gaps in Chorus\'s enrichment logic or data quality issues in their source systems. We need their team to investigate why certain accounts arrive with Chorus IDs and Salesforce IDs but no ZoomInfo company ID, and whether backfilling is possible without full reprocessing.

The Workbooks team depends on clear error messaging when semantic data queries fail. Currently they see empty results without context about whether the account lacks engagements entirely, has engagements outside the 90-day window, or has been processed but can\'t be retrieved due to ID mismatches. Enhanced status endpoints will help, but this requires alignment on what information Workbooks needs to handle these scenarios gracefully in their user experience.

**Looking Ahead**

The immediate priority centers on making data quality and processing status transparent rather than opaque. Jon will move quality validation scripts into Airflow for continuous monitoring, providing baseline metrics on fill rates, relationship quality, and processing success rates across tenants. This transforms quality from \"something we check when there\'s a problem\" to \"something we track continuously.\"

Resolving the ZoomInfo company ID gap requires coordination with Chorus to understand their enrichment process and determine whether backfilling is feasible. If backfilling isn\'t possible, we\'ll need to add validation that prevents processing transcripts without company IDs, since that data becomes effectively unusable by downstream consumers. The investigation should complete next week so we can decide between remediation strategies: reprocess with better ID mapping, build alternative retrieval paths, or implement upstream validation to stop the problem at ingestion.

Jun\'s ramp continues with local testing of specific API endpoints and fragment queries. As she builds familiarity with the codebase and validation approaches, the team gains parallel investigation capacity for the various edge cases surfacing in production. The Docker environment and Inga\'s testing framework provide a clear path for her to contribute to quality validation immediately while building deeper system understanding.

## **MCP Tiger Team Weekly Report - November 14, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team made substantial progress on MCP infrastructure fundamentals this week, with Topher delivering control plane functionality for server creation and Carter advancing the config server implementation. However, a security flagging issue with the ChatGPT connector has emerged as the primary blocker---OpenAI\'s systems are marking our integration as unsafe, and their lack of diagnostic visibility makes troubleshooting extremely difficult. We\'re pursuing both executive channels through Dominik and direct support routes, while Anthropic has granted us beta access to programmatic tool calling and tool search features that warrant near-term exploration.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Topher shipped control plane capabilities that enable dynamic MCP server management, including create/update operations, live version registration during server initialization, and a role/tag authorization system that properly filters tool access. This infrastructure unlocks the ability to programmatically manage our growing tool ecosystem rather than relying on manual configuration.

Carter deployed the config server shell to staging and established the foundation for passing map configuration into the gateway. While DevOps dependencies remain (GCS bucket creation and pub/sub topic setup), the service architecture is now in place and ready for self-service tooling once the infrastructure pieces land.

Zheng successfully tested the complete MCP flow with ZoomInfo\'s chatbot using the new gateway subdomain, validating that our core oauth2 works end-to-end. This proof point confirms our architectural approach even as we work through connector-specific challenges.

**Goals & Progress**

**MCP Infrastructure Build-out:** The control plane now supports full CRUD operations for MCP servers along with scope management separated from API scopes. Carter\'s config server is staged pending infrastructure provisioning (GCS bucket and pub/sub topic) from DevOps. The team expects Pat to deliver the required secrets and pub/sub setup, though the bucket creation depends on backstage service registration completing first.

**Third-Party Orchestration:** Zheng validated the ZoomInfo chatbot integration pattern successfully, but ChatGPT integration remains blocked by OpenAI\'s security scanning. The team is pursuing multiple remediation paths including potential contact escalation through Dominik\'s channels and direct developer account troubleshooting. The lack of diagnostic information from OpenAI makes systematic debugging impossible.

**Combined Tool Exploration:** Rowan initiated design work for tool aggregation patterns---combining related tools like \"lookup accounts\" and \"enrich accounts\" into unified interfaces that reduce choice complexity for LLMs. The team will hold a requirements session Monday to establish acceptance criteria for this work.

**Strategic Challenges**

OpenAI\'s ChatGPT connector is flagging our integration as unsafe with no diagnostic details about which specific elements triggered their security scan. We\'ve tried removing semantic data from descriptions without resolution, suggesting the issue may be broader in OpenAI\'s evaluation criteria. Rowan is exploring two parallel paths: leveraging Dominik\'s OpenAI contacts for direct technical escalation, and opening a developer support account to attempt standard troubleshooting channels. The challenge is compounded by OpenAI\'s forum-based support showing no concrete solutions for similar issues, and their apparent current focus on consumer rather than enterprise use cases despite maintaining robust enterprise connector documentation.

Carter has clear dependencies on DevOps infrastructure (GCS bucket creation, pub/sub topic configuration) that gate config server completion. While Pat is working on the secrets, the bucket requires backstage self-service tooling to work against the service that just deployed to staging. These infrastructure blockers are manageable but create sequencing constraints on delivery timing.

The team is resource-constrained for the scope of active work streams---building the gateway, exposing third-party orchestration, maintaining existing integrations, and now incorporating experimental work on new Anthropic capabilities. Rowan explicitly called out that the team needs dedicated time for pattern exploration and architecture validation alongside delivery commitments, particularly as the major LLM providers introduce new capabilities that could significantly improve our implementation approach.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Anthropic granted beta access to two capabilities that change our architectural calculus: programmatic tool calling and a built-in tool search function. The tool search feature is particularly relevant since we were planning to build similar functionality to handle tool discovery at scale. This suggests we should validate Anthropic\'s implementation pattern before building custom solutions---either adopting their approach directly or learning from their design to improve our own architecture. The timing is advantageous as we\'re still in active build phase rather than refactoring production code.

Tool visibility and selection is emerging as a strategic battleground beyond pure technical implementation. As Rowan noted, we\'re entering an era of \"agent attention\"---when orchestrators connect to dozens of potential tools, how do individual tools get selected and used? This has direct financial implications as companies implement credit charging for tool execution. Organizations that optimize for LLM attention and selection likelihood will generate more revenue, creating incentives for potentially adversarial behavior in tool metadata and descriptions.

The team validated that marking tools as \"searchable\" in MCP involves setting default loading to true, which means external orchestrators like Claude will load tools like HubSpot before performing tool search operations. This raises questions about whether we should implement tool search logic server-side within our gateway rather than client-side in the MCP server pattern, giving us more control over tool discovery and presentation ordering.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

DevOps needs to deliver GCS bucket creation and pub/sub topic configuration to unblock Topher\'s config server work. Pat is currently handling the secrets management portion. The self-service backstage tooling requires the service to exist first, which Carter deployed to staging this morning, so the dependency chain should resolve early next week.

Rowan is coordinating with Dominik on potential OpenAI contact escalation for the ChatGPT security issue. The team needs either diagnostic information about what\'s triggering the safety flags or a direct technical contact who can provide implementation guidance, as public forums show no viable solutions for similar connector blocking issues.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week the team continues core infrastructure delivery---Carter completing config server once DevOps dependencies land, then shifting to request routing and control plane support. Topher advances tool tagging and request routing capabilities while requiring API key creation support (already in progress with Pat). Zheng persists on ChatGPT connector resolution through both support channels and technical experimentation.

Monday\'s combined tool meeting will establish acceptance criteria for the tool aggregation pattern, which addresses LLM choice complexity by consolidating related operations into unified interfaces. This pattern work runs parallel to the potential MCP team office hours call where we can probe best practices, resource/prompt template support plans, and their roadmap for features that affect our architecture decisions.

The team faces a fundamental tension between delivery velocity and architectural validation. The new Anthropic capabilities (programmatic tool calling, tool search) warrant hands-on exploration before we lock in implementation patterns, yet the existing ticket backlog already exceeds current team capacity. Rowan will raise this resourcing and prioritization question in today\'s gateway API meeting with Dominik and Filip---we need explicit guidance on how to balance experimentation time against sprint commitments when the experimentation could fundamentally improve our long-term architecture.

Engineering refinement kickoff ensures DoubleO agents have necessary tools for successful launch.

**Strategic Challenges**

Documentation portal publishing proves more complex than anticipated, requiring Marc Frail to invest additional effort beyond initial expectations. The complexity likely relates to doing this the first time vs a core process problem.

Discovery flows remain undefined for GTM Studio, with Marc Frail noting that data connector discoverability within audience builder and GTM Studio can be improved. This UX gap affects how customers find and utilize available integration capabilities.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Component reusability accelerates no-code function development, as Sam Massie discovered that function builder work can leverage substantial existing infrastructure from data connectors and integrations. This architectural insight reduces development complexity while ensuring consistency across platform capabilities.

Enterprise data movement requirements differ from traditional workflow patterns, as website visit export to webhook capability demonstrates demand for automated data egress without UI interaction. This represents a distinct use case requiring different architectural approaches than traditional workflow orchestration.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Andres and integrations team coordination is essential for defining external views and connector discovery flows, ensuring appropriate customer-facing abstractions over implementation details.

Global Event Bus team synchronization continues for filtering and enrichment work, expanding event processing capabilities to support richer automation scenarios.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on formalizing enhancement roadmaps while refining function requirements with core engineering and completing analytics infrastructure work.

Marc Frail will formalize the outstanding data connector enhancement roadmap, consolidating insights from implementation experience into structured planning. He will resync with the Global Event Bus team on filtering and enrichment capabilities, coordinate with integrations team on connector discovery in audience builder and GTM Studio, and publish documentation for exposed data connectors to the developer portal.

Sam Massie will refine function requirements with the core engineering team, advancing beyond the apps team kickoff to ensure all platform components align on implementation approach and architectural patterns.

Adam Peretz will continue working on analytics capabilities, completing the data cleanup required to make useful analysis possible and advancing both Tableau dashboard development and longer-term ZI Chat data pipeline planning.

The convergence of production connector library, no-code function builder prototype, and advancing analytics infrastructure creates momentum for sophisticated automation capabilities, while external view requirements and data complexity challenges highlight the operational maturity needed to support enterprise-scale platform delivery.

## **Core Data Team Weekly Report - November 10-14, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The Core Data team made strong progress across multiple strategic initiatives this week, positioning us well for Q4 deliverables and 2026 planning. The waterfall integration achieved data-side readiness for December 1st delivery, while Heather Ma\'s Deal Insight Agent reached production-ready status with full cross-team alignment. The team also advanced Forrester Wave preparations, launched an accelerated GTM Store integration process, and established a new monthly release notes framework for improved customer communication. While we swarmed a Spamhaus blocking incident mid-week through rapid remediation with our ESP partner, the team maintained momentum on critical M8 infrastructure requirements and Board of Directors product development.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Heather Ma achieved breakthrough progress on the Deal Insight Agent production plan, completing internal reviews with the Agentic AI platform team and securing Brandon Wilson\'s commitment for Python development work. The admin portal release for CN data sharing is on track for November 18th launch, with FAQ documentation finalized and customer-facing team communications prepared through a new Slack channel. This positions CN as a critical differentiator for enterprise renewals while establishing scalable infrastructure for AI-powered insights.

The waterfall initiative under John Durst\'s leadership achieved critical data-side readiness, with confirmation of December 1st delivery to workbooks. The team successfully advanced source grouping display names and integration components while identifying opportunities to establish better processes for handling enterprise customer data questions. John noted that \"large customers are constantly reviewing our data even post deal,\" highlighting the need for systematic support processes.

Magnus Herweyer reviewed strategic direction on threat detection, establishing a build-first approach for Shared Services API while maintaining multi-vendor backup strategies with Webbula, EmailOverSight, and AtData. The NeverBounce team\'s discovery that 50% of emails are catch-all validates our opportunity for innovation, with sales explicitly requesting threat detection capabilities that \"Apollo and others don\'t offer.\"

**Goals & Progress**

**Contributory Network Infrastructure:** Successfully navigated Swapper.exe depreciation planning ahead of Microsoft\'s April 2026 Windows 11 transition. Heather coordinated with PLG teams to understand both business and technical contexts, establishing initial workstream ownership and migration strategies. The Deal Insight Agent architecture now includes fallback strategies and normalization dependencies, with all critical teams aligned for production deployment.

**Leadership & Board Data Product:** Advanced product requirements with multiple engineering partners, securing alignment for addressing strategic customers like Spectrum who are \"interested in deep executive intelligence which has a market opportunity for us to offer such artifacts.\" The team is positioned to increase AI credit consumption by building on the data foundation, with formal design review scheduled for November 20th.

**GTM Store Lightning Round Initiative (Peter Overman):** Launched accelerated integration process for 3 datasets to streamline our data onboarding pipeline. MSPs schema addition completed with 2 Autobound datasets progressing through source analysis. This initiative targets reducing dataset integration time from months to weeks, enhancing our competitive data coverage velocity.

**Company M8 Infrastructure:** Completed critical DIP and CERA requirements reviews with Jason Zhang and Rohit, marking both ready for implementation. Established framework for Monthly Company Release Notes process to provide regular transparency about data improvements, preparing for Monthly Cube releases starting January. The engineering team\'s hybrid approach proposal for Phase I demonstrates collaborative problem-solving around scope optimization.

**Strategic Opportunities**

The Spamhaus incident, while requiring immediate attention, revealed valuable insights about email validation that can drive product differentiation. Our discovery that spam traps can appear \"safe\" then trigger blocks days later when dormant domains activate positions us to build industry-leading threat detection capabilities that competitors lack.

The Forrester Wave evaluation provides a platform to showcase our data quality advantages, with the team preparing compelling demo flows that highlight our unique capabilities in data coverage, accuracy, and transparency.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Peter Overman\'s \"lightning round\" integration approach is already yielding insights about bottlenecks in source analysis and schema additions, providing a roadmap for streamlining dataset onboarding from months to weeks. This acceleration capability becomes a competitive advantage as we race to expand coverage.

Heather Ma\'s investigation revealed that normalization processes are owned by Shared Services rather than Data Science, clarifying ownership and enabling better cross-team coordination. Her success with the admin portal\'s Backstage tool implementation demonstrates how PM self-service capabilities can eliminate engineering dependencies for rapid iteration.

The CN pipeline reaching full operation - processing 1 million seeds daily and infusing 2.5 million LinkedIn profiles into PTI - establishes a sustainable enrichment cadence that directly improves contact information accuracy. Peter\'s processing of 45 million domains through the business parser, yielding 8 million company names with critical attributes, demonstrates our ability to extract value from massive unstructured datasets.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Heather\'s coordination across Agentic AI platform, GTM Data Management, and Admin teams for Deal Insight Agent demonstrates the complexity of CN initiatives requiring alignment across at least four different engineering groups. The calendar participant data flow into PTI required coordination between George, John, Kristen from PTI, and Roi\'s pipeline team - illustrating how even seemingly simple data ingestion requires extensive cross-functional orchestration.

The integration between Magnus\'s Shared Services and AI Data Management reveals mutual opportunity - AIDM needs Shared Services for normalization capabilities while Shared Services needs clear requirements from AIDM for Job Title Translation, Person Name validation, and Address Classification. Strategic partnership discussions with Transunion/Neustar highlight the importance of vendor relationships for maintaining phone validation capabilities critical to the business.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on capitalizing on our momentum while preparing for critical Q4 milestones and year-end deliverables.

The Forrester Wave demo preparation takes priority, with the team finalizing demo flows that showcase our data quality and coverage advantages. Jody will coordinate with solutions consultants to ensure compelling positioning for the analyst evaluation.

Heather will drive Deal Insight Agent launch preparation while finalizing Swapper depreciation strategy with clear workstream ownership and migration timelines before the April 2026 deadline. The admin portal\'s November 18th release requires comprehensive customer communication and support team enablement, while Calendar participant data integration needs final schema alignment between PTI and pipeline teams.

Magnus must finalize Shared Services delivery dates for AIDM integration and establish governance models for service consumption across teams. The email deliverability improvements require immediate implementation of threat detection capabilities, with POCs planned for top NeverBounce customers to validate demand and inform potential vendor acquisition decisions.

Cam and the company team will close M8 Phase I scope decisions while implementing the new Monthly Release Notes process to improve transparency about ongoing data improvements. Peter will advance the lightning round integration process to identify and eliminate bottlenecks preventing rapid dataset onboarding.

John\'s waterfall implementation faces critical onsite meetings where final workbooks approach will be determined, requiring clear source grouping documentation and codified mapping requirements. Rituparna will drive Board of Directors design review on November 20th while completing 5x5 international data evaluation for expansion opportunities.

The team\'s strong execution this week positions us well to deliver against ambitious Q4 goals while building foundation for 2026 strategic initiatives.

## **GTM Data Platform Team Weekly Report - November 10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

By obtaining cross-team alignment to maintain BigQuery alongside Solr through the GraphQL API to support the Dec 1st developer workshop, Marc Delurgio, Linda Johannessen, and Menna Rashwan preserved momentum with the apps teams and de-risked the December 31st deadline to have GQL ready for apps teams, while establishing a clear migration path to Solr as feature parity develops. The scope expansion adding Engagement data mid-stream to Solr created immediate delivery pressure, but the team\'s agile approach will meet commitments while building toward the Solr-based solution.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

The team obtained critical stakeholder alignment that clarified the backend architecture strategy for the GraphQL API. The decision to maintain BigQuery for first-party queries while using Solr for cross-entity searches and traditional search operations removes a major feasibility concern for the December 1st developer workshop. This architectural flexibility means app developers can begin GraphQL integration by December 1st using proven infrastructure while the team continues building out Solr-based capabilities in parallel.

Menna Rashwan revised the Enterprise Search milestone plan to incorporate Engagement data into the December 31st scope. While the team identified that content interactions will likely miss the deadline due to complexity, she established clear priorities with Linda\'s help: ensuring existing CRM data works through Federated Search takes precedence over new datasets, followed by engagement data for the core workbooks use cases. The team is actively evaluating technical paths and will scope down use cases based on feasibility assessments currently underway.

**Goals & Progress**

**Federated Search Integration:** The Search team developed a comprehensive plan for bringing Engagement data into Solr with UUID generation strategies and is evaluating approaches for deep object traversals and aggregations. Menna Rashwan\'s team is working through whether to implement real-time aggregations versus pre-aggregated data patterns. The decision to use a shim based on the current Solr typespec allows the team to meet delivery commitments, though this creates known future rework once new Company and Contact schemas are finalized. Linda Johannessen is coordinating closely with Menna\'s team on prioritizing workbooks use cases and ensuring the required data is ready.

**Location Matching:** Moshik Levin completed the first draft of the Regional HQ product brief and is preparing it for engineering review next week. The team discovered that the existing \"domestic HQ\" flag in company data doesn\'t reliably represent what customers need for regional main office identification, particularly around mergers and acquisitions. Moshik is scheduling a meeting with Marc Delurgio, Ethan, and Cam to evaluate whether to fix the existing field or introduce a new one, as adding yet another field could create customer confusion.

**Strategic Challenges**

The mid-stream addition of Engagement data to the December 31st scope created immediate planning pressure. While Menna Rashwan\'s team has identified the high-level work chunks, significant evaluation remains around data complexity and technical implementation paths. The team is working through use case prioritization with limited time to finalize decisions. Content interactions emerged as particularly challenging and will likely be deferred past December, requiring stakeholder communication about scope boundaries.

Schema alignment for Company and Contact data revealed more complexity than initially expected. The decision to proceed with a shim-based workaround using existing Solr fields enables the December 31st delivery but creates known technical debt. Once Linda Johannessen and the data producers finalize new schemas, there\'s risk of breaking changes that require fundamental rework in how Federated Search integrates with GraphQL. The team is scheduling data producer workshops to accelerate schema finalization and minimize future disruption.

Cross-team coordination remains intensive with dependencies spanning multiple engineering teams. The Enterprise Search work requires tight synchronization between Menna\'s team and Linda\'s team on use case definitions, schema specifications, and technical implementation details. Upcoming meetings including a PII review for engagement data and workbooks will help clarify priorities, though the compressed timeline leaves little room for discovering additional complexity.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The team learned that architectural flexibility provides more delivery certainty than attempting perfect solutions under time pressure. The multi-backend approach initially seemed like compromising on the long-term vision, but Philip\'s support for using BigQuery where it works well while building out Solr capabilities in parallel actually accelerates both near-term delivery and long-term migration. This pragmatic stance acknowledges current reality while maintaining strategic direction.

Linda Johannessen\'s noted that the performance bottleneck isn\'t BigQuery versus Solr for data access---it\'s the network transfer of millions of IDs between systems. A query joining first and third-party data took two to three seconds regardless of which platform hosted the data. This finding validates the Federated Search strategy of keeping third-party data in Solr to avoid expensive wire transfers, while allowing first-party queries to use whichever backend performs best for the specific use case.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Work with the Search team on Federated Search integration continues to be essential for enabling Workbooks to scale efficiently. Menna Rashwan\'s team is actively engaged on the Engagement data pipeline and UUID generation approach. The team is evaluating deep traversal patterns and aggregation strategies that will determine query performance characteristics. Linda Johannessen is working closely with Menna\'s team to ensure prioritized use cases and required datasets are ready for Workbooks to begin integration in January.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on finalizing Engagement data scope and completing schema alignment work. Menna Rashwan will participate in the engagement review with Randy and the workbooks team to understand detailed requirements and establish use case priorities. This clarity is essential for the team to determine what can realistically be delivered by December 31st and what needs to be scoped out or phased.

Moshik Levin will kick off engineering work on the Regional HQ proof of concept, with the product brief ready for team review. The meeting with Marc Delurgio, Ethan, and Cam will determine whether to improve the existing domestic HQ flag or introduce new fields, directly impacting the technical approach. Marc Delurgio continues managing the unified profile hiring pipeline with additional candidate interviews and case study presentations scheduled. Linda Johannessen will continue working with data producers on schema finalization and coordinating with Menna\'s team on Federated Search integration priorities to keep both Workspaces and Workbooks tracks moving forward.

## **Integrations Team Weekly Report - November 10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

ZoomInfo is positioned to be showcased at Google Next with Engine as the customer highlighting our Agentforce solution, validating our strategic direction in the agent ecosystem. Prateek Paikray is leading the Salesforce Agentforce partnership, which has flagged a \$500M Q4 pipeline and wants ZoomInfo integrated into their sales motions, though they\'re requesting free Copilot seats for their sellers---Prateek is coordinating with Adam Sayles and partnerships on commercial terms. The Field Mapping Agent now works end-to-end in staging and will be demoed at the Agent Think meeting this week, while backend improvements for import mapping redesign are enabling Rayee to start frontend work next week.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Prateek Paikray secured Engine as a showcase customer for Google Next, where they\'ll present the ZoomInfo Agentforce solution at a marketing event hosted by Google. This nomination validates that the team\'s work is creating measurable market impact and provides concrete proof points for the go-to-market strategy. The customer selection demonstrates strong partnership execution and positions ZoomInfo prominently in the agent ecosystem conversation.

The Field Mapping Agent achieved a significant technical milestone this week, with Andres Perez successfully updating the system to pull admin connectors from FMS and work end-to-end in staging. The agent now automatically uses the admin\'s CRM access token to check fields, eliminating a key integration hurdle. This advancement will be demonstrated at the weekly Agent Think demo meeting, showcasing tangible progress on the agentic platform.

Lareina delivered simplified import mapping designs with backend work completed for phase one, allowing Rayee to begin frontend development next week. The redesign introduces more restrictions and fewer mappable fields initially, streamlining what had become an overly complex user experience. The approach prioritizes delivering a working solution quickly while setting up phases two and three for live updates and additional capabilities.

**Goals & Progress**

**GTM AI Context Service & Vertical Datasets:** Prateek Paikray delivered UI enhancements for platform readiness on Vertical Datasets and completed alignment with engineering on multi-instance CRM support requirements. The engineering team is now preparing the high-level design before implementation begins. Mock-ups for integrating Vertical Datasets with workbook data for enrichment are in progress, with designs focused on job posting and other commonly requested customer use cases being developed with Peter\'s input.

**GTM Studio & Copilot V2:** Andres Perez completed new spec docs for Product and Opportunity Line Item work and reviewed them with MJ and David Wheeler. However, this initiative will be deprioritized since no consumers can access this data until GraphQL is live---audiences can\'t read it, GTM config hasn\'t figured out the web research path, and Copilot chat would reference offerings anyway. The team is instead prioritizing Fivetran work requiring one to two sprints from Teams 11 and 6 to unblock ServiceNow and other vendors while delivering custom objects in parallel.

**Salesforce Agentforce & MCP Integration:** The team held productive discussions with Salesforce on their upcoming MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, currently in beta. Prateek Paikray has been nominated along with Kuranthi and Adam to attend a partnership session on November 20, where Salesforce will enable only three participants per partner. The team learned that accessing MCP tools for external partners will require new scopes when creating apps via the Developer Portal, and that MCP tool responses may return text rather than JSON, requiring investigation into Lightning Web Component presentation strategies.

**Strategic Challenges**

The SalesOS customer interface gap continues creating friction, evidenced by escalations from Zoom Video and BBSI this week. Both customers discovered ZoomInfo had opportunity data when they saw the ROI dashboard, but since they\'re only on SalesOS, they questioned why ZoomInfo possesses this data without giving them adequate access. While engineering delivered a backend feature to block import of certain objects, the real solution requires giving these customers better interfaces to access GTM Data Model data---potentially through Audiences or Workspace without AI credit features. This blocks the Q3 goal of deprecating SalesOS and needs support from Victor, Philip, and Dominik to define a path forward that improves experience while paywalling expensive AI features.

Cloud Data Share regression testing uncovered a blocking issue where audience exports fail entirely if a ZoomInfo ID is missing. Prateek Paikray reached out to the workflows team to understand why this strict requirement exists, as it prevents customers from exporting valid audience data to Snowflake and Databricks when records lack ZoomInfo IDs. The bug needs resolution before implementation guides can be finalized, and the team is working to complete regression testing and prepare documentation once the issue is addressed.

Marketplace documentation has fallen significantly behind with the addition of new Data Connectors and OAuth partners. The public marketplace needs updating to reflect current capabilities, and this represents a long-overdue housekeeping item. Assuming no higher-priority work emerges, Andres Perez will dedicate time next week to overhauling the advertising of integrations both internally and externally, ensuring customers and internal teams have accurate information about available connectors and partners.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Salesforce\'s Agentforce push is creating unexpected partnership opportunities but also commercial complexities. Prateek Paikray is leading this partnership, where Salesforce is driving a \$500M Q4 pipeline and wants to position ZoomInfo\'s Agent for Sales use cases in their sales motions, but they\'re requesting free Copilot seats for their sellers to demo the solution. Prateek has been coordinating internally with Adam Sayles and the partnership team on next steps. Adam has connections with Salesforce\'s CS services arm who may be interested in purchasing seats, which represents a more sustainable model. The discussion surfaced a key strategic question: should ZoomInfo provide discounted seats to enable Salesforce\'s sales organization, or should the focus be on paid implementations with their services arm and actual customers?

The MCP integration architecture learned this week could fundamentally change how ZoomInfo delivers Copilot features in the future. After leading discussions with the Salesforce team, Prateek Paikray discovered that MCP tools consume bulk credits for data API access but restrict account intelligence features to upgraded tiers. This creates a natural monetization path where non-Copilot customers could access data APIs through MCP if they pay for bulk credits, but account intelligence capabilities remain paywalled behind Copilot, Workspace, or Studio. The team is exploring whether to swap existing capabilities for MCP-based tools once the integration is validated.

A significant opportunity emerged with FedEx, valued at \$1.3M, far exceeding the initial \$300-400K estimate. Ravi, the strategy director, reached out after receiving positive feedback on his pitch for the Agent for Sales solution. This opportunity prompted strategic thinking about product prerequisites: should customers be required to have Copilot to access Agentforce integrations, or could Studio serve as the platform fee? Studio makes more sense because it doesn\'t require paying elevated per-seat costs for thousands of users, includes one admin seat, and enables data management app and consumption capabilities. This could become the standard model for platform access without forcing expensive Copilot seat requirements.

The GTM Data Model record volume dashboard work revealed an opportunity to build the capability once rather than repeatedly for each vendor. Andres Perez created a bare-bones prototype covering the data model with Karina and team, showing that the same query filtered by vendor would work universally. Building it right once prevents technical debt from accumulating as more vendors get added, and ensures consistent reporting across all data connectors.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the User Management team remains essential for delivering multi-instance CRM support with role-based export controls. The team needs an API to fetch role information to demonstrate the proof-of-concept for egress using the existing platform feature. Prateek Paikray coordinated with engineering to leverage this existing capability rather than building net-new functionality, but implementation depends on User Management delivering the required API endpoint. A grooming session is scheduled for next week to finalize requirements once the API availability is confirmed.

The Fivetran work prioritization requires coordination with Teams 6 and 11 for one to two sprints to unblock ServiceNow and other vendor integrations. This work takes priority over Product and Opportunity Line Item work since those features have no consumers until GraphQL becomes available. The sequencing decision ensures engineering resources focus on removing vendor blockers while maintaining parallel progress on custom object delivery, but requires buy-in from both teams on the sprint commitments.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on three strategic priorities that position the team for accelerated delivery in subsequent weeks: Salesforce MCP enablement, Vertical Dataset design completion, and marketplace documentation overhaul.

Prateek Paikray will attend the November 20 Salesforce MCP partner session and work to enable the MCP add-on in the ZoomInfo Salesforce org, allowing hands-on exploration of how Agentforce integrates with MCP tools. Success means validating whether existing capabilities should be swapped for MCP-based tools and understanding the technical requirements for consuming account research and scoring tools that internal teams are registering. Simultaneously, he\'ll continue driving Vertical Dataset design work with audiences, coordinating with Peter and the team to mock up use cases beyond job postings that customers frequently request. He\'ll also follow up with engineering and QA teams to complete Cloud Data Share regression testing for Snowflake and Databricks, preparing implementation guides once the ZoomInfo ID requirement issue is resolved.

Andres Perez will focus on marketplace documentation, adding Data Connectors and new OAuth partners to the public marketplace to ensure customers and internal teams have accurate integration information. He\'ll also coordinate the Fivetran work prioritization with Teams 6 and 11, ensuring ServiceNow and other vendors get unblocked efficiently. The Field Mapping Agent demo at Agent Think will showcase the end-to-end staging environment to stakeholders, demonstrating tangible agentic platform progress.

The team enters next week with strong partnership momentum from Engine and Salesforce, clear technical achievements in the Field Mapping Agent, and strategic clarity on product positioning questions around Copilot versus Studio as platform access points. With the import mapping redesign enabling Rayee to start frontend work and MCP integration learnings being applied hands-on next week, the team is positioned to deliver meaningful customer value while navigating complex partnership commercial discussions.

## **Product Ops Team Weekly Report - November 10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team achieved a major breakthrough in automated release processes this week, successfully creating the first version of automated product information extraction from code that will fundamentally change how product releases work. Daniel Kong and Kristin Gandini proved out the automated changelog system can work in production, processing engineering\'s AI release tech output into deployment summaries that generated release notes with PM demo videos for the November 18 release. Ken Elwell successfully built the Voice of Customer pitch analysis system in GTM Studio, demonstrating a compelling use case that connects customer call analysis at scale with Workspace execution capabilities. The week\'s ELT session on Workspace and GTM Studio pitches revealed that while the semantic pipeline has the right components, filtering data to solve specific GTM Studio use cases remains challenging and requires focused attention.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

**Automated Release System Breakthrough:** Daniel Kong and Kristin Gandini successfully created the first automated product information output from code, proving the system can streamline the product release process. The team processed engineering\'s AI release tech from Dan DeSwaan and Shirhen\'s team, converting raw code changes into deployment summaries that fed into release notes generation with PM demo videos for the November 18 release. This POC demonstrates the feasibility of cutting PM time significantly and enabling weekly or bi-weekly releases that bring downstream teams along with product velocity.

**Voice of Customer Analysis at Scale:** Ken Elwell completed the Voice of Customer pitch analysis system in GTM Studio, establishing the process and tools for analyzing customer calls at scale. The system creates a compelling use case that connects to Workspace for execution, delivering capabilities no other company currently offers. This work positions the team to provide actionable insights from customer conversations with minimal manual effort.

**Workspace and Studio Learning Session:** Brett Jacobs led an ELT session reviewing the first few weeks of Workspace and Studio pitches, surfacing valuable learnings about the semantic pipeline\'s capabilities and limitations. The session confirmed that while the semantic pipeline contains the right components, the challenge lies in filtering data down to answer specific GTM Studio use cases---a finding that Ken and Sam\'s VOC work validated and that now requires focused problem-solving.

**Goals & Progress**

**Automated Release Pilot Expansion:** Kristin Gandini will circulate a proposal to expand the automated MCR process pilot for Workspace and Studio through end of year. The proposal requires buy-in from TPM and PM leads to make this the standard motion, with plans to scale to other products in Q1. The pivot from VOC agents to MCR automation addressed an immediate gap created by Workspace not using the standard release tracking process, demonstrating the team\'s ability to adapt to business needs while advancing automation capabilities.

**Planning Workshop Redesign:** Caleb Munson is building out a fundamentally different planning approach based on Dominik\'s feedback, shifting from traditional capacity planning to play-based planning. The new model will have teams build out plays over one to two days, estimating both build costs and AI consumption value, with expanded participation to team leads and managers. Caleb is working through the mechanics of play definition and estimation approaches, with stakeholder communication and deliverable finalization planned for next week.

**MCP Platform Technical Resolution:** Sam Darcy encountered friction with the agentic MCP team, who flagged that MCP\'s external-facing platform isn\'t ideal for internal tools. After discussion with Carter Van Huss, Sam and the MCP team agreed that whitelisting the agentic platform within ZI Chat would provide the cleanest solution. Sam reached out to William and Jack to restart that approval process, with plans to remove the MCP component entirely once whitelisting is secured.

**Strategic Challenges**

**Voice of Customer Data Filtering:** Brett Jacobs identified a significant challenge in filtering the semantic pipeline data to identify which calls actually had pitches completed. The issue is substantial enough that Dominik raised it to Rowan and the GTM Studio team. While Ken and Brett achieved good results in their analysis, the underlying difficulty of getting the right data set filtered properly represents a blocker that needs resolution to make VOC analysis consistently reliable and scalable.

**Release Tech Data Completeness:** Daniel Kong is waiting on the most recent dataset from Dan DeSwaan\'s team to ensure the automated release system is capturing all relevant code changes. Some product updates may have been missed based on date and keyword capture logic, requiring closer collaboration with engineering productivity to validate comprehensive coverage before scaling the automation approach beyond Workspace and Studio.

**Planning Model Knowledge Gaps:** Caleb Munson faces uncertainty about the relationship between AI credits, Plays, and Play Components---knowledge needed to design effective estimation models. He\'s meeting with Derek Osgood next week to discuss AI consumption calculations and is working to find the middle ground between estimation that\'s useful and estimation that creates excessive administrative burden. The expanded scope to team leads and managers adds complexity to workshop design and facilitation.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Automated Release Tech Is Comprehensive:** Kristin Gandini\'s work with Dan DeSwaan and Shirhen\'s team revealed that the AI release tech from engineering productivity is more comprehensive than initially understood. The team is making some assumptions about what was missed based on date and keyword capture, but the foundational data quality suggests strong potential for expanding to more products if the capture methodology can be refined and validated.

**GTM Studio\'s Unique Competitive Position:** Ken Elwell\'s discovery that analyzing customer call data at scale in GTM Studio, combined with Workspace for execution, represents something no other company currently offers. This insight positions the team to develop a differentiated capability that connects customer intelligence gathering directly to action, though realizing this potential depends on solving the data filtering challenges identified this week.

**External vs Internal Tool Architecture:** Sam Darcy learned that the agentic MCP server is designed for external users, not a sustainable solution for internal tools. This architectural mismatch surfaced through the PR review process and led to identifying a better approach through ZI Chat whitelisting. The learning highlights the importance of understanding platform design intent when selecting technical infrastructure for team tools.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The collaboration with Dan DeSwaan and Shirhen\'s engineering productivity team is advancing well, with clear mutual interest in making the automated release tech work. Daniel Kong needs closer coordination to ensure comprehensive data capture and validate nothing significant is being missed in the current extraction logic.

The GTM Studio team\'s involvement in resolving Voice of Customer data filtering issues is now escalated through Dominik to Rowan, indicating executive awareness of the challenge. Sam Darcy\'s path forward depends on Jack and William\'s approval for whitelisting the agentic platform in ZI Chat, removing the MCP dependency that\'s creating friction with Carter Van Huss\'s team.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on scaling proven systems while resolving data infrastructure challenges that enable broader deployment.

**Voice of Customer Data Resolution:** Brett Jacobs and Ken Elwell need to nail the VOC dataset filtering issue to make customer call analysis reliable and repeatable. This work connects directly to demonstrating GTM Studio\'s unique competitive advantage and requires resolution of the technical challenges in identifying relevant calls from the semantic pipeline.

**Automated Release Motion Standup:** Daniel Kong and Kristin Gandini will pilot the first automated release summary for Workspace, proving out the end-to-end workflow before proposing expansion. Kristin will circulate the proposal to extend MCR automation through end of year, requiring TPM and PM lead buy-in to make this the standard approach. Success here depends on validating data completeness with Dan DeSwaan\'s team and confirming the system captures all relevant product changes.

**Planning Workshop Launch Preparation:** Caleb Munson will finalize workshop deliverables and templates, draft the AI consumption model after meeting with Derek Osgood, and begin stakeholder communication about the new play-based planning approach. He\'ll also work on defining support for non-play work curation and drafting an engineering estimation model that balances utility with administrative efficiency. The expanded scope to team leads requires careful design to ensure the workshop delivers value at scale.

## **ZIM Team Weekly Report - November 10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Big win: Zoominfo was named an ABM(Account based marketing) leader for the second year in a row by Gartner! We\'re facing a critical inflection point: ZIM achieved 92% net retention in October, but 47% ACV churn---our highest in a year---with \$4M in December renewals at risk (60% unknown status). This is the result of engineering reallocation to GTM Studio and the Agentic platform. Filip has escalated to Sneh and Dominik, and we\'ve scheduled a bug bash for Sprint 25.25 (first week of December) to address customer-facing issues before these renewals close. Meanwhile, our infrastructure work continues to progress with Matt Barnes\' website identity pipeline back on track and MCR launching Tuesday.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Matt Barnes recovered critical momentum on the website identity pipeline after earlier setbacks. The team developed a plan to get all required website data delivered by January, with website data expected by end of sprint and form-complete PubSub available early-mid next week. This unblocks the webhook delivery work that Dominik has been tracking and enables website buyer ID to flow into GTM audiences.

Jesse Miller successfully onboarded the Yoda team to the audience agent with orchestrators now live in the demo environment, allowing the team to test context injection and subagent routing. He pivoted the Applied AI planning approach from premature ticket creation to focused knowledge transfer sessions, preventing wasted effort and ensuring Q4 execution stays on track.

Shuxin Yang achieved alignment on the intent agent approach for co-pilot requirements and finalized the strategy for getting account-level intent into GTM Store. Despite this not being the ideal long-term solution, it provides a pragmatic path forward. Resources are now secured to start Persona Intent this sprint, with Yoda picking up quick wins next sprint.

**Goals & Progress**

**Agent Platform & Migrations:** Brett Elliot is wrestling with the web search agent Temporal migration(Agent Infra), discovering timeout issues when processing 10K row workbooks. The team is exploring smarter job chunking strategies, with a fix expected tonight. The good news is that the emailer agent migration started in parallel and appears to be a simpler lift. Both migrations remain on staging until these issues are resolved.

**Website Identity & Infrastructure:** Matt Barnes completed 75% of the webhook delivery PRD with an end-to-end walkthrough scheduled Monday with Mesh. The websites API blocker for flywheel data partners is resolved with a manual provisioning approach (Eli Greenstein assisting). Tuesday launch: AI PageRank and automated bot filtering via MCR.

**LinkedIn Campaign Management & Agents:** Jesse Miller delivered requirements to Sylvia for LinkedIn campaign management UI mocks (V1 expected next week), which will be 90% reusable for Meta versions. Troy is leading agent architecture with Applied AI eager to contribute once knowledge transfer is complete, targeting demoable MVP agents for sales and CX showcase.

**GTM Config & Person Briefs:** Aadhitthyaa completed schema design for offerings data changelogs and made 50% progress on AFS onboarding flow. A Spectra customer call revealed a significant gap: Boardroom Insider\'s person briefs substantially outperform ours. Aadhi is adding podcast mentions, personal interests, and moving beyond the single XVRM vendor dependency to the roadmap.

**Intent & Persona:** Shuxin Yang secured alignment on creating one intent agent and finalized the approach for account-level intent in GTM Store. He\'s investigating volume and cost implications with Caleb (GTM Store can handle billions of signals). A visit with Staples uncovered that their engagement data could identify high-potential opportunities---a potential new intent source for enterprise customers that Shuxin will explore with Sanyog.

**Strategic Challenges**

The 47% ACV churn is a direct consequence of deprioritizing ZIM to staff GTM Studio and the Agentic platform. With \$4M in December renewals (60% status unknown), we need the bug bash in Sprint 25.25 to address customer-facing issues. This resource allocation tradeoff was necessary for strategic priorities, but we must demonstrate value to at-risk customers immediately. Filip is aware and has escalated appropriately.

Brett\'s web search agent timeout issues highlight the complexity of migrating production workloads to Temporal at scale. None of the 10K row jobs completed in stress testing. While the team is exploring solutions, this blocks production deployment and could impact customer-facing agent performance. We need to ensure the chunking strategy actually solves the problem before committing to this architecture.

Aadhi\'s gap analysis exposed a competitive vulnerability in person briefs. Boardroom Insider provides C-level executive and board information that\'s significantly more comprehensive than our current XVRM-only approach. With customers like Spectra explicitly requesting this consolidation, we\'re leaving revenue on the table. Rethinking our person briefs strategy needs to move from \"nice to have\" to \"competitive necessity.\"

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The target accounts concept needs a strategic decision: should we evolve the existing feature or deprecate it in favor of account priority score? This conversation has been ongoing, but it\'s blocking Aadhi\'s ability to proceed with the onboarding flow work. We need alignment on the long-term vision to avoid building on a foundation we\'ll abandon.

We should build an agent within the ZI chatbot to evaluate identity partner data. As we continue testing with partners like Cuspera (who are requesting more credits), we need systematic analysis of: new users being identified, verification of existing visitors, and quantification of the delta. This would help us make data-driven decisions about partner value rather than intuition-based credit allocation. Sindhu is tasked with initial Cuspera analysis.

Shuxin\'s Staples visit revealed that enterprise customers have rich engagement data they don\'t know how to prioritize. Helping them identify which engagements deserve follow-up to maximize revenue potential could become a differentiated intent capability. This generalizes beyond Staples---many enterprise customers likely have similar untapped data that we could turn into actionable intelligence.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Adobe is nearing completion on their integration testing for ZI as a destination. We\'re waiting for approval to launch to DX & DME teams so their internal teams can use it ASAP, with IBM Red Hat also planning Q1 usage. Once this closes, we need a 2025 retro to improve the 2026 process for the next integration where ZoomInfo serves as a source of data---the current approach has been challenging and we should learn from it.

Matt\'s website identity pipeline work depends on Sneh and Victor\'s team, who won\'t be ready until January. This timeline is set and communicated to Dominik. The pipeline feeds multiple consumers (GTM audiences, App and others), so delays ripple across teams. We\'ve built the plan around this constraint, but any further slippage from their side would cascade to our Q1 deliverables.

**Looking Ahead**

Our immediate focus is protecting the December renewals while maintaining momentum on infrastructure and agent platform development. The MCR launch Tuesday (AI PageRank and bot filtering) demonstrates continued delivery despite resource constraints.

Next week, Jesse\'s team gets V1 LinkedIn campaign management UI mocks for review, Applied AI deep dives continue for knowledge transfer, and we push toward demoable MVP agents for sales and CX to showcase on renewal calls. Matt\'s webhook delivery PRD and end-to-end walkthrough Monday should unblock that workstream. Brett needs to resolve the web search agent timeout issues and get both migrations to production. Aadhdi prioritizes Yoda quick wins with Tomer on Monday and continues weekly GTM Config reviews with Dominik to develop the long-term roadmap people keep requesting. Shuxin investigates intent volume/cost implications with Caleb and explores the Staples engagement data opportunity with Sanyog.

The bug bash in Sprint 25.25 is our best opportunity to shore up customer confidence before year-end renewals close. We\'re being transparent about the impact of resource reallocation while demonstrating we\'re still shipping value and addressing technical debt that affects customer experience.

## **Product BI Team Weekly Report - November 10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team delivered the first Voice of Customer report analyzing two weeks of sales conversations, providing an objective data foundation that sales leadership can reference when prioritizing product decisions and objection handling. Brett and the team provided comprehensive data on chat reliability issues and user adoption patterns that are informing critical Workspace improvement priorities.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Brett Jacobs and the Product BI team successfully delivered the first Voice of Customer report that analyzed two weeks of sales conversations. This report provides sales leadership with an objective data foundation they can reference when making product prioritization decisions and developing objection handling strategies. The analysis surfaced concrete patterns in customer conversations that are now informing product roadmap discussions.

The team provided comprehensive analytics on Workspace chat reliability issues and user adoption patterns. The data revealed that 60-70% of users always or often double-check data in Salesforce, and response times are rated slower than acceptable by the majority of users. These metrics are directly informing Victor\'s prioritization of critical Workspace improvements needed to demonstrate 10x value over Copilot V1.

Brett led an ELT session reviewing the first few weeks of Workspace and Studio pitches, surfacing valuable learnings about the semantic pipeline\'s capabilities and limitations. The session confirmed that while the semantic pipeline contains the right components, the challenge lies in filtering data down to answer specific GTM Studio use cases---a finding that requires focused attention from the engineering teams.

**Goals & Progress**

The Voice of Customer analysis system is now operational and producing actionable insights at scale. The team established processes for analyzing customer calls systematically, connecting the analysis to both Studio for data management and Workspace for execution capabilities. This represents a differentiated capability that no other company currently offers in the market.

Analytics infrastructure for tracking AI Action Credit consumption is established and operational. The first report went out tracking early consumption patterns across nine accounts, all currently on the Studio side. This baseline reporting will evolve as workspace adoption scales and more cohorts come online, providing critical visibility into credit consumption patterns.

**Strategic Challenges**

The Voice of Customer data filtering challenge represents a significant technical blocker. Brett identified that filtering the semantic pipeline data to identify which calls actually had pitches completed is substantial enough that Dominik raised it to Rowan and the GTM Studio team. While Ken and Brett achieved good results in their analysis, the underlying difficulty of getting the right data set filtered properly needs resolution to make VOC analysis consistently reliable and scalable.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The objective data from customer conversations is proving more valuable than anecdotal feedback for prioritization decisions. Sales leadership can now reference concrete patterns and metrics when discussing product gaps and objection handling, rather than relying on individual seller experiences. This shift toward data-driven product prioritization is helping align the organization around the most impactful improvements.

The Workspace reliability metrics surfaced through BI analytics provided the quantitative foundation needed to prioritize chat accuracy and performance improvements. Without these metrics, the team would be relying on subjective assessments of user satisfaction rather than concrete data about double-checking behavior and response time expectations.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The team\'s work depends heavily on the semantic pipeline team to resolve data filtering issues. The ability to identify relevant customer calls systematically is fundamental to scaling the Voice of Customer analysis beyond manual curation. Resolution of this dependency will unlock the full potential of the VOC analysis system.

Coordination with the GTM Studio team on semantic data quality continues, as the BI team needs reliable access to conversation intelligence data to power their analytics. Rowan\'s involvement in resolving the filtering challenges indicates the strategic importance of this dependency.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week the team will focus on refining the Voice of Customer analysis methodology to address the data filtering challenges identified this week. Brett and Ken will work with Rowan\'s team to develop more reliable approaches for identifying relevant customer conversations from the semantic pipeline.

The team will continue expanding AI Action Credit consumption reporting as more customers come online with Workspace. Additional cohorts entering the system will provide richer data for understanding consumption patterns and identifying opportunities for optimization.

Analytics support for the November 18 release will be critical, as the team provides data-driven insights to inform go-to-market messaging and help sales teams understand early adoption patterns. The BI team\'s role in connecting product metrics to revenue outcomes continues to grow in importance as Studio and Workspace scale.

## **Provisioning & Login Team Weekly Report - November 10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The Admin Defined Territories feature pushed final UI tweaks to production staging, targeting Monday/Tuesday feature flag opening for the main November release. The team completed Info Packs documentation and additional upload templates while working through MCP integration to open territories into the agentic layer. David also advanced Priority Accounts work with initial UX designs for CRM rules socialized across the Context team, though progress was slowed by urgent customer escalations requiring developer attention.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

David Wheeler\'s Admin Defined Territories feature reached production readiness this week, with final UI tweaks pushed to production staging. The feature is targeting Monday/Tuesday feature flag opening for the main November release, representing a major milestone in the Admin Zero Experience initiative. The team successfully completed all Info Packs documentation and additional upload templates to support customer onboarding.

The team made progress on MCP integration work to open territories into the agentic layer, though this faced some delays due to urgent Workbooks tasks and KTLO (keep the lights on) issues. The integration work is expected to resume next week once the higher-priority customer escalations are resolved.

Priority Accounts work advanced with David making meaningful progress prototyping CRM matching rules using the new GraphQL interface from GTM Data Model. Initial UX designs for CRM rules were socialized across the Context team, though the team discovered that Robyn and Ardi are pursuing a different approach using AI to work through CRM data, creating a need to align on how both approaches work together.

**Goals & Progress**

**Admin Zero Experience:** The Admin Defined Territories feature is now in staging and ready for production deployment early next week. This capability allows administrators to define territories for their sales teams directly within the ZoomInfo admin portal, eliminating the need for complex manual configuration processes. The feature includes comprehensive documentation through Info Packs and multiple upload templates to support different customer territory definition patterns.

**Priority Accounts Development:** David prototyped CRM matching rules using the GraphQL interface, demonstrating how the new GTM Data Model can power flexible priority account definitions. However, coordination is needed with the Context team (Robyn, Ardi) who are pursuing an AI-based approach for working through CRM data. The team needs to align on how both approaches work together to serve customers with and without clean CRM data.

**MCP Integration:** Work continues on opening territories into the agentic layer through MCP integration, enabling agents to understand and respect territory assignments when making recommendations or taking actions. This work hit temporary delays but remains a priority for completing the Admin Zero Experience vision.

**Strategic Challenges**

Urgent customer escalations required developer attention this week, slowing progress on Priority Accounts and MCP integration work. The team had to shift resources to address KTLO issues and critical Workbooks tasks, demonstrating the ongoing challenge of balancing new feature development with maintaining existing functionality and resolving customer issues.

The discovery that the Context team is pursuing a different technical approach for Priority Accounts (AI-based versus CRM matching rules) creates a coordination challenge. The team needs strategic alignment on whether to support both approaches, merge them into a unified solution, or select one path forward. This decision affects not just the Priority Accounts feature but the broader strategy for how ZoomInfo handles customers with varying levels of CRM data quality.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The Admin Defined Territories implementation revealed that supporting multiple upload templates and territory definition patterns is essential for enterprise adoption. Different customers organize their territories in fundamentally different ways---some by geography, others by account lists, others by industry vertical---and the product needs to accommodate these variations rather than forcing a single opinionated model.

The GraphQL interface from GTM Data Model proved effective for powering CRM matching rules in the Priority Accounts prototype. This validates the technical architecture direction and demonstrates that the new data model can support flexible, customer-specific business logic without requiring custom engineering for each use case.

The divergence between CRM-based matching rules and AI-based data interpretation approaches for Priority Accounts highlights a fundamental product question: should ZoomInfo provide deterministic rule-based systems, AI-powered intelligent interpretation, or both? The answer likely depends on customer sophistication and data quality, but the product strategy needs to explicitly address this choice rather than letting different teams build competing solutions.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Coordination with the Context team (Robyn, Ardi) is essential for aligning on the Priority Accounts technical approach. The team needs to understand how CRM matching rules and AI-based data interpretation can work together, or determine if one approach should take precedence. This dependency affects not just feature delivery timelines but the fundamental product architecture for account prioritization.

The MCP integration work depends on the broader agentic platform infrastructure being ready to consume territory definitions. While the Provisioning & Login team can prepare the territory data and API endpoints, the full integration requires the MCP team\'s gateway infrastructure and the orchestration layer to properly route agent actions based on territory assignments.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s immediate priority is the Monday/Tuesday feature flag opening for Admin Defined Territories in the November release. David will coordinate final smoke testing and work with the go-to-market teams to ensure customer-facing documentation and support teams are prepared for the launch.

The team will resume MCP integration work for territories once the production deployment stabilizes and urgent KTLO issues are resolved. This work is critical for completing the Admin Zero Experience vision where territory definitions automatically flow into the agentic layer.

Priority Accounts alignment meetings with the Context team need to happen next week to resolve the technical approach question. David will schedule working sessions with Robyn and Ardi to understand their AI-based approach and determine how to integrate it with the CRM matching rules prototype. The goal is to establish a unified product direction that serves customers across the data quality spectrum.

Absolutely! Let me add the PMM Engine Team report to the appendix:

## **Product Marketing (PMM Engine) Team Weekly Report - November 10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team delivered the first Voice of Customer report this week, which generated productive discussion at the ELT level and confirmed that the platform narrative is resonating well in the field. Jennifer Scharrer, Akshath Dorai, and AJ Belen are making progress on addressing field confusion around Studio and Workspace positioning while building foundational AI messaging assets. The objection handling agent reached V1 status and is 80% ready for deployment, requiring only minor refinements before rollout.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Brett Jacobs completed and delivered the first Voice of Customer report, which was reviewed by the ELT on Thursday with strong engagement from leadership including Dominik, Victor, Sneh, and Tuna. The report validated that the platform narrative is resonating across sales teams, with multiple sales leaders independently confirming this feedback. This represents a significant milestone in establishing data-driven GTM decision-making.

Akshath Dorai built the first version of the objection handling agent in just one week, achieving 80% completion on outputs that can address real-time field questions. The agent successfully processed the VOC report and generated relevant responses, demonstrating the potential for self-serve enablement at scale. While distribution mechanisms and quality controls remain to be built, the core engine is functional and ready for iteration.

Jennifer Scharrer separated AI positioning work into two distinct frameworks after productive sessions with Jesse Lindstrom from Product. The first addresses how ZoomInfo messages the AI and intelligence engine powering the platform, while the second focuses specifically on how AI action credits are positioned as a pricing model. This clarity will prevent the conflation of product value with cost discussions that has created confusion in early customer conversations.

**Goals & Progress**

**GTM Studio & GTM Workspace**: The VOC report revealed field confusion about when to use Studio versus Workspace, prompting discussion about integrated demos that cover both products upfront. AJ Belen and the leadership team are considering a revised demo approach where sellers present both products initially, then lean into one based on customer use cases and maturity. Jennifer Scharrer is developing 2-4 slide GIF solutions to help sellers explain the Studio-to-Workspace flow without requiring SC resources for every early-stage conversation. These visual assets will require design team support and are estimated at a 3-week timeline if storyboards can be finalized this week.

**Objection Handling Process**: Akshath Dorai completed V1 of the objection handling agent and ran initial tests using VOC report inputs. The agent requires 30-60 minutes of weekly refinement to reach production quality, with next steps including integration of curated Q&A assets from enablement and establishing a spreadsheet-based answer repository. AJ Belen reviewed the output and provided feedback, noting that several improvements can be made now without waiting for seller input. The team plans to have a curated one-pager of top objections ready by mid-next week, replacing the existing HTML objection handling page that enablement currently maintains.

**Voice of Customer Loop**: Brett Jacobs established weekly ELT reviews of the VOC report starting this Thursday, with Tuna joining as a standing participant despite not being on the ELT. The report structure and review cadence will enable rapid iteration on field feedback. Dominik is pushing for weekly changelog or release notes covering PMM updates, objection handling additions, and other field-facing changes to maintain transparency on continuous improvement efforts.

**Strategic Challenges**

The team identified overlapping but separate positioning needs for AI capabilities that were causing confusion in both internal discussions and customer conversations. Jennifer Scharrer and Jesse worked through this during their session, realizing they needed distinct messaging frameworks: one for the intelligence engine\'s value proposition and another for the action credit pricing model. With Jesse out all of next week, Jennifer will leverage Adam Smith as a resource to continue progress, though the timing gap may slow iteration cycles on these foundational assets.

Field teams are experiencing confusion about Copilot versus Workspace positioning, particularly in renewal and growth scenarios where customers already use Copilot with Account AI without credit charges. While the directive to prioritize Workspace for new business has been given, the tactical guidance on whether to mention Copilot at all remains unclear. Additionally, the current guidance to default to standard Copilot for prospects without Salesforce or interest in CRM integrations may need revision, as expanded CRM support is on the product roadmap though timing is not yet confirmed. This creates risk of leaving Workspace revenue on the table with Dynamics and HubSpot customers.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The VOC report revealed that sellers need visual aids to explain cross-product workflows more than they need demo environments. The request from the field isn\'t for SC support on every call but rather for quick, accessible assets that let them say \"let me show you something real quick\" the way they can with other products they have direct access to. This insight is driving the GIF solution approach, which will be more scalable than building demo environments or requiring SC involvement in early conversations. The challenge is that Studio access restrictions prevent sellers from doing quick product tours, making polished visual assets necessary for early-stage positioning.

The objection handling agent work demonstrated that building the engine first and distribution mechanisms second is the right sequencing. Akshath Dorai\'s approach of focusing on output quality before tackling Slack notifications, public access, and feedback loops aligns with the team\'s capacity constraints. The agent\'s ability to reference a curated spreadsheet of validated Q&A pairs will prevent drift in messaging while still allowing the AI to address novel questions, creating a hybrid model of human oversight and automated scale.

Separating AI intelligence positioning from AI credit pricing messaging emerged as an unexpected but valuable insight from Jennifer Scharrer and Jesse\'s brainstorming session. The two topics kept blurring together during discussion, creating confusion about when to introduce cost considerations versus when to establish value. This separation will enable clearer customer conversations, with intelligence capabilities discussed upfront to generate interest before introducing the pricing model in a way that demonstrates customer benefit rather than vendor monetization.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The team\'s work with the design team on GIF assets requires clear storyboarding this week to hit a 3-week delivery timeline, making collaboration with visual design resources a pacing factor for the Studio-Workspace positioning solution. Victor\'s team is exploring Workspace as an enablement competitor (high spots, Seismic, Lessonly), and Jennifer Scharrer will spend 1-2 hours with them next week providing her perspective on where this makes sense versus where it doesn\'t. This represents an interesting convergence of GTM needs and product direction that could influence how the team thinks about Workspace positioning long-term.

Enablement maintains an existing HTML objection handling page that will need to be deprecated once Akshath Dorai\'s agent is production-ready. Jennifer Scharrer proactively managed this by telling enablement to hold off on extensive revisions to the current page, promising a replacement in 1-2 weeks. This coordination will be important for avoiding confusion about which resource is the source of truth, and the team will need to ensure a clean handoff with enablement when the new agent launches.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s priorities center on refining the objection handling agent to production quality, completing AI positioning and credit messaging frameworks, and finalizing storyboards for the Studio-Workspace GIF assets. With Jesse out all week, the team will rely more heavily on Adam Smith for AI messaging input.

Akshath Dorai will iterate on the objection handling agent Tuesday through mid-week, incorporating feedback from AJ Belen and Jennifer Scharrer to reach a state where curated one-pagers can be distributed to the field. The focus will be on integrating the existing enablement Q&A content into the agent\'s reference spreadsheet and ensuring output quality is high enough for self-serve use. Jennifer Scharrer will complete first drafts of both AI messaging frameworks and continue work on the launch process proposal, while also supporting Victor\'s team on the Workspace-as-enablement exploration. AJ Belen will drive alignment with enablement and sales on the AI action credit plan, ensuring downstream teams understand the positioning and can execute effectively.

Sean Walters\' upcoming paternity leave means Ant will serve as the Workspace DRI in the interim, which Akshath Dorai is already coordinating with through a meeting scheduled this week. The team should monitor whether this transition creates any gaps in product partnership or roadmap clarity, particularly around CRM integration timing which remains uncertain for Q1.
