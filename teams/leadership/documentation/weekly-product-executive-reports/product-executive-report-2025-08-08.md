## **Executive Summary**

### **Update on Previous Week Blockers**

**September GTM Studio launch timeline integrity threatened by convergent technical dependencies:** Critical escalation as Product DAI team reports \"Engineering platform dependencies (query layer) have been pushed to 2026, forcing all dependent products to either find workarounds or delay until next year. This directly impacts our H2 growth plan which relies on three key revenue drivers: Copilot, Studio, and Vertical Datasets.\" However, GTM Studio team maintains \"GTM Plays M1 PRD is 70% complete and scheduled for critical stakeholder review Thursday,\" indicating mixed progress across workstreams.

**AI pricing and packaging fundamental disconnects threatening monetization strategy:** Partial resolution achieved with Admin team reporting \"a key strategic decision was made to centralize the price book for AI credits to support enterprise readiness and scalability. However, the ownership of this centralized system is still an open question.\" The fundamental pricing architecture is advancing but operational ownership remains unresolved.

### **Current Week Update**

**Blockers:**

- **Platform query layer delay creating cascade failure across multiple product launches:** Product DAI team escalates that platform query layer delays to 2026 force \"all dependent products (GTM Studio features, CRM enhancements, custom fields, signals) to find workarounds or delay launches,\" while multiple teams report dependencies requiring immediate executive clarity on platform strategy and acceptable technical debt levels.

**Momentum areas:**

- **Enterprise data capabilities reaching production scale with measurable business impact:** Core Data team achieved \"significant breakthrough on contact quality with production testing of indistinguishable contacts detection, potentially impacting millions of duplicate records,\" while Integrations team \"successfully onboarded Email data into GTM Data Model for ZI-on-ZI (targeting 90%+ tenant populated by end of next week),\" and ZIM team delivered \"major technical milestones achieved with LiveIntent integration deployment.\"

- **Revenue generation initiatives showing concrete pipeline validation:** Data team reports \"\$10M+ in vertical dataset revenue with strong execution momentum\" through \"named account mapping, with sufficient high-value customers already identified who can consume data in bulk,\" while Product DAI team achieved \"Partnership API Momentum\" with \"immediate interest from previously hesitant vendors\" including Clary reversing earlier rejection.

**Bottom line:** Technical infrastructure is reaching enterprise scale with major data quality and integration breakthroughs, while revenue opportunities show concrete validation through named account mapping and partner interest, but platform architecture delays to 2026 require immediate executive intervention to determine acceptable workaround strategies versus timeline adjustments for H2 growth commitments.

### **Mission-Critical GTM Jobs (Customer-facing GTM intelligence capabilities)**

**GTM Studio Team:** \"GTM Plays M1 PRD is 70% complete and scheduled for critical stakeholder review Thursday, positioning us to enter build stage if approved. However, dependency mapping reveals significant cross-team coordination needs that could impact M1 timeline. Meanwhile, Jagannath\'s AI Agent capabilities achieved breakthrough progress with multi-column enrichment and custom signals integration, and Arun\'s FAQ Agent for ROI dashboard addresses the overwhelming complexity of 20+ metrics.\"

**Product DAI Team:** \"Critical Decision Needed: Studio GA timeline is at high risk for September launch. Engineering platform dependencies (query layer) have been pushed to 2026, forcing all dependent products to either find workarounds or delay until next year. This directly impacts our H2 growth plan which relies on three key revenue drivers: Copilot, Studio, and Vertical Datasets. Immediate executive intervention required to clarify platform strategy and resource allocation between workarounds vs. delays.\"

**SalesOS/Copilot Team:** \"Bottom Line: We\'re strategically shifting from incremental feature releases to comprehensive \'wow moments\' that will define Copilot v2\'s market position, with Victor leading an Aha moment tiger team to ensure our September launch creates genuine competitive differentiation rather than another feature update.\"

### **Data Foundation & Consumption (Platform capabilities enabling GTM intelligence)**

# **📊 Appendix**

### **Individual Team Reports**

# **DAI Executive Roundup - \[August 4th - August 8th, 2025\]**

## **Executive Summary**

Critical Decision Needed: Studio GA timeline is at high risk for September launch. Engineering platform dependencies (query layer) have been pushed to 2026, forcing all dependent products to either find workarounds or delay until next year. This directly impacts our H2 growth plan which relies on three key revenue drivers: Copilot, Studio, and Vertical Datasets. Immediate executive intervention required to clarify platform strategy and resource allocation between workarounds vs. delays.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Vertical Dataset Revenue Validation: Brandon Tucker\'s team validated the \$10M incremental upsell opportunity for vertical data cubes, completing best-fit account mapping for Restaurant (53 accounts), Contractor (48 accounts), and Franchise (339 accounts). The team is now scheduling direct conversations with Account Managers to assess account health and budget availability for H2 deals.

Partnership API Momentum: Andres Perez successfully launched API access for partners, with immediate interest from previously hesitant vendors. Clary reversed their earlier rejection citing FOMO, Insightly CRM wants to build integrations, and Medicine Logic plus multiple others are in the pipeline. However, legal agreements are creating bottlenecks in the onboarding process.

Magic Quadrant Strategic Positioning: Victor Oliveros is leading preparation for Gartner\'s Revenue Action Orchestration Magic Quadrant (deadline August 19th), with 25% of scoring dependent on forecasting capabilities. The team identified a potential solution using Rowan Bailey\'s graph neural network forecasting model currently in R&D testing.

### **Goals & Progress**

Copilot Pro Demo Readiness: Adam Smith\'s team made significant weekend progress on demo stability, moving confidence from 50% to 70% for a non-embarrassing demo state. However, major quality and consistency issues remain, with content accuracy problems and slow iteration cycles hampering QA processes. The team is simultaneously trying to prepare for demos while addressing technical debt from rushed development decisions.

GTM Studio September Release: Sneh Kakileti\'s team (via Brahm Kohli) reports good progress on core components including CRM unblocking, workbooks, and job postings. Critical areas needing clarity include agentic audiences and activation pathways to Outreach/Salesloft. The team is hearing strong validation from early access customers, particularly around engagement data and agentic experiences.

Product Marketing Engine Evolution: AJ Belen\'s team is transitioning from reactive to proactive approaches, developing roadmaps through October for content creation and context feeding. The challenge intensifies with Lauren\'s upcoming maternity leave, requiring immediate resource reallocation and process automation to maintain velocity.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Platform Query Layer Delay Crisis: Dominik Facher announced that the engineering platform\'s query layer will not be available in 2025, forcing all dependent products (GTM Studio features, CRM enhancements, custom fields, signals) to find workarounds or delay launches. This creates a cascade of impacts across the product portfolio and threatens H2 revenue commitments.

Copilot Quality vs. Speed Tension: Adam Smith\'s analysis reveals Copilot currently loses in direct comparisons to existing I-Chat functionality, and even standalone users wouldn\'t adopt it daily due to content quality issues. The team faces the dilemma of maintaining demo momentum while building foundational robustness for GA readiness.

Go-to-Market Readiness Gaps: Multiple teams report enablement and messaging challenges. Sales teams lack clarity on GTM Studio positioning, PMM processes are still being defined with Darrell Grissen\'s departure, and there\'s insufficient sales engineering support for complex customer scenarios.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Agentic Development Scaling Limitations: Adam Smith discovered that horizontal scaling with 20 engineers can\'t solve domain expertise bottlenecks in AI agent development. Quality improvements require deep sales methodology knowledge that only specific team members possess, creating a natural constraint on development velocity that raw engineering resources can\'t overcome.

Customer Data Integration Complexity: Andres Perez\'s team learned that IP address alone is insufficient for visitor resolution; success requires storing multiple cookies and session data in GTM Data Model. This insight changes the technical architecture requirements for Site Visitor Resolution services and customer data attribution.

Vertical Dataset Market Depth Over Breadth: Brandon Tucker\'s analysis shows greater revenue potential from developing deep subject matter expertise in fewer datasets rather than rapidly launching many shallow offerings. The contractor dataset alone has hundreds of potential data sources, suggesting focused specialization will outperform broad coverage approaches.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Engineering Platform on query layer capabilities has become the critical bottleneck for multiple product launches. Imesh\'s team made clear that platform query capabilities won\'t be available until 2026, requiring all product teams to develop alternative technical approaches. This affects GTM Studio\'s core functionality, CRM integrations, custom fields support, and signals processing. Teams are exploring workarounds including direct BigQuery access (with known tech debt), Snowflake data sharing, and federated search approaches.

Partnership integration workflows depend on Legal, Security, and Procurement process streamlining. Current 6+ week timelines from intent to signed agreement are overwhelming smaller partners and burning relationships before signature. The team needs executive support to differentiate data acquisition contracts from infrastructure/security procurement processes.

### **Looking Ahead**

This week exposed the fundamental tension between our aggressive H2 growth commitments and platform readiness realities. The query layer delay forces a strategic choice: accept technical debt through workarounds to maintain timeline commitments, or delay product launches to build proper foundations.

Next week\'s priorities center on damage assessment and mitigation strategies. Brandon Tucker will conduct account health assessments for vertical dataset opportunities to validate Q4 revenue potential. Adam Smith will balance copilot demo preparation with architectural cleanup to prevent further technical debt accumulation. The GTM Studio team must lock in September scope based on available technical capabilities rather than ideal product vision. Most critically, Dominik Facher needs to establish clear expectations with the growth plan stakeholders about platform constraints and timeline adjustments, enabling honest resource allocation decisions rather than hoping engineering can overcome fundamental architectural gaps through effort alone.

The path forward requires executive clarity on acceptable risk levels: are we willing to launch products with workaround architectures to hit growth numbers, or do we delay revenues to build sustainable technical foundations? This decision will determine resource allocation, go-to-market strategies, and stakeholder expectations for the remainder of 2025.

# **GTM Studio Roundup - 08/04/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

**GTM Plays M1 PRD is 70% complete and scheduled for critical stakeholder review Thursday**, positioning us to enter build stage if approved. However, **dependency mapping reveals significant cross-team coordination needs** that could impact M1 timeline. Meanwhile, Jagannath\'s AI Agent capabilities achieved breakthrough progress with multi-column enrichment and custom signals integration, and Arun\'s FAQ Agent for ROI dashboard addresses the overwhelming complexity of 20+ metrics. Critical path items need immediate attention: Hubspot integration clarity for ROI GA and DeltaX contract negotiations to prevent vendor lock-in risks.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**AI Agent Platform Integration delivered major capabilities expansion** with Jagannath\'s team completing multi-column enrichment including Data Agent, CRM integration, and custom signals (intent spikes, tech aggregates, scoops). The conversational experience now supports workbook creation from ZoomInfo, CRM, and CSV sources, with architecture decisions finalized for temporary playground functionality versus technical workbook requirements.

**GTM Plays requirements crystallization accelerated significantly** as Veronica\'s team achieved 70% completion on the M1 PRD, with focused positioning around play definition and visual understanding. Dependencies are significant, requiring comprehensive mapping to ensure M1 delivery success.

**ROI Dashboard user experience enhancement progressed with innovative FAQ Agent implementation** as Arun\'s team addressed the overwhelming nature of 20+ metrics through embedded AI assistance. This self-service approach reduces support dependency while empowering customer understanding of complex analytics, critical for GA readiness.

### **Goals & Progress**

**AI & Analytics Initiatives**: Arun advanced both the FAQ Agent embedding within ROI analytics (in staging testing) and shifted correlation logic from account owner-based to interaction-based attribution for improved customer comprehension. Jagannath achieved 60% completion on GTM Agent with successful multi-column enrichment capabilities and custom signals integration, though newsletter communication shifted to next week due to prioritization demands.

**GTM Plays & Activation**: Veronica reached 70% completion on Plays M1 PRD with stakeholder review scheduled for Thursday, while Corina completed 100% of plays analytics validation research and partner data dependency coordination. Mohan progressed 90% on DeltaX migration with successful vendor negotiation for custom endpoint solutions, though workbook activation requirements continue refinement across multiple integration points (Copilot Pro, Ringlead/Outreach/Salesloft, GTM plays orchestration).

**Data & Workbooks**: Tanvi achieved 60% progress on September GA scope with signal-based workbooks successfully handed off to engineering and add-to-sheet functionality documentation completed. Ash advanced AI Data Management prototyping through stakeholder design reviews and validated core pain points with internal users, establishing foundation for cross-functional alignment.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Hubspot integration uncertainty threatens ROI GA timeline and affects approximately half our customer base** who have connected CRM with opportunity data sharing. Root cause analysis reveals integration platform data quality issues requiring immediate decision: proceed with GTM Data Management temporary solution or punt post-GA. This impacts significant revenue potential given Hubspot\'s prevalence in our customer base and renewal implications.

**Cross-team dependency complexity for GTM Plays M1 is significant**. Requirements gathering has uncovered extensive coordination needs with workflows team, individual action/trigger owners, and platform teams. While not blocking current progress, the dependency matrix suggests implementation complexity that requires proactive management to prevent M1 timeline risks and resource bottlenecks.

**Vendor relationship management presents strategic business continuity risks** as DeltaX demonstrated with production incident caused by unrestricted access to demand gen account. Though migration solutions progressed well, long-term strategy must address either locked-in longer contracts (3+ years) or direct LinkedIn API access development to eliminate vendor dependency vulnerabilities and price manipulation risks.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Technical architecture decisions around AI user experience revealed the magic versus control paradox** as teams across Data Management, Workbooks, and Plays consistently discovered that customers demand transparency and intervention capabilities over autonomous AI actions. This pattern emerged from Data Management stakeholder feedback emphasizing control over configuration changes, workbook agent feedback requiring human-in-the-loop functionality, and plays orchestration needing user oversight of automation decisions.

**Workflow system limitations surfaced as fundamental constraint for activation capabilities** when Mohan\'s team discovered that current workbook export V1 workflows cannot support essential sales engagement features like add-to-sequence, add-to-campaign, or cadence management out-of-the-box. This technical gap requires additional orchestration capability development and impacts all downstream activation pathways including Outreach, Salesloft, and other sales tools integration.

**Customer onboarding experience gaps became apparent through early access program feedback** as technical complexity around workbook creation, signal understanding, and feature adoption created barriers despite strong underlying capabilities. This drove team prioritization toward conversational interfaces and simplified user journeys, with Jagannath\'s agent work directly addressing the need for natural language interaction over technical configuration requirements.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with **Carlos and the Platform team on GTM Config context and facets** continues to be critical for both plays functionality and Copilot integration. Progress made this week with base use case alignment around product offering context definition, though engineering sizing and directional timelines still pending. **Workflows team coordination** remains essential for both plays trigger/action implementation and workbook activation capabilities, with Marc Frail\'s continued collaboration required for comprehensive trigger library development.

**Integration Platform team partnership with Erica and Prateek** requires immediate attention for Hubspot ROI resolution, while **Analytics team alignment** progresses smoothly for usage definition format and business question prioritization across multiple workstreams.

## **Looking Ahead**

**Primary focus centers on Thursday\'s GTM Plays M1 PRD review** which represents our critical gate to build stage entry and H2 execution momentum. Success requires comprehensive dependency documentation, stakeholder alignment, and clear risk mitigation strategies for identified cross-team coordination challenges.

**Technical implementation acceleration** will proceed across multiple parallel workstreams: FAQ Agent production deployment, signal-based workbooks engineering completion, DeltaX migration execution, and AI agent architecture refinement for natural user experience. The interconnected nature of these initiatives demands careful coordination to prevent resource conflicts while maintaining delivery quality and timeline commitments.

**Strategic decision points require executive attention on vendor relationship management, Hubspot integration path determination, and cross-functional resource allocation** to ensure business continuity while advancing innovation objectives. Successfully navigating these decisions will position the team for strong H2 execution and customer value delivery.

# **SalesOS/Copilot Executive Roundup - \[August 4th - August 7th, 2025\]**

## **Executive Summary**

Bottom Line: We\'re strategically shifting from incremental feature releases to comprehensive \"wow moments\" that will define Copilot v2\'s market position, with Victor leading an Aha moment tiger team to ensure our September launch creates genuine competitive differentiation rather than another feature update.

The team is making solid progress across multiple fronts - Adam has completed onboarding flow alignment with Whitney for Copilot v2, Gabe is launching internal beta testing for MEDDPICC extraction with Rev Ops, and David is 90% complete on Admin Defined Territories with only testing remaining. However, we\'re confronting a critical strategic decision: whether to ship incremental improvements in phases or invest 3-5 months in building the right solution from day one, recognizing that historically we never return to upgrade version 1.5 products to version 3.0.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Copilot v2 Onboarding Breakthrough: Adam completed the final onboarding flow walkthrough with Whitney, successfully integrating his Aha moment framework with Ryan\'s evolving Copilot v2 design in Figma. This represents a major milestone in ensuring users experience immediate value through pre-identified book size, personas, and target account recommendations rather than facing empty-state setup friction.

MEDDPICC Agent Beta Launch: Gabe organized internal beta groups with Rev Ops and resolved access issues to begin hands-on validation of automated MEDDPICC extraction outputs before building any UI. The team is positioned to start internal testing next week with named beta reps and trigger configurations, representing a significant step toward validating extraction logic before UI investment.

Admin Defined Territories Near Completion: David achieved 90% completion on End User Explainability for Admin Defined Territories, overcoming backward compatibility issues from Ringlead\'s code refactoring. Despite engineering delays, the core functionality should complete testing by week\'s end, clearing a major blocker for GA readiness.

### **Goals & Progress**

Advanced Search Evolution: Al made substantial progress on UXR preparations with refined prototypes and questionnaires, though he\'s waiting for final customer usage data to complete invitee selection. The research framework is positioned to validate whether Advanced Search deserves its name in the LLM era, with interviews potentially starting during his PTO next week under Sarah\'s leadership.

Intent Topic Intelligence: Harinath completed 100% of auto-assignment framework development and finished 80% of LRT processes for August releases including Intent Recommendation and AFS Download functionality. The auto-assignment logic will reduce friction by eliminating manual topic research while maximizing use of allocated Intent Topic slots, though final verification with Al Nevarez remains pending.

Company Profile Transformation: Ant progressed on both dynamic company profile PRDs and extension overhaul documentation, completing initial stakeholder review with strong validation of the agentic profile direction. However, discussions with Victor revealed the strategic tension between shipping incremental Phase 1 improvements versus investing in comprehensive Phase 3 \"zapier-style\" agentic capabilities from the start.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Engineering Competency Gaps for GTM Data Model Migration: David\'s team faces knowledge transfer challenges as they migrate from current target/priority accounts to the GTM data model needed for sophisticated CRM matching that upmarket customers demand. The core issue isn\'t engineering skill but rather the learning curve required to understand new platform capabilities, with key stakeholders Harsha and Imesh unavailable last week to provide critical guidance.

Data Science Coordination Complexity: Adam discovered significant overlap between his Day 1 intelligence initiative and the data science team\'s suggested company population work, creating both opportunity and dependency risk. While there\'s potential gold in leveraging their existing COI (companies of interest) capabilities for tenants without CRM setup, the timeline uncertainty around AFS 2 makes this collaboration a calculated risk rather than a core dependency.

Product Philosophy Tension on Incremental vs. Transformational Releases: The team is grappling with whether to ship Phase 1 improvements to company profiles and other features knowing they\'re \"subpar\" but provide immediate value, versus investing 3-5 months in Phase 3 capabilities that would create genuine market differentiation. This decision impacts multiple workstreams and reflects broader questions about balancing short-term delivery pressure with long-term competitive positioning.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Aha Moments Require Market-Relative Thinking: Victor\'s analysis revealed two types of aha moments - those relative to our existing SalesOS platform and those relative to market alternatives. The critical insight is that we must focus on market-relative aha moments to drive actual user adoption and retention, not just internal feature comparisons that may seem impressive but don\'t differentiate against competitors.

Standard vs. Custom Intent Topic Volume Imbalance: Al discovered that the intent topic volume boost disproportionately benefits custom topics while leaving growth opportunity on standard topics, which are more widely used and about to expand further with topic recommendation features. This finding suggests the need for amended throughput logic that significantly increases standard topic volume while preventing future decay, requiring collaboration with COIN and Venkata.

Revenue Operations Integration Complexity: Gabe\'s work revealed that our custom intent request process lacks logical connection with sold packages in Salesforce, potentially allowing customers to receive custom topic benefits without appropriate entitlements. This discovery, combined with the absence of maximum custom topic entitlement limits, suggests systematic entitlement operations issues requiring review with Carlos Chevalier.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Data Science team on Day 1 intelligence presents both opportunity and risk for Adam\'s onboarding initiatives. Their existing COI capabilities and suggested company algorithms could dramatically accelerate user value creation for accounts without CRM setup, but timeline uncertainty around AFS 2 makes this collaboration supplementary rather than foundational to our core onboarding strategy.

The Search team dependency for David\'s GTM Data Model migration remains critical but temporarily blocked by key personnel availability. Resolution requires coordination with Harsha and Imesh to translate platform capabilities into actionable migration plans, with potential overlap requiring Victor\'s involvement to align with Rowan\'s context team work.

### **Looking Ahead**

Focus shifts to defining and implementing market-differentiating aha moments for Copilot v2 launch, with Victor leading a cross-functional tiger team to ensure our September release creates genuine competitive advantage rather than incremental feature updates.

Next week\'s priorities center on three critical decisions that will shape our product trajectory. First, we\'ll finalize the strategic approach to company profiles - whether to pursue comprehensive agentic capabilities from the start or accept incremental improvements knowing we historically don\'t revisit version 1.5 products. Second, Adam will complete the Data Science alignment assessment to determine how much existing day-one intelligence we can leverage without creating dependencies on uncertain AFS 2 timelines. Third, we\'ll begin internal beta validation of MEDDPICC extraction with Rev Ops while Gabe advances emailer agent capabilities for executive demo readiness.

The team is well-positioned to make these strategic decisions with strong execution momentum across all workstreams. Our challenge is maintaining the discipline to choose transformational impact over incremental progress, recognizing that market-leading aha moments require patience and investment but create sustainable competitive advantages that incremental feature releases cannot match.

# **Data Executive Roundup - \[August 4th - August 7th, 2025\]**

## **Executive Summary**

We\'re positioned to deliver \$10M+ in vertical dataset revenue with strong execution momentum, but need immediate focus on go-to-market enablement over new dataset development. The team validated feasibility of the \$10M goal through named account mapping, with sufficient high-value customers already identified who can consume data in bulk. However, go-to-market operationalization and sales team enablement represent bigger execution risks than data processing capabilities at this stage.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Brandon Tucker and Dow Jones achieved 70-75% completion on vertical dataset tactical planning, confirming the \$10M revenue target is realistic through account-to-dataset mapping analysis. The focus has appropriately shifted from pure dataset creation to actionable revenue generation with named accounts identified for each vertical.

Steve Hutchinson completed 100% of his contact recommender integration planning, establishing a clear path to increase person-level signals by 24% for Copilot users. The Data Science team confirmed viability of integrating Contact Recommender with User Level POI, creating a scalable foundation for more relevant signal generation.

Dana Hurtig delivered 80% completion on Latin America data expansion, successfully processing 200K contact bio updates using AI, deduping 250K mobile phones, and removing 100K junk VP+ contacts. The 1.1M Rhetorik company infusion is progressing through DIP platform with 1.4M associated contacts queued for follow-up processing.

### **Goals & Progress**

Data Quality & Infrastructure: Rob Priore achieved 100% completion of the ZI Lite ingestion audit, confirming blocking workflows function correctly while identifying a legal risk around stored but unused data that requires deletion. CN logic errors from April have been resolved, and cookie loading issues have been escalated to Google engineering for resolution.

Signal Enhancement: Brandon Wilson reached 60% completion on New Rep signal development, incorporating valuable feedback on the Won Deal Similar Account signal that significantly improved data usage and generation approach. The semantic data integration continues to show promise for enhancing signal relevance and reducing latency.

Agent Development: Jody Roberts made 50% progress on agent prototypes despite platform adoption challenges, focusing on org chart visualization within the agentic framework. The team identified significant opportunities for analysis agents to address ongoing data discoverability and documentation blockers.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Go-to-market enablement represents our highest execution risk for vertical datasets. While data processing capabilities are solid, operationalizing sales team support, creating compelling customer-facing materials, and building subject matter expertise across diverse verticals requires significant investment. The team needs dedicated focus on enablement and customer success rather than continued dataset expansion.

Data discoverability and documentation continue to constrain analysis productivity across the organization. Multiple team members cited this as a blocker during the AI hackathon, indicating broader organizational impact. The promising agent prototypes for analysis assistance need acceleration and broader deployment to address this systemic issue.

Legal and compliance workflows require ongoing attention with increasing customer scrutiny. Microsoft flagging Swapper.exe as malware has created customer concerns about data sharing, while California/Oregon opt-out processes need workflow updates to balance compliance with fraud prevention.

### **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The vertical dataset opportunity extends far beyond initial projections when coupled with proper account targeting. Analysis revealed sufficient high-value customers already in the pipeline who can consume data in bulk, with strong inbound interest across multiple verticals. The constraint is execution capacity, not market demand.

Customer behavior is shifting toward AI-driven data discovery, creating competitive pressure on our platform experience. When customers can\'t find company information in ZoomInfo, they\'re defaulting to ChatGPT for basic research. We need research agents that provide comprehensive company/contact profiles on-demand to maintain user engagement and platform stickiness.

Subject matter expertise development is becoming more critical than pure process automation for vertical datasets. Unlike core data where scalable processes work well, vertical datasets require deep understanding of industry nuances, regulatory environments, and state-by-state variations that can\'t be easily automated.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Data Science team on Contact Recommender integration is proceeding smoothly with clear technical alignment on User Level POI architecture. The 24% signal lift potential creates compelling value for Copilot v2 development timelines.

Platform team collaboration on agentic framework development needs acceleration to address analysis workflow bottlenecks. The authentication and integration challenges are limiting our ability to deploy promising agent prototypes that could significantly improve team productivity.

### **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s primary focus shifts from dataset development to revenue execution, emphasizing go-to-market readiness and sales enablement for existing vertical offerings.

The team will prioritize named account conversations with account managers, building customer-facing materials that clearly articulate vertical dataset value, and developing the subject matter expertise needed to support complex deals. Dana\'s work on contractor and franchise data syncing will continue, while Steve advances User Level POI development with Data Science team integration. Rob will focus on resolving cookie loading issues with Google engineering and advancing the ZI Lite data deletion process.

Most importantly, we\'re implementing a research data agent to address the competitive threat from ChatGPT-style interactions, ensuring ZoomInfo remains the first destination for company and contact research rather than losing users to external AI tools.

# **Admin Team Executive Roundup - 8/4/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

This week, a key strategic decision was made to centralize the price book for AI credits to support enterprise readiness and scalability. However, the ownership of this centralized system is still an open question. Since the prices are feature dependent and optimizing reduces ZI and Customer Cost, ownership should be with the team with expertise to optimize the costs. There is a meeting scheduled for next week to resolve this. Additionally, new requirements have emerged regarding the segmentation of AI credits and their impact on revenue reporting, which requires further discussion with key stakeholders.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Jessie Kain Lindstrom made progress on the high-leverage goal of finalizing the decision on the AI credit price book. The team achieved alignment on a centralized model for scalability and enterprise readiness, moving the goal to 50% completion. This decision is significant because it aligns with industry standards for enterprise-grade companies.

Brannen Huske continued work on closing out superseding contracts and revenue reporting, with progress made on the next stage of AI credits. A key discovery was the need to segment AI credits into \"usage-based\" and \"non-usage-based\" categories, which will be a focus for next week\'s discussions.

Josh Simon has begun working toward a product review of limiting the \"login as\" feature, which is an impactful change for the business. He is working on his goal of gathering more information to limit access and meet customer trust and up-market goals. This week, he shadowed various CX organizations to understand how they use the \"login as\" feature.

### **Goals & Progress**

**AI Credit Price Book**: Jessie Kain Lindstrom has reached 50% completion on the goal to finalize the decision on where the AI credit price book should live. The decision was made to centralize it for enterprise readiness, but the team ownership piece is still an open question to be addressed next week.

**Revenue Reporting & Contracts**: Brannen Huske\'s goal to close out superseding contracts and correctly report revenue to SAP is progressing. A major complication arose this week with the discovery that AI credits need to be segmented into usage-based and non-usage-based categories, which will require further discussion with dependent teams..

**Login as Feature**: Josh Simon has completed initial discovery by shadowing various CX organizations to see how they use the feature. Next week, he will continue shadowing different groups to gain a better perspective on what is needed to restrict access.

### **Strategic Challenges**

A significant challenge is the ownership of the centralized AI credit price book. While the team has decided to centralize it, a clear owner has not been assigned, and this is a blocker that requires a conversation next week to resolve. Jessie Kain Lindstrom notes that while a centralized approach is good for scalability and auditability, it could prevent other teams from moving quickly. A decentralized approach, conversely, would allow teams to move more quickly but might create issues with scalability and auditability.

Brannen Huske has identified a complication related to AI credits and revenue reporting for SAP. The team discovered a need to segment credits into usage-based (additional credits purchased) and non-usage-based (included in the base bundle). Additionally, for multi-year deals, the credits need to be accessible at specific cadences to prevent customers from spending all their credits upfront and then churning or going into collections. This complexity requires discussions with Mark Harris, Garrett Cummins, and the GTM Tech team to determine necessary guardrails and reporting methods.

Another challenge is an ongoing issue with Snowflake users being logged out or \"bounced\" from the platform sporadically. Josh Simon is working with the Dev team and has additional calls scheduled with the customer next week to understand the problem better. This blind spot is a priority for the login team.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Jessie Kain Lindstrom discovered that there are two schools of thought in the AI industry regarding architectural design: a \"move fast\" decentralized approach and a \"scalable, enterprise readiness\" centralized approach. The team decided to adopt the centralized model, which is the industry standard for enterprise-grade companies. This decision, while not irreversible, will have long-term repercussions on either the speed of development or the scalability and auditability of the system.

Brannen Huske\'s team learned that superseding contracts and revenue reporting for usage-based pricing require careful handling to avoid incorrect reporting of realized revenue to SAP, which could negatively affect how the company capitalizes. A key finding was the necessity to segment AI credits based on whether they are included in a base bundle or purchased additionally, as this affects how revenue is reported. The team also learned that multi-year deals require the optionality to mature AI credits at specific cadences to mitigate financial risk.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

**Mark Harris, Garrett Cummins, and the GTM Tech team** on revenue reporting is critical for ensuring our usage-based pricing model is correctly handled. Discussions are needed to determine the guardrails, reporting methods, and impact on skew creation and quote flow. The team also needs to get alignment on how Copilot v.2 will be enabled to create the correct packaging, if needed.

## **Looking Ahead**

The primary focus for next week is to resolve the open questions and challenges identified this week.

Jessie Kain Lindstrom will be meeting with different engineering and product teams to get a resolution on who will own the centralized AI credit price book. This decision is crucial for moving forward with the engineering scoping. Brannen Huske will continue to talk with Mark Harris, Garrett Cummins, and the GTM Tech team about the guardrails and reporting methods needed for the new segmentation of AI credits. This is a critical step to ensure that revenue is reported correctly to SAP and to finalize the tickets for a September completion. Josh Simon will continue to shadow more groups to gain a better perspective on what is needed to start restricting access to the \"login as\" feature and will have additional calls with the customer to solve the Snowflake login issue.

The artifact paradigm particularly accelerates visualization development, suggesting high potential for executive-facing tools and customer demonstrations.

**Resource Allocation Decision Points**: Magnus Herweyer\'s experience reveals that shared services advancement depends more on organizational priority clarity than technical complexity. Engineering teams need explicit executive direction about balancing existing roadmaps against new shared services requests to avoid coordination paralysis.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with PTI and company teams on gap analysis requires sustained coordination to unblock address normalization development. Magnus Herweyer\'s difficulty obtaining timelines and feedback suggests the need for executive intervention to establish clear accountability mechanisms and prioritization frameworks across teams.

Our work with the WDA team on \"high confidence\" location data represents a critical dependency for Q4 initiatives, with Cam Fortin leading requirements coordination that may accelerate delivery if properly resourced. The scheduled Google meeting indicates strong momentum toward resolving technical specifications.

The data science team coordination around international titles classification and indistinguishable contacts shows positive momentum but requires continued support for Anna\'s model development learning curve to maintain delivery timelines.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on converting technical breakthroughs into scalable solutions while resolving the organizational coordination challenges that threaten Q3 delivery momentum.

Cam Fortin will advance the industry model project back on track while continuing M8 profiler planning through field dictionary development and finalizing location data ingestion requirements with the WDA team.

John Durst will complete review of indistinguishable contacts results and advance CRM enrichment accuracy testing with Peter Overman, potentially unlocking millions of new contact matches. Jody Roberts will continue agent prototype development with focus on the Dominik-requested org chart visualization while establishing reusable frameworks for future executive demonstrations. Magnus Herweyer will escalate shared services prioritization questions to Brandon and Hasmik while pursuing gap analysis completion from PTI and company teams. Rituparna Das will execute the approved international titles classification timeline while providing additional support to Anna\'s model development process. Hayden Cowell will advance Polaris metrics implementation using the refined methodology for subjective accuracy and match-based coverage analysis.

The convergence of contact quality breakthroughs and agent platform capabilities creates opportunity for powerful customer-facing demonstrations, while shared services architecture planning positions the team for enterprise data quality leadership once organizational prioritization clarity is achieved.
