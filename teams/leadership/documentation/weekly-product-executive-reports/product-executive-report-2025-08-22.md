# **📊 Appendix**

### **Individual Team Reports**

# **DAI Executive Roundup - August 18th - August 21st, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Copilot V2 narrative control is now our highest priority - GTM teams are asking urgent questions about pricing, rollout strategy, and positioning after internal demos spread beyond the intended audience. Victor Oliveros has aligned rollout strategy with leadership and will demo to sales leaders Monday, but we need immediate executive coordination to prevent mixed messaging that could undermine Q3/Q4 renewals. Gartner Revenue Action Orchestration Magic Quadrant demo performed well Tuesday, positioning us as potential leaders quadrant candidates.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Victor Oliveros delivered a strong Gartner MQ demo performance Tuesday, demonstrating ZoomInfo\'s expanded platform capabilities beyond prospecting data. The team expects placement in either the challengers or leaders quadrant, with particular strength in top-of-funnel and sales coaching capabilities through Chorus integration. This positions us well for changing external market perception.

Dominik Facher reports October data release momentum is building with Company 3.0 infrastructure coming together. Multiple long-running initiatives are converging, including rebuilt data pipelines and enhanced company data quality. The team has also established promising flywheel partnerships, with OneMind moving quickly toward two new data streams in the next few weeks.

Sneh Kakileti\'s GTM Studio early access program now has 10 customers actively using the product, with expectations to reach 25-30 customers by mid-September. Customer feedback validates core features including engagement data and agentic experiences, with particular strength in new business account planning and prioritization use cases for Q4.

### **Goals & Progress**

Copilot V2 Rollout Strategy: Victor Oliveros achieved 95% completion on GTM rollout and PMM asset strategy, establishing clear cohort criteria and positioning framework. Sales leadership demo scheduled for Monday will jumpstart controlled rollout to high-value renewal customers starting late September/October. AJ Belen is coordinating enablement conversations to ensure proper activity ownership and prevent scope creep.

Technical Infrastructure: Ali Sadat made limited progress on Copilot V2 engineering alignment due to competing priorities, maintaining the same goal for next week. Critical discussions continue with Majid and Nebo on query architecture and CRM writebacks. Brandon Tucker achieved 80% progress on Company 3.0 strategy memo, with clear resource allocation for shared services and location data improvements.

Early Access Execution: Sneh Kakileti reached 20% goal completion on GTM Studio demo paths and roadmap clarity. Two critical infrastructure gaps emerged: need for centralized orchestrator for agentic tools/datasets, and inconsistent first-party data flows across product touchpoints causing customer confusion during export processes.

## **Strategic Challenges**

Cross-functional coordination gaps are consuming disproportionate time relative to technical complexity, particularly around contributory network data ingestion and partnership processes. Brandon Tucker reports 6-week procurement cycles that overwhelm smaller partners with security and legal requirements inappropriate for data partnerships. The team is working directly with procurement to streamline processes, with vendor relationships as the initial test case for an accelerated model.

Engineering resource clarity remains incomplete despite all-hands communication efforts. Team members report uncertainty about H2 priorities and connections between individual work and broader objectives. While strategic direction exists, the operating cadence and DRI assignments need refinement to ensure consistent execution understanding across all teams.

Customer performance and scale concerns are escalating as GTM Studio usage increases. Sneh Kakileti reports growing customer questions about service timing, workbook processing duration, and error handling. These issues weren\'t critical during early testing but require Q4 attention as the customer base expands to 25-30 active users.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Data platform architecture is becoming more modular and service-oriented, enabling faster integration of new datasets and attributes. Dominik Facher notes this shift from tightly integrated systems to platform/consumer models will accelerate custom dataset delivery and vertical use case support. The shared services framework, once properly resourced, will benefit multiple teams including Studio\'s data management needs.

Identity graph capabilities have reached market-leading status, creating partnership opportunities beyond direct competition. The Pipedrive discussions illustrate how ZoomInfo can serve market segments we wouldn\'t directly pursue while building contributory network effects. These PLG/enrichment partnerships could unlock significant data value with minimal customer acquisition costs.

Customer onboarding patterns reveal GTM Studio\'s learning curve validation from early access users like Brex. The platform requires simplified enablement approaches rather than intensive training programs. This insight is driving product decisions toward more intuitive workflows and better contextual guidance within the application.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with integrations and connectors teams continues to be critical for GTM Studio early access program support. Export functionality and CRM connectivity issues directly impact customer experience during the critical onboarding phase. Current dependencies on Platform team resolution of Hubspot opportunity data health issues are blocking ROI analytics progress for affected customers.

Enablement team coordination requires immediate attention as they\'ve developed broad rollout plans that don\'t align with our focused cohort strategy for both Copilot V2 and GTM Studio. AJ Belen reports 35-slide presentations and all-hands approaches that contradict our product-led motion strategy. Executive alignment needed on messaging ownership and activity boundaries.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on controlling the Copilot V2 narrative through precise sales leader engagement and enablement alignment. Victor Oliveros will conduct the Monday demo while AJ Belen drives conversations with enablement leadership to establish proper boundaries and expectations.

GTM Studio momentum continues building toward September soft launch with Sneh Kakileti driving alignment with sales and customer success leadership on Q4 support motions. Performance and scale improvements become critical as customer base approaches 30 active users. The team will prioritize error handling and processing transparency to maintain positive early access experience.

Engineering priorities and resource allocation require final clarity to maintain H2 execution momentum. While strategic direction is solid, operational details and individual contributor understanding need reinforcement to prevent execution drift. The upcoming engineering alignment sessions will establish clear DRI assignments and milestone dependencies.

# **SalesOS/Copilot Executive Roundup - August 18th - August 21st, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Intent Topic AI Recommendation feature successfully launched to 100% of eligible customers with immediate recommendations available for \~3,000 accounts. Harinath Krishnamoorthy delivered the full rollout with comprehensive monitoring systems in place. While where we end up in the Gartner MQ is unknown, Gabe Pirela\'s Gartner Magic Quadrant demo performance positioned us strongly for potential \"Leaders\" quadrant placement, with forecasting/pipeline management capabilities as the biggest questionmark. Key challenge: AI emailer prototype quality still needs significant improvement before engineering handoff, requiring human-level output standards to drive user adoption.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Intent recommendations went live across our entire customer base without critical incidents, representing a major step toward AI-driven user guidance. Harinath delivered not just the feature launch but established measurement frameworks through Amplitude events and Snowflake pipelines, enabling weekly adoption tracking. The 30-60% relevancy rate provides a baseline for iterative improvements while giving 3,000 customers immediate value.

Adam Severance completed Copilot internal access program setup, clearing the path for September\'s external customer beta. The AccountAI upgrade wave processed \~800 customers successfully, demonstrating our ability to execute large-scale product improvements. These operational wins build confidence for the upcoming GTM Copilot launch targeting \$61M in renewals through year-end.

Ant Cuomo\'s company profiles redesign work with Katya is uncovering significant opportunities to improve information presentation in GTM Copilot. Their daily 90-minute design sessions are yielding fresh approaches to profile architecture, particularly around intent integration. The mobile mapping feature discovery - despite being shelved due to location data quality issues - highlighted both our data gaps and the substantial market opportunity in field sales route optimization.

### **Goals & Progress**

GTM Copilot V2 Development: Adam achieved 70% completion on onboarding experience designs despite designer availability constraints, with clear dependencies on GTMC design coordination. The internal access rollout is complete, positioning us for controlled external beta launch. Copilot V2 represents our flagship effort to unify disparate experiences that have historically limited adoption rates.

AI Agent Development: Gabe progressed to 50% on emailer iteration with engineering team now ready to take the prototype forward on the Agentic platform. However, output quality remains below human SDR standards, requiring systematic improvement against gold-standard email examples. The engagement insights prototype reached 25% completion, focusing on identifying the 4-5 critical questions users need answered about account-level engagement patterns.

Enterprise Infrastructure: David advanced admin-defined territories to 50% completion with successful beta customer onboarding and positive initial feedback. The territories system already integrates with workflows for routing, validating the technical approach. Priority accounts work reached 25% completion as engineering teams converge on GTM data model integration approach, though product alignment on search infrastructure access remains ongoing.

## **Strategic Challenges**

AI emailer quality represents our most immediate product risk - without achieving human-level output quality, users won\'t invest time iterating on generated emails, limiting adoption of this core Copilot capability. The current prototype surpasses existing emailer performance but falls short of best SDR output. Engineering handoff is proceeding, but we need parallel prompt optimization and systematic quality measurement against curated examples to reach acceptable standards.

Admin-defined territories faces resource contention as multiple engineering teams juggle competing priorities. The Ringlead team\'s delay on user summary page development pushes GA timeline while bulk upload testing encountered staging compatibility issues. Despite strong beta customer feedback, the feature needs consolidated ownership and streamlined development process to reach production readiness.

Cross-functional bottlenecks are emerging around design resources and GTM data model integration. Adam\'s V2 onboarding work is constrained by designer availability just as multiple teams swarm GTMC development. Simultaneously, David\'s priority accounts work depends on resolving how new GTM data model interfaces with existing search infrastructure, requiring alignment across Platform, Enterprise Search, and Apps teams.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The Intent Topic AI Recommendation launch validated our hypothesis that AI-driven setup can dramatically improve user experience - recommendations were immediately available post-launch rather than requiring manual configuration. However, the 30-60% relevancy rate suggests significant room for improvement through better recommendation algorithms and user feedback loops. This pattern should inform all future features requiring user setup.

UXR insights from Al Nevarez\'s advanced search interviews reveal a critical split in user preferences: large enterprise customers demand filter facets for precise control and evidence of search accuracy, while smaller customers prefer natural language interfaces. This suggests our advanced search evolution needs hybrid approaches rather than wholesale replacement of existing functionality. The popularity of chat-based search with persistent history indicates strong user appetite for conversational interfaces.

Mobile feature development exposed severe limitations in our people location data quality, forcing us to shelve a highly-requested mapping feature. This represents both a immediate product gap and a broader data quality challenge that affects customer satisfaction across multiple use cases. The \$2M+ renewals driven by mobile export features demonstrate the revenue impact of addressing field sales workflows effectively.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our collaboration with the Agentic platform team on emailer development is progressing smoothly with clear handoff protocols established. Gabe\'s prototype serves as the foundation while the email engineering team (X-Wing) continues development and enhancement. This partnership model should be replicated for other agent development initiatives.

Design resource allocation requires strategic coordination as Katya works intensively on Ant\'s profiles redesign while Sarah supports both Gabe\'s emailer designs and Al\'s advanced search prototyping. The upcoming GTM Copilot launch will intensify design demands, suggesting need for additional design capacity or more structured prioritization frameworks.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s priorities center on quality validation and external launch preparation. The Intent Topic AI Recommendation monitoring system goes live, providing our first comprehensive view of AI feature adoption patterns and user behavior. These insights will guide both immediate feature improvements and broader AI-first product development principles.

GTM Copilot rollout planning takes center stage with a phased approach targeting high-value renewals while managing support burden. The \$61M renewal pipeline through year-end requires aggressive rollout timeline balanced against feature request volume and team capacity. Success here establishes GTM Copilot as our primary growth driver and validates the unified experience approach.

Product review preparation for agentic profiles represents a key strategic milestone, positioning our vision for AI-powered account intelligence in front of executive leadership. Ant\'s work on next best actions, informed by learnings from previous \"recommended plays\" attempts, could differentiate us significantly if we nail the agentic framework approach. The combination of quality profile information presentation and actionable recommendations positions us as the market leader for actionable account intelligence.

Quality ranged from 86-96% deliverability, providing the Data Science team with robust feature engineering inputs for the new email generation model that will improve upon our current 72% deliverability rate (up from 67% in March).

Semantic Signal Development: Brandon Wilson mapped 95% of Account AI summary data sources, refresh rates, and coverage metrics, creating a consolidated reference that eliminates duplicate processing costs. This analysis enables direct integration with the Data Services API, significantly reducing latency and compute expenses for semantic-enhanced signals while improving accuracy through better context.

Agent Platform Expansion: Ethan Young progressed on analysis workflow agents despite team scaling challenges, while Jody Roberts secured dedicated engineering resources for shared services (one from PTI, one from Company team) with minimal roadmap impact. The shared services kickoff scheduled for Monday will accelerate data standardization and accessibility across R&D teams.

## **Strategic Challenges**

Vertical Dataset Pipeline Management: As we scale from 3 to 10+ vertical datasets, we face increasing complexity managing independent pipelines that must integrate with core company assets. Each dataset (restaurant, franchise, contractor) requires industry-specific attributes to influence company profiles, licensing considerations, and contract factors. Without architectural changes to Company 3.0, we risk creating unsustainable technical debt as pipeline maintenance scales non-linearly.

Agent Deployment Path Uncertainty: While we\'re building valuable agents for analysis workflows and data insights, the path to customer deployment remains unclear for both ZI Chat and the Agentic R&D platform. BigQuery/Snowflake connectivity limitations block several high-impact agents, and we lack clarity on how custom APIs or LLM-based normalizations will reach customers through Copilot 2.0 or GTM Studio without dedicated product roadmap alignment.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Company Infusion Quality Validation: The Rhetorik data analysis revealed 43% of URLs are inactive, causing profiles to be unpublished, but many represent valid small businesses (especially in Brazil) that simply lack working websites. This insight reshapes our pre-validation approach and suggests we need geography-specific quality thresholds rather than universal standards for company activation.

GTM Vertical Dataset Demand Validation: Training sessions confirmed strong seller confidence and customer interest in vertical datasets, but highlighted critical gaps in our enablement process and data readiness requirements. The high volume of follow-up questions indicates we need standardized messaging frameworks and self-service evaluation tools to scale effectively across our expanding dataset portfolio.

Email Deliverability Root Cause Analysis: Competitive health testing shows 96% deliverability for ReachOut contact patterns versus declining rates for bulk exports, confirming that employment status accuracy and contact freshness drive deliverability more than email generation algorithms. This suggests prioritizing contact lifecycle management over solely improving generation models.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the GTM teams on vertical dataset operationalization continues to be critical for achieving our \$10M H2 revenue target. Training completion and account targeting rollouts are proceeding smoothly, but data readiness for restaurant, franchise, and Form 5500 datasets requires accelerated development focus to meet field demand.

Platform team coordination remains essential for agent deployment pathways, as BigQuery/Snowflake connectivity gaps currently block customer-facing delivery of several high-impact data analysis and insights agents that could differentiate our GTM Studio and Copilot offerings.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on capitalizing on this week\'s company infusion breakthrough by analyzing unlocked contact opportunities and queueing additional LatAm companies for processing while advancing our second wave of geographic expansion targets.

Priority execution areas include: Dow Jones leading restaurant/franchise dataset GTM readiness with customer assets and use case development; Brandon Wilson implementing the Data Services API integration to dramatically reduce semantic signal processing costs and latency; Dana Hurtig completing analysis of the 1.4M contacts unlocked by new company additions and initiating our next DIP infusion cycle. Steve Hutchinson will finalize email source analysis handoff to Data Science for new model development, while Rob Priore advances the California/Oregon opt-out workflow technical implementation.

Strategic positioning: The successful DIP validation positions us to accelerate Company 3.0 planning discussions and vertical dataset pipeline optimization. With proven ability to scale company additions and strong GTM field response, we\'re positioned to exceed our H2 targets while building the foundation for 2026 geographic and vertical expansion opportunities.

# **Intelligence Team Executive Roundup - August 22, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The Intelligence Team achieved a major milestone with Paychex data going live in production while identifying scaling concerns across multiple MCP services that need attention before broader rollout. The team successfully consolidated efforts around the GTM context service with Ryan Stevens providing immediate team resources for Rowan, but billing infrastructure for AI credits remains in design phase only, creating risk for external launches planned for October.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Lars Vedo\'s team made significant progress on the no-code agent and artifact builder, with a demo scheduled to showcase how internal teams can test agents and toggle embed options in real-time. This directly addresses the proliferation challenge of having 5+ teams embedding chat across the organization.

Rowan Bailey successfully orchestrated the GTM context service kickoff, immediately securing resources from Ryan Stevens (Vinod, Carter, Topher, and Zheng) and establishing a clear promotion path from internal to external tool releases with Frank Shaw\'s MCP Gateway service design. The team exposed three new tools to the internal MCP, with more scheduled to be made available for use externally (e.g in Claude) by the end of next week.

Ryan Stevens achieved a 90% resolution of performance reliability issues by identifying and fixing critical Python layer bottlenecks that were causing synchronous blocking operations in loops, resulting in dramatically more consistent performance across staging environments.

### **Goals & Progress**

Platform Performance & Reliability: Ryan Stevens identified material problems in the Python layer where Pydantic initialization in loops was causing severe performance degradation. By profiling code and removing hotspots, the team eliminated agent-side throttling issues and achieved consistent performance. The team intentionally stressed staging to one server/process to replicate and diagnose issues more effectively.

Customer Rollout & Data Integration: Danny Pan successfully moved Paychex data to production and prepared data for over a dozen tenants in phases A, B, and C of the EA cohort rollout. However, the team noticed concerning ETL pipeline slowdowns that need investigation before full-scale deployment.

Context Service Architecture: Rowan Bailey is taking over requirements for account brief and summary updates and aligning these requirements with work on the GTM config side. The team established that admins should validate inferred context and fill gaps that cannot be determined from other sources, creating a more robust context foundation for agent responses.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The team faces an emerging scale crisis as Lars Vedo highlighted that multiple services being integrated via MCP may not be designed for the 200,000+ record volumes the platform will generate. Many endpoint creators don\'t realize the scale requirements, and there\'s no systematic review of rate limiting, throttling, or performance capabilities across integrated services.

Rowan Bailey identified that token monitoring and AI credit billing infrastructure remains in design phase only, while data access capabilities are ready for release. This misalignment between technical readiness and billing capability poses significant risk for the September/October external launch timeline.

The proliferation of MCP tools presents an orchestration challenge, with potentially hundreds of individual tool calls that the orchestrator must choose between. The team needs to solve semantic separation of descriptions and create dynamic short lists of relevant tools for given contexts before this becomes unmanageable.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The cross-team learning session between Lars Vedo, Rowan Bailey, Ryan Stevens and the ZI Chat team revealed that making artifacts and agents editable by end users has been their biggest unlock, with surprising insights about which users create the best artifacts. This validates the team\'s investment in the no-code builder approach.

Ryan Stevens\' performance investigation revealed that seemingly minor implementation choices in Python can have dramatic compound effects at scale. The Pydantic initialization issue demonstrates how language-specific optimizations that don\'t matter in other environments can become critical bottlenecks in production Python deployments.

The team discovered through the Paychex demo that staging environment decisions by other teams (Workbooks) can cascade into customer-facing impacts, highlighting the need for better cross-team coordination on demo environments and customer data handling protocols.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the GTM data store team on integrating semantic data continues to be critical for unlocking context capabilities across the platform. Danny Pan is coordinating data transfer next week, with the GDM team excited and actively preparing to receive our data - this integration will be a major unlock for making our semantic layer accessible to all GTM services.

The GTM config collaboration with Megan and Richie is progressing well, with Rowan Bailey aligning account brief and summary requirements to work backwards from key agent questions like competitive positioning and win/loss reasons. This coordination ensures admins can validate inferred context and fill critical gaps, creating a stronger foundation for agent responses. Ryan McMaster will continue this alignment next week after receiving Rowan\'s notes from the hour-long planning session.

The design systems team partnership on universal component creation, particularly around AI credit consumption patterns, is essential for consistent user experience across all our touchpoints. Ryan McMaster is addressing their confusion about how new AI credits differ from existing credit consumption, with a sync scheduled Monday to establish broader patterns that will benefit all teams implementing AI features.

The emailer team integration represents a successful collaboration model, with Lars Vedo\'s team unblocking Gabe to create their first cloned orchestrator agent for email generation. This team is now running at full speed and will soon demonstrate how our enhanced context layer improves messaging quality.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s focus centers on H2 roadmap realignment as Rowan Bailey noted that significant changes over the past month require clarity on September/October launch milestones across all teams.

The immediate priorities include conducting a systematic scale review of all MCP endpoints and services before broader rollout, accelerating the token monitoring and billing system design with Adam Smith\'s team to achieve feature parity with technical capabilities, and expanding the no-code agent builder to enable PMs and other non-technical users to test new MCP endpoints without engineering involvement.

The team will also prioritize getting semantic data into the GDM store as Danny Pan coordinates with the excited GDM team, representing a major unlock for data accessibility across the platform.

# **Semantic Data Team Executive Roundup - August 22, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The Semantic Data team successfully delivered Paychex data integration to ZDP this week while preparing infrastructure to scale from single-tenant to multi-tenant processing capabilities. Critical authentication work by Jon Seller unlocks the ability to onboard 5-10 new tenants next week, with GTM Store ready to receive data. The team must now accelerate tenant onboarding to support upcoming customer demos using production data rather than test environments.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Jon Seller completed the authenticated tenants infrastructure with functional authentication tokens and IDs, enabling secure pipeline access for multiple customers. This foundational work positions the team to scale from current single-tenant operations to supporting 12 tenants within weeks and 1,000 tenants within a month.

Inga Isakov\'s evaluation of signature-removed email processing confirmed consistent performance with lower token costs and reduced entity duplication. The removal of signature-related entities represents a clear win for data quality without compromising extraction accuracy.

Danny Pan successfully integrated Paychex data into ZDP, though still using Chorus API tokens pending passive login implementation. Paychex demonstrated the semantic data capabilities to a customer this week, validating market interest despite using ZoomInfo test data due to production readiness constraints.

### **Goals & Progress**

Data Pipeline & Integration: Paychex data successfully loaded into ZDP with processing capabilities demonstrated to customer stakeholders. ETL pipeline experiencing minor performance degradation that Danny is monitoring - not critical but trending in wrong direction. Team preparing to onboard 5-10 tenants next week as GTM Store awaits production data.

Infrastructure & Authentication: Authentication framework complete with token-based access control, though authorization for feature-level permissions requires additional alignment with UI and client teams. Jon established GCP staging sandbox environment and proof-of-concept for data streams, positioning team for DevOps-friendly scaling.

Data Quality & Evaluation: Email signature removal evaluation nearing completion with results showing reduced token usage and elimination of signature-related redundant entities. Inga completing final metrics compilation for Monday delivery while investigating entity type distribution for potential ontology optimization.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Authentication system currently provides binary on/off access without granular feature authorization, requiring alignment with Agendic and client app teams on licensing and permission models. Jon identified this gap while implementing tenant authentication - the infrastructure works but needs enhancement for production feature management.

ETL pipeline performance degradation, while minor, signals potential scaling challenges as the team prepares for rapid tenant expansion. D

nny noted the slowdown isn\'t critical yet but represents movement in the wrong direction just as volume requirements are increasing dramatically.

Production environment readiness remains incomplete, forcing customer demos to use test data rather than actual customer information. With Workbooks merging to production soon and customers expecting live demos, the team faces immediate pressure to establish production-ready data pipelines for multiple tenants.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Matt Kowalczyk\'s onboarding design exercise revealed critical gaps in automated customer onboarding processes that must be addressed before September\'s scaling targets. The team discovered that current manual processes won\'t support the expected customer volume, necessitating immediate automation efforts.

# **Context Engineering Team Executive Roundup - August 22, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The Context Engineering team achieved significant momentum this week with multiple workstreams converging toward a unified GTM context service architecture. Rowan Bailey secured the green light to enhance account brief and summary sections that generate 1.5M monthly views, while the team officially kicked off the go-to-market context service with a new engineering team ahead of October\'s Dreamforce showcase. Critical architectural decisions remain open regarding MCP tool hierarchy, but Sri Marthi has aligned the implementing team and established the foundation for signals-as-a-service capabilities.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

The MCP server initiative for signals gained substantial clarity with Sri Marthi completing 80% of his goal to draft and review implementation plans with Yvonne and Pankaj. This work will enable signals to become accessible and flexibly usable by any agent, addressing Brandon Tucker\'s feedback that current signal packaging is \"over the head of customers\" who struggle to understand specific signal applications.

Robyn Sablosky\'s APS (Account Propensity Scoring) API went live 8 days ago and is being immediately adopted by ZI Labs starting next week, providing a rapid feedback loop for iterations. The lookalike scoring models are showing strong early results, positioning the team to deliver more intelligent contact recommendations across multiple product surfaces.

The semantic data workstream delivered a successful demo to Paychex in staging, demonstrating on-the-fly attribute creation that could help save a potential Chorus churn risk. The customer understood the value proposition and expressed interest in joining the Early Access program, with next week\'s focus on getting semantic data into GTM Store to enable downstream signal generation.

### **Goals & Progress**

MCP Server Architecture: Sri Marthi advanced the signals MCP server documentation and implementation planning, completing initial alignment with the engineering team. Two critical open items remain: finalizing the tool hierarchy (how signals map to tools and whether to use a unified MCP server or separate ones per data type) and coordinating with Ryan Stevens\' team on division of responsibilities. This foundational work will determine how effectively signals can be packaged for customer consumption.

AI/ML Personalization Strategy: Robyn Sablosky identified significant gaps in product-level personalization capabilities, determining that current data is insufficient for machine learning approaches and LLM-based solutions would be \"a guess at best.\" She\'s documenting these limitations and developing a strategy document that distinguishes between basic personalization (knowing what accounts customers sell to) and advanced personalization (next best actions and sophisticated plays).

GTM Context Service Launch: Rowan Bailey\'s team received a new engineering squad to build ZoomInfo\'s MCP Gateway for Claude, with a mandate to equip as many core tools as possible before Dreamforce. This service will provide customers direct access to ZoomInfo\'s data offerings and specialized services through an external-facing MCP, representing a significant productization of the team\'s capabilities.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The lack of UX resources for Robyn\'s scoring and recommendation models creates uncertainty about the feedback loop and user experience design. Without clear understanding of how lookalike scoring will appear in the product UI, the team risks building capabilities that don\'t integrate smoothly into existing workflows. Robyn is exploring workarounds through Copilot chat interfaces as suggested by Rowan.

Cross-team coordination for the MCP architecture remains unresolved, with Sri needing to meet with Ryan Stevens\' team to clarify responsibilities between GSO and the platform teams. The decision on whether to wait for signals data in the GTM store versus building interim solutions could impact timeline and avoid deprecated work, as Rowan noted his preference to \"wait until it\'s in the store to avoid doing work that\'s gonna get deprecated a few weeks later.\"

Data consistency across multiple asset generation touchpoints poses a risk to user experience, as Christine highlighted concerns about account briefs, value propositions, and GTM config data potentially providing conflicting information. The team needs to ensure that scraped website data, admin-provided configuration, and generated content all align to maintain credibility.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The team discovered that signal packaging requires a fundamental rethink from technical capabilities to customer questions. As Sri learned from Brandon Tucker, current signal cubes are \"too specific\" - customers don\'t understand what to do with earnings signals presented in isolation. The solution involves grouping signals into broader business questions like market readiness, aligning technical tools with the questions customers actually want answered.

Rowan identified that the convergence of multiple workstreams - semantic data, GTM config, and account briefs - creates an opportunity for a unified data enrichment strategy. By treating GTM config as both a data collection and validation mechanism, the team can present inferred knowledge to admins and capture corrections, creating a feedback loop that improves all downstream applications.

Robyn\'s analysis revealed that true personalization will require cross-product agreement on data collection and experimentation strategies. The distinction between basic and advanced personalization provides a framework for prioritizing incremental improvements while working toward more sophisticated capabilities like next-best-action recommendations.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our collaboration with Ryan Stevens\' team on the MCP server architecture is critical for avoiding duplicate work and ensuring proper separation of concerns between the GSO team and platform engineering. Sri needs this coordination to finalize whether signal tools should be part of a unified MCP server or maintained separately.

The integration with ZI Labs for APS feedback creates a valuable testing ground for Robyn\'s models, but she also needs engagement from legacy product experts like Christine to identify and deprecate outdated models and ensure naming consistency across workbooks and other surfaces. This cleanup work is essential for creating the \"seamless product\" experience Robyn envisions.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week marks a pivotal transition as the team shifts from planning to execution across multiple fronts, with Rowan re-roadmapping H2 priorities to reflect the rapidly evolving landscape and newfound alignment across workstreams.

The immediate priorities include getting semantic data into GTM Store to unlock signal generation capabilities, finalizing the MCP tool hierarchy with Ryan Stevens\' team, and spinning up new MCP tools for testing in Claude Desktop. Robyn will focus on completing her AI/ML personalization strategy document while beginning UX conversations for workbooks integration, and Christine will develop the plan for transforming account briefs into comprehensive account plans that serve as a foundation for the React agent.

The team\'s momentum heading into next week reflects what Rowan described as \"a lot of these threads aligning\" - with semantic data, scoring models, MCP architecture, and GTM configuration all converging toward a cohesive platform that can power both internal tools and external customer experiences. The team is well-positioned to deliver meaningful demos and capabilities ahead of the October Dreamforce showcase.

# **Core Data Executive Roundup - Week of 08/18-08/22**

## **Executive Summary**

Shared Services resource planning was disrupted with Brian F. departure and engineering realignment but Magnus working toward resource allocation. Cam Fortin successfully shared an updated Company 3.0 transition business memo establishing a strategic roadmap to navigate the complex migration without customer disruption. Despite organizational turbulence, the team delivered on core commitments with Rituparna Das securing agreement on business email deliverability measurement standards that will improve data quality for high-value enterprise deals. Heather Ma achieved a breakthrough with the Benchmark Agent demonstrating contributory network\'s AI capabilities using opportunity data, while Peter Overman secured GTM Store dataset integrations and Hayden mobilized critical response to the public disclosure document pipeline deadline with only 6 weeks remaining until fiscal quarter-end reporting.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Company 3.0 Transition Strategy Progress: Cam Fortin created and reviewed a comprehensive business memo for the Company 2.0 to 3.0 transition, producing both detailed and executive-friendly versions that outline the migration risks and phased approach. The document addresses the critical gap where technical development was proceeding without fully fleshed-out business requirements, potentially averting a customer disruption disaster. This strategic framework now enables alignment across teams on why the transition is necessary and how to execute it safely.

Business Email Deliverability Standards Established: Rituparna Das secured agreement from Nilesh and Steve on measurement standards for business email deliverability, specifically excluding generic emails (like \"owner@localcoffeeshop\") from metrics. Her investigation revealed that a past dedupe process had inadvertently removed business emails from publishable contacts while retaining them on unpublishable ones - a systematic issue requiring engineering intervention to reassign emails properly. This discovery impacts database-wide email quality.

Shared Services Vision Despite Resource Constraints: Magnus Herweyer maintained momentum on the Shared Services initiative despite Brian Francesca\'s departure creating significant resourcing challenges. He successfully documented the address normalization location in web data acquisition\'s codebase and coordinated a Monday kickoff meeting with \"everyone and their uncle\" to launch the first phase. However, Casey\'s bandwidth evaporated as he pivoted to support the workbooks GA launch, and the NeverBounce team (under Vipin) is being transitioned to Kristen\'s organization, creating additional complexity in securing dedicated resources.

Contributory Network AI Agent Breakthrough: Heather Ma delivered a major milestone with the Benchmark Agent, successfully demonstrating win rate comparisons, performance rankings, and percentiles using opportunity data from customers on newer contract terms. This proof-of-concept establishes the foundation for advanced AI agents like Deal Velocity and Procurement Intelligence agents, capable of answering strategic questions like \"What\'s Puma\'s typical procurement timeline for SaaS solutions?\"

### **Goals & Progress**

GTM Store Third-Party Dataset Integration: Peter Overman completed handoff from Corina for GTM Studio frontend ownership, establishing himself as the end-to-end owner for third-party dataset integrations. He finalized the Form 5500 schema work and achieved quick wins with job posts backfill (2 days vs. 2 weeks estimated). His work on Xverum company data revealed opportunities to use LinkedIn member timestamps as proxies for employee growth over time. Concerns about the data marketplace strategy (monetization strategy and access model), were addressed in discussions with applications and data teams.

Public Disclosure Document Process Update: Hayden Cowell mobilized response to Ethan\'s critical escalation about the public disclosure document pipeline needed for fiscal quarter-end reporting to shareholders. With only 6 weeks until September 30th deadline and engineering estimating 3 sprints of work, Hayden secured An (from the data reliability team) as the dedicated resource. The pipeline calculates metrics like \"total volume of data points processed per day\" (1 billion+) - many currently done through \"napkin math\" that must be formalized. Additionally, MAT proposed taking ownership of the Scoops process, addressing the current gap where no team formally owns this news-based intelligence capability.

Contributory Network Architecture Decisions: Legal approval remains pending on whether to maintain CRM and other sources of data at the vendor level versus granular object level (e.g., only Contact because customer only enables Contact-related use cases) - a critical architectural decision impacting the entire contributory network strategy.

Contributory Network Data Pipeline Expansion: Following up on CPO\'s concerns about data ingestion gaps, the team completed investigation of 20M email signatures from Chorus and secured legal approval for two use cases: Email assessment and Contact enrichment. However, Contact enrichment requires building a new tile rather than grouping with CRM tiles. Beyond Chorus, opportunities exist to ingest data from a vast ecosystem including email and communication platforms (Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, Teams, Slack, Webex, Zoom), CRM and sales management systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, Gong, Outreach, Clari Copilot), talent platforms (Greenhouse, JazzHR, Bullhorn), marketing and intent data sources (LinkedIn, Google Ads, G2, SimilarWeb), and data infrastructure tools (Snowflake, various ZoomInfo products), though many pipelines require further development or investigation to understand current capabilities. The team has started creating a comprehensive artifact to catalog all these potential data sources, their current use cases, future use cases, and legal opinions - requiring several weeks to develop the complete landscape view. This holistic understanding of all possible datasets will be critical for inspiring new product ideas and use cases that could unlock significant value from previously untapped data sources before conducting impact analysis to prioritize pipeline development work.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Organizational Transition Creating Cascading Dependencies: Brian Francesca\'s departure with George taking his role has created a domino effect of resource reallocations. The email validation team (NeverBounce) is transitioning from Casey to Kristen over the next two months, Casey lost engineering bandwidth supporting workbooks GA, and John Durst must realign his roadmap as George transitions from IC to management. These shifts are blocking Magnus\'s Shared Services initiative at the critical architecture validation stage with Casey and Michael Helpse.

Contributory Network Data Volume Management Gap: John Durst\'s work revealed systemic issues in managing large-scale data ingestion. While the 100 million duplicate contacts only cost \$1,000 to process, the engineering time to triage was \"an order of magnitude more.\" The incident exposed gaps in coordination with data acquisition teams about acceptable volume thresholds and the need for upstream alerting when volumes exceed normal parameters. Privacy implications remain under investigation with Rob regarding potentially inappropriate data that may have been published.

GTM Store Monetization & Access Model Strategy: Peter Overman identified a lack of clarity on how entitlements will be applied to new datasets (e.g., at the source vs. enrichment/column level or by limiting the number of rows which can be enriched). Misalignment could delay customer-facing releases despite data readiness. After discussion, it was agreed that Peter will move forward to enable these datasets while Prateek builds the marketplace experience. The decision to gate behind a paywall will take place over-time, specific to each dataset and based on usage/insights (balanced against the positive overall usage impact from general availability).

Contributory Network Implementation Blockers: The Corp IT Salesforce team needs to accelerate implementation of a new CN flag supporting advanced use cases only available to customers on the newer contract version EULA_5_1_2025. This flag impacts downstream CN use cases and admin experiences - for example, Opportunity data access is only available to customers on the new contract version. Meanwhile, the team continues development and QA of the revamped data sharing page, building test use cases with target group testing scheduled for next week.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Google Contract Negotiation Reveals Technographics Opportunity: John Durst discovered that Google\'s contract renegotiation includes requests for 4-5 annual technographics updates on new domains they provide. While initially seen as a support burden, this represents an opportunity to identify new technologies and companies for acquisition while satisfying a major customer. This model could be replicated with other enterprise clients to crowdsource domain discovery.

Industry Classification Confidence Score Complexity: Cam Fortin\'s meeting on the new industry classification model revealed that data science still lacks clarity on confidence score implementation - a critical component that\'s making him \"nervous\" about delivery. The tension between leveraging unified models for both company data and vertical datasets while meeting distinct requirements threatens timeline commitments.

Documentation-as-Leverage Strategy: Peter Overman\'s bi-weekly \"flash report\" on GTM data store availability serves dual purposes - celebrating team wins while creating accountability mechanisms for platform teams. However, this is more of a challenge on the web data acquisition side. In response, he is working to develop clear source naming conventions and standardized impact reporting (yield, accuracy) to quantify the impact of each initiative and in aggregate.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our Shared Services initiative requires immediate executive intervention from Brandon to establish it as a strategic priority. Magnus needs a \"pre-pod\" structure where teams can contribute engineers without requiring all engineering leaders in recurring meetings. The slow sprint-by-sprint discovery process for address normalization requirements exemplifies why dedicated resources with clear mandates are essential.

The public disclosure document pipeline work requires coordination across Data Tools, Analysis, and manual processes currently spread across teams. Hayden\'s initiative to formalize Scoops ownership addresses a critical gap where news-based intelligence lacks clear accountability, potentially unlocking structured signals from unstructured news data that Peter Overman has identified as having \"so much juice to squeeze.\"

Contributory Network expansion depends on critical cross-organizational coordination. Legal approval remains pending on whether to maintain CRM and other sources of data at the vendor level versus granular object level (e.g., only Contact because customer only enables Contact-related use cases) - a critical architectural decision impacting the entire contributory network strategy. Additionally, the Corp IT Salesforce team\'s implementation of the new CN flag for EULA_5_1_2025 contract customers is blocking advanced contributory network features, requiring escalation to ensure timely delivery of opportunity data access and other premium capabilities.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on executing the Shared Services kickoff while managing organizational transitions and maintaining delivery momentum on critical customer commitments.

Magnus will leverage Monday\'s kickoff meeting to secure firm engineering commitments for address normalization as the first Shared Services offering. Rituparna will coordinate with DaaS team on the UKG deal requirements while initiating analysis on incremental value from combining 5x5 and BigDBM data for mobile advertising IDs and hashed emails. Peter will accelerate bulk company creation to support Cam\'s cube release, potentially adding domains from CRM backlogs to the 19 million already identified. John will complete roadmap realignment with George and Kristen while establishing clear thresholds for contributory network data volumes.

Heather will continue development of the revamped data sharing page with target group testing next week, while the team completes the comprehensive data source catalog to map the full contributory network ecosystem. This catalog work will enable impact analysis and prioritization of new pipeline development across the vast range of potential integrations from communication platforms to intent data sources. The team will also build the new Contact enrichment tile for Chorus email signatures and work toward resolving the pending legal architectural decisions that will unlock the full contributory network strategy.

The team must balance maintaining operational excellence during leadership transitions with advancing strategic initiatives that will define our competitive advantage in enterprise data management and intelligence delivery.

# **Product Ops Executive Roundup - 8/22/25**

## **Executive Summary**

The MCR release successfully deployed with all customer-facing materials, driving measurable demand and customer conversations. However, adoption remains critically low with only 4 uses of the personalized account roadmap, also low usage of the personalized release notes and transcript, indicating an urgent need for sales enablement intervention. Meanwhile, Sam Darcy\'s VOC deployment faces continued technical blockers around account filtering, though the knowledge graph infrastructure achieved a breakthrough by pivoting to neo4j with Ron\'s support.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Ken Elwell completed the full MCR package delivery, shipping personalized account roadmap and release notes agents alongside podcasts, implementation guides, and previews to customers.

Sam Darcy secured a significant infrastructure win by partnering with Ron to implement a rapid-based knowledge graph using neo4j instead of the original postgres approach. This pivot unlocks out-of-the-box features including document processing, deletion, update and validation that would have required weeks of custom development.

### **Goals & Progress**

Customer Release Execution: Ken Elwell delivered the complete MCR launch package on schedule, with all customer-facing materials successfully distributed and already driving demand conversations. Minor feedback from Dominik on V2 requires attention, but the core release is performing as intended, though low usage so far.

VOC Deployment Infrastructure: Sam Darcy\'s VOC tool functions end-to-end when querying all accounts, but account filtering remains blocked despite investigating MP server solutions that proved unavailable. The system can technically deploy today with basic functionality, though search results lack precision due to the broad universe constraint.

Knowledge Graph Architecture: The neo4j infrastructure pivot with Ron\'s collaboration represents 80% completion of the enhanced knowledge graph system. Integration with Josh MetaData\'s agent platform fork is pending approval for internal-use-only agents, but core functionality including automated document management will be ready by day\'s end.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Sales adoption gap threatens ROI on completed features. Despite shipping high-demand roadmap capabilities that sales teams requested for customer presentations, usage remains at 4 instances for the personalized account roadmap - a concerning disconnect between stated need and actual adoption. Feedback from the DaaS team confirms that enablement must aggressively push these tools to sellers, but the implementation strategy for driving adoption remains unclear.

Account filtering complexity is delaying VOC deployment beyond acceptable timelines. The MP server solution that was supposed to resolve doc filtering proved to be non-existent, forcing Sam Darcy back to the inefficient GTM store API approach. While the system works without filtering, the user experience suffers significantly from searching across too broad a universe, creating a trade-off between deployment speed and product quality.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The gap between seller demand and seller adoption reveals a fundamental enablement execution problem. Ken Elwell\'s data showing strong customer interest in roadmaps while seeing only 4 internal uses suggests that sales teams lack either awareness, training, or process integration for these tools. This pattern indicates that product delivery success doesn\'t automatically translate to revenue impact without deliberate adoption strategies.

Infrastructure flexibility accelerated progress after initial rigid approaches failed. Sam Darcy\'s willingness to pivot from postgres to neo4j with Ron\'s support demonstrates that architectural decisions should prioritize speed-to-value over theoretical optimization. The rapid framework provides immediate advanced features that justify the cost trade-off, especially at current scale.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the agent platform team on internal-use-only deployment policies could unlock immediate VOC tool availability. Josh MetaData provided the repository fork, but approval processes remain unclear, creating uncertainty around deployment timing when the core functionality is essentially complete.

The enablement team relationship requires executive attention to drive adoption of completed features. While technical delivery succeeded, the business impact depends on enablement actively pushing tools to sellers rather than assuming organic adoption will occur.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week prioritizes conversion of completed technical work into measurable business outcomes.

Ken Elwell will balance ongoing account manager slide development (previously deprioritized for MCR) with addressing Dominik\'s version two feedback and collaborating with enablement on adoption strategies. The focus shifts from feature completion to usage acceleration, requiring cross-functional coordination to unlock the value from shipped capabilities.

Sam Darcy faces a deployment decision point on the VOC tool - ship basic functionality immediately or continue optimizing the filtering experience. Given the extended timeline, executive guidance on the speed-versus-quality trade-off will determine whether to prioritize getting something live or maintaining development momentum toward the full vision. The knowledge graph completion provides a foundation for enhanced capabilities regardless of the VOC deployment decision.

# **Admin Team Executive Summary - August 18-22, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The team made significant progress on the AI price book, finalizing the packaging of vertical datasets, and completing the LoginAs discovery work. The single most important thing executives need to know is that while the AI price book requirements are 80% complete, a decision on reporting requirements for GTM Studio Release is critically needed to unblock final technical design. Brannen Huske, Jessie Lindstrom, and Josh Simon have all made key advancements, but the next steps for the AI price book initiative are dependent on input from Agentic Platform and Workbook team.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

The team successfully created a repeatable pattern for selling verticalized datasets, defining a new \"VDS\" namespace for entitlements in GTM Studio. Brannen Huske completed this goal, positioning us to drive revenue and support the company\'s \$10 million ACV revenue target by the end of the year.

Jessie Lindstrom\'s team advanced the AI price book requirements to 80% completion, obtaining target dates from engineering. This progress is a key step toward the ability to charge for AI credits by the October 1st deadline, and it is a testament to the team\'s ability to drive forward on a complex and emerging initiative.

Josh Simon finalized the LoginAs discovery process by shadowing CX teams and gathering passionate feedback from 82 respondents across various departments. The breadth of this feedback, coupled with interviews, provides the necessary data to move forward with a product review document that addresses both technical and organizational challenges.

### **Goals & Progress**

AI Price Book Initiative: The requirements for the AI price book are at 80% completion, with engineering dates targeted. The main remaining piece is to define the reporting requirements for GA, which is a blocker to the final technical design. Jessie Lindstrom\'s goal for next week is to get this feedback and schedule tickets in upcoming sprints.

LoginAs Discovery: Josh Simon\'s high-level goal was to finalize the LoginAs discovery, which he just about did. He has completed interviews and collected survey data, which will be consolidated into a product review document to be worked on with Brannen Huske in the next couple of weeks.

Vertical Datasets: Brannen Huske completed his high-leverage goal of finalizing the requirements for packaging vertical datasets at 100%. This was achieved by defining a repeatable pattern using a new \"VDS\" namespace that can support the addition and monetization of new datasets.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The AI price book technical design is blocked because a clear definition of reporting must-haves for GA is still being defined. This requires Agentic Platform and Workbook\'s input.

Josh Simon\'s discovery on the LoginAs project revealed a significant challenge: the feature has become so ingrained in the company culture that it is used as a \"crutch\" by most organizations for their job functions. This means the solution will require not only technical changes but also significant organizational and cultural management.

The persistent log-out issue that customers face may be solved by an HTTP-Only cookie, which is our leading theory. However, testing the solution requires reaching out to customers like HubSpot users to verify the fix on their systems, and the team is currently waiting on responses from those customers.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

A key learning from the AI price book work is that AI pricing is far more complex than initially assumed, with many levers to pull beyond just margin. The market is still figuring this out, and our team must be comfortable with the unknowns and be agile in our response. Jessie Lindstrom noted that AI pricing is even more variable and volatile than traditional pricing, which will require frequent and stringent review.

The discovery on the LoginAs work revealed that product managers have become \"lazy\" by relying on the feature as a crutch instead of creating proper back-office mechanisms. This insight confirms that the problem is not just technical but also requires a change in how we build products to support back-office users.

Brannen Huske learned that creating a centralized platform for LLM and token calculation, as is being done for the AI price book, reduces redundant logic across different agentic platforms. This validates the strategic decision for a centralized model and highlights the benefit of a single platform area for these calculations.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

The work on the AI price book is dependent on the Agentic team to clarify whether they will be sending usage data in credits or USD. This decision directly impacts whether a conversion service is needed for the price book. A TPM is leading a meeting this week to get this resolved.

## **Looking Ahead**

Our primary focus for next week is to finalize key requirements to unblock development and set the stage for a smooth Q4 execution.

Jessie Lindstrom will finalize the AI price book reporting requirements to close out the design and schedule tickets for the next sprint, ensuring that work can begin while she is on PTO. Brannen Huske will continue to work with Josh Simon on finalizing the LoginAs product review document. This is a critical next step to schedule a product review and continue to move the initiative forward.

The team\'s work this week has provided clear next steps for our key initiatives. While challenges remain, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic goals and continue to provide value.
