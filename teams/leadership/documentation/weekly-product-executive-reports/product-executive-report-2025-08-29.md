*For detailed questions about any item below, reference specific team reports or contact team leads directly.*

## **Executive Summary**

### **Update on Previous Week Blockers**

**GTM Data Model coverage gaps creating customer impact across multiple products:** Integrations Team achieved \"Engagement Architecture Breakthrough\" with Sanyog Rai resolving longstanding ETL process issues that were \"identifying that Outlook meeting cancelation events were being omitted from the Chorus ETL process.\"

**Sales enablement adoption disconnect threatening ROI on completed AI features:** Partial progress made with Product Operations team achieving initial traction through Henry\'s company-wide email generating \"30-40 additional uses before plateauing,\". Too many links are being sent to GTM teams, which creates noise rather than value. Workflow integration is essential since \"reps preparing for meetings won\'t add extra steps unless tools are seamlessly integrated into their existing workflow.\" Next step requires coordination with enablement teams to solve workflow integration challenges

### **Current Week Update**

**Blockers:**

- **Production quality gaps exposing systematic testing inadequacies across AI features:** SalesOS/Copilot team uncovered \"three critical production bugs that had bypassed QA testing\" in Intent Topic AI recommendations, requiring \"P1 issues to engineering and data science teams\" while revealing \"systematic QA failures that allowed critical production issues to reach customers, requiring process improvements beyond immediate P1 fixes.\"

- **AI credit implementation timeline compression creating October launch risk:** User-Provisioning team flags \"AI credit technical implementation timelines end September with minimal buffer before launch expectations\" while Admin team decisions on \"reporting requirements for GTM Studio Release is critically needed to unblock final technical design,\" creating convergent deadline pressure across monetization infrastructure.

**Momentum areas:**

- **Major customer validation breakthrough with production AI capabilities demonstrating market readiness:** GTM Studio team achieved \"exceptional 87.1% average goal completion with standout performances\" while reporting \"10 active customers expanding to 25-30 by mid-September,\" and Semantic Data team successfully delivered \"Paychex data going live in production\" with Context Engineering team achieving \"Top Contacts delivering a \~50--64% relative lift over selecting only the buying group.\"

- **Strategic partnership expansion unlocking significant revenue opportunities:** DAI team secured \"follow-up meetings with Chris Billmeyer, EVP of Sales Cloud, after successful initial discussions about tightly integrating ZI data into Salesforce CRM,\" while ZIM team achieved \"October 28th ZoomInfo destination launch confirmed for Adobe DX and DME teams\" and Data Platform team established \"monthly Data Platform Review cadence starting September, creating execution rhythm needed for improved scope and timing communication.\"

**Bottom line:** AI capabilities are demonstrating strong production readiness and customer validation with multiple teams achieving breakthrough results, but systematic quality gaps and compressed monetization timelines require immediate executive attention to prevent customer impact and ensure successful October pricing launch.

### **Operational Velocity (Operating at AI-company speed vs SaaS speed)**

**Product Operations:** \"The team made continued progress on automating the flow of information from product to our GTM teams and customers: Ken Elwell delivered account-specific agents including the vertical datasets/ELA 7x7 reporting tool for Laser and AM deck creation capabilities (though adoption challenges need further exploration), Kristin Gandini streamlined MCR processes with improved transparency and simplified requirements, and Daniel Kong automated implementation guide updates while piloting AI-first personalized guides with Andres Perez. Separately, Sam Darcy achieved significant VOC improvements by leveraging the Agentic platform and new GTM store API, enabling immediate deployment for PM testing.\"

**Automation:** \"Architectural insights reshape integration strategies while API dependency challenges emerge across platform initiatives. Marc Frail discovered that Copilot Pro functions as a data view rather than a database, fundamentally changing the Workbook integration approach from data transfer workflows to data source exposure patterns. Sam Massie completed action library discovery requirements but identified that unpublished Workbooks APIs could block workflow integration progress. Meanwhile, the website trigger strategy pivoted toward centralized GTM Store integration, demonstrating platform evolution but creating new cross-team dependencies.\"

**User-Provisioning:** \"This week, the User-Provisioning team made significant progress on the solution for estimating, charging, and tracking AI Action Credits. A major win was the decision to consolidate the AI Pricebook and AI Credit Service into a single, centralized service, which does add scope, but simplifies the design for reporting. Meeting the October 1st deadline with the evolving requirements is aggressive, but the additional time on design is important to get this right. Additionally, Josh Simon completed the initial requirements for the new Audit Service, which is a foundational step toward improving customer trust and security and sunsetting the current LoginAs solution.\"

**Business Intelligence:** \"Bottom Line: Despite most team members being out this week, we achieved a major strategic breakthrough---Nanxi\'s retention analysis uncovered counterintuitive customer behavior that challenges core assumptions about contract lifecycle engagement. Usage actually increases toward contract end for both renewal and churn groups, with renewers showing significantly higher adoption spikes than churners. This finding could fundamentally reshape our renewal strategy timing. Additionally, Eran delivered strong progress on his partial week back from PTO, identifying March Networks as our ideal GTM case study with quantified 8-day annual savings, while Ferrell advanced integration tracking despite reduced team capacity.\"

### **Individual Team Reports**

**SalesOS/Copilot Team Weekly Report - August 25th - August 28th, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The team successfully launched Intent Topic AI Recommendation to production while uncovering critical revenue leakage worth potentially \$1M+ annually from uncontrolled custom topics. Harinath Krishnamoorthy identified multiple production issues in the recommendation system and secured buy-in from Carlos (GTM Strategy) to prioritize automated deprovisioning fixes. Meanwhile, profiles for GTMC are progressing strongly with Ant Cuomo and new designer Lindsay Bongo creating a clean-slate approach focused on bird\'s-eye intelligence views, while mobile Chat V2 prototyping begins in September to surface gaps and dependencies early.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Intent Recommendation Launch Reveals System Gaps**: Harinath Krishnamoorthy completed a comprehensive analysis of Intent Topic AI recommendations across enterprise customers (Brex, Monday.com, Twilio, Freshworks, JFrog, Neo4j), discovering the feature achieved 30-60% relevancy while uncovering three critical production bugs that had bypassed QA testing. The investigation revealed unauthorized platform runs, incorrect scheduling frequencies, and data discrepancies that were immediately escalated as P1 issues to engineering and data science teams.

**GTMC Profiles Architecture Breakthrough**: Ant Cuomo partnered with designer Lindsay Bongo to create a foundational design approach that prioritizes information architecture and bird\'s-eye intelligence over traditional module-heavy interfaces. The team established \"follow contact\" functionality that integrates with S2A engine for breaking alerts, creating a competitive advantage in contact-level signals that can automatically generate targeted contact views for users.

**Mobile V2 Agentic Explorations**: The mobile team secured dedicated September sprint capacity to prototype Chat V2 integration, specifically identifying gaps and dependencies in the agentic platform for native mobile experiences. Ant Cuomo structured this as a two-sprint exploration to build field sales-specific agents while creating a comprehensive dependency list for Lars\'s team, positioning mobile as a critical early adopter rather than an afterthought.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Intent Platform Stabilization**: Production quality issues were systematically addressed with three P1 tickets filed covering unauthorized tenant runs, daily vs. weekly scheduling conflicts, and data pipeline discrepancies. Engineering and data science teams acknowledged these issues with fixes scheduled for early next week, while a comprehensive 16-section support document was created to prevent downstream customer escalations and enable smoother adoption.

**Revenue Leak Mitigation**: Custom topic deprovisioning automation gained executive support from Carlos (GTM Strategy team), who confirmed the potential \$1M+ annual revenue leak and committed to prioritizing the initiative. Harinath Krishnamoorthy is working with Josh from the custom topic team and Salesforce engineers to quantify exact revenue impact through data analysis, building a compelling case for immediate implementation of package-level cluster limits.

**Copilot V2 Onboarding Foundation**: Adam Severance progressed the GTMC onboarding prod review to 70% completion, focusing on persona-based homepages and first-time user experience design. However, design resource constraints required strategic prioritization of emailer functionality over advanced search capabilities for the November timeline, creating a more focused but potentially limited initial V2 experience.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Design Resource Bottleneck**: Multiple teams are converging on GTMC development simultaneously, creating significant design capacity constraints that forced difficult prioritization decisions. Adam Severance encountered multiple handoffs between Megan, Whitney, and Katya before securing design support, while the team had to deprioritize advanced search V2 development to focus resources on higher-impact emailer functionality. This bottleneck threatens November delivery timelines and may require executive intervention to reallocate design resources or adjust scope expectations.

**Advanced Search Migration Complexity Requires Strategic Decision**: David Goulden\'s priority accounts initiative faces uncertainty around the advanced search migration to GTM data model, with multiple engineering teams still investigating feasibility and backward compatibility requirements. The migration affects existing saved searches, CRM filters, and downstream services, while customer renewal success depends on minimizing disruption to current Sales OS workflows. This requires immediate architectural decisions to prevent feature development paralysis.

**Production Quality Gaps Exposing Testing Inadequacies**: The Intent recommendation launch revealed systematic QA failures that allowed critical production issues to reach customers, including unauthorized platform runs and incorrect scheduling logic. While these specific issues are being addressed, the root cause analysis points to broader testing protocol gaps that could impact future feature rollouts and customer trust, requiring process improvements beyond the immediate P1 fixes.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Customer-First Analysis Reveals Hidden System Issues**: Harinath Krishnamoorthy\'s deep-dive analysis of enterprise customer recommendation quality exposed production problems that weren\'t caught during development testing, demonstrating the value of real customer data validation over synthetic testing scenarios. The discovery process required piecing together insights from scattered Snowflake data and direct production queries, revealing that current analytics tooling isn\'t optimized for rapid customer issue diagnosis during feature rollouts.

**Mobile-First Agent Design Opens New Market Opportunities**: Ant Cuomo identified that 30% of the market represents field/territory sales requiring mobile-first experiences, with specific use cases like daily summary agents and location-based contact mapping that differentiate from desktop-centric workflows. The September sprint approach of building native mobile agents while documenting platform gaps creates a foundation for capturing this market segment that competitors may overlook.

**Template-Based Configuration Consistently Fails Enterprise Adoption**: Victor Oliveros reinforced the pattern that admin-configured templates fail in enterprise software, citing decades of Salesforce experience where admins lack UX design skills and bandwidth for complex setup tasks. This insight validates the agentic approach for both company profiles and territory setup, suggesting that AI-driven configuration could become a key competitive differentiator against traditional enterprise software approaches.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Engineering teams on Intent platform stability continues to be critical for maintaining customer trust during the recommendation feature rollout. Three P1 issues are currently being addressed by both engineering and data science teams, with production fixes expected early next week and systematic QA process improvements needed to prevent similar issues in future releases.

The mobile team\'s September sprint on Chat V2 integration will provide essential feedback to Lars and the agentic platform team about native mobile requirements. Early identification of SDK needs, artifact limitations, and performance requirements will inform platform development priorities and prevent mobile from becoming a reactive afterthought in the GTMC rollout timeline.

## **Looking Ahead**

**Platform Stability and Process Improvement Focus**: Next week prioritizes completing the Intent recommendation production fixes while implementing systematic QA improvements to prevent similar issues. The team will finalize revenue leak analysis with Carlos and begin technical implementation planning for custom topic control mechanisms, turning a discovered problem into a revenue protection opportunity.

**Design Capacity Optimization and Mobile Prototyping**: With GTMC profiles entering design review and mobile prototyping beginning, the focus shifts to optimizing design resource allocation across competing priorities while ensuring the mobile team\'s September sprint generates actionable platform requirements. Adam Severance will complete the GTMC onboarding prod review template while navigating the advanced search vs. emailer prioritization decisions that impact November delivery scope.

The team demonstrated strong problem-solving capabilities this week, turning production issues into improvement opportunities while maintaining forward momentum on strategic initiatives. The combination of immediate tactical fixes and longer-term architectural planning positions us well for sustainable growth while protecting existing revenue streams.

**DAI Team Weekly Report - August 25th-29th, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Critical Action Required: We need unified executive messaging and campaign orchestration across our four major H2 initiatives by September 2nd to avoid enablement chaos and missed revenue targets. The September 25th launch timeline has zero buffer, with AI credit implementation racing against customer expectations. Sneh Kakileti reports strong Studio momentum with 13 customers ramping to 30, but Victor Oliveros has identified a fundamental flaw: Copilot V2\'s value is buried behind advanced prompts when sales leaders demanded zero-admin, instant-value experiences for renewal success.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Salesforce Partnership Breakthrough**: Ali Sadat secured follow-up meetings with Chris Billmeyer, EVP of Sales Cloud, after successful initial discussions about tightly integrating ZI data into Salesforce CRM. They\'re drafting a letter of intent and planning design sessions, representing a potential paradigm shift from vendor to embedded partner across their Sales Cloud platform.

**Studio Customer Validation**: Sneh Kakileti has 13 customers actively using Studio with strong trajectory toward 30 by month-end. Customer feedback reveals critical insights - they\'re successfully building AI-driven assets but struggling with seller activation workflows, emphasizing why Copilot integration and AI Emailer become essential for Q4 success.

**Contributory Network Infrastructure**: Brandon Tucker delivered a working CN knowledge base agent and completed foundational data processing for Restaurant, Contractor, and Franchise datasets. The \$10M+ vertical data opportunity now has concrete delivery mechanisms with customers already receiving contractor cube data.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Go-to-Market Alignment**: Victor Oliveros is finalizing the 90-day Copilot V2 rollout plan with sales-shareable documentation by Wednesday. However, internal roadshows revealed that sales leaders want zero-configuration, immediate-value experiences rather than feature-rich platforms requiring training and setup.

**Technical Architecture Clarity**: Adam Smith is mapping the complete inference pipeline from model vendors to end users, identifying credit utilization tracking, service owners, and bottlenecks. This addresses background anxiety about production readiness as multiple AI services come online simultaneously.

**PMM Engine Scaling**: AJ Belen achieved 80% progress on unified enablement planning across Copilot V2, GTM Studio, AI Context Layer, and Vertical Datasets. The team identified that enablement success requires prescriptive milestone-based approaches rather than traditional feature-by-feature rollouts.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Copilot V2 Value Discovery Problem**: Victor\'s roadshows exposed a critical flaw - despite tremendous underlying value, users must dig through advanced prompts to find benefits. Sales leaders explicitly stated that admin-light, instant-value experiences are the primary differentiator for renewals, directly contradicting current product direction.

**Campaign Orchestration Crisis**: Multiple teams are operating independently on interconnected initiatives, creating mixed messaging risks. AJ Belen and Sneh Kakileti identified that enablement was planning Studio-only approaches when success requires coordinated narrative across all four H2 initiatives.

**AI Credit Implementation Buffer**: Sneh flagged that AI credit technical implementation timelines end September with minimal buffer before launch expectations. This creates risk that pricing and consumption tracking won\'t be ready when customers expect to purchase new AI capabilities.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Human-in-the-Loop Reality**: David Chon\'s design research revealed that even \"fully automated\" AI plays require human checkpoints for quality control and parameter adjustments. The team needs to design for the spectrum from high human input to full automation rather than pursuing black-box automation that customers won\'t trust or adopt.

**Seller Activation Gap**: Studio customers are building valuable AI assets but lack best practices for getting recommendations, talking points, and call scripts to their sellers. This isn\'t just a technical capability gap - customers need guidance on workflow integration, creating opportunities for our enablement and professional services teams.

**Conservative Engineering Tension**: David highlighted ongoing challenges where engineering partners default to safe, familiar solutions versus pushing innovation boundaries. This creates a fundamental tension between breakthrough AI-native experiences and reliable, proven approaches that may limit competitive differentiation.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Salesforce on deeper CRM integration continues building momentum beyond current partnership scope. Ali Sadat\'s discussions with Victor Liu on Sales Cloud product integration represent potential expansion from data provider to platform capability embedded in their core workflows.

The September Studio launch depends heavily on integrations and connectors team capacity for customer exports and activations. Sneh identified this as a scaling bottleneck that could limit customer growth even with strong product-market fit validation from early adopters.

## **Looking Ahead**

**Unified Campaign Launch**: The highest priority is creating cohesive messaging and rollout strategy across Copilot V2, GTM Studio, AI Context Service, and Vertical Datasets before September enablement kicks off. This requires executive alignment on target accounts, success metrics, and coordinated positioning rather than four independent product launches.

Adam Smith\'s inference architecture documentation will address production readiness concerns and clarify credit utilization patterns across our AI services. Meanwhile, Victor focuses on solving the Copilot V2 value discovery problem through instant-access features and guided experiences that demonstrate benefits without requiring user sophistication.

The team must balance innovation ambition with execution reliability as we approach customer-facing launches. David\'s insights about human-in-the-loop requirements and engineering conservatism suggest we need clear product philosophy decisions about automation levels and technical risk tolerance before development acceleration.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Marc Delurgio successfully established the foundation for improved team communication by creating the Data Platform Monthly Review framework, securing stakeholder buy-in on the format, and the GTM Data Platform team drafting 50% of inaugural content for Thursday\'s launch. Huge thanks to Keerti Nandihalli for stepping up for TPM coordination for this! This new monthly cadence will demo successes, celebrate team achievements, and communicate priorities with engineering and PM leadership across the organization.

Linda Johannessen drove significant schema readiness progress by completing engineering reviews with no red flags identified, finalizing new entity templates, and updating the Data Catalog to automatically capture richer metadata at ingestion. This foundational work directly enables no-code dataset activation flows and improves both agent and user experiences across Workbooks and Data Catalog sales pages.

Menna Rashwan and the search team achieved full completion on Federated Search requirements for Workbooks September GA, ensuring Phase 1 Signals use cases for signal-based workbook creation and enrichment, plus Partner Data job posting enrichment, are fully supported on staging and ready for stakeholder validation.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Monthly Review & Communication**: Marc established the complete framework for the inaugural Data Platform Monthly Review launching Thursday, with overview slides, templates finalized, and 50% of content drafted by the team. Stakeholder interviews with 8 PM and engineering leaders confirmed enthusiastic alignment for this new communication rhythm that will demo monthly successes and set forward priorities.

**Unified Profiles Integration**: Adwait made progress on critical design alignment for Unified Profiles but identified the need for broader stakeholder engagement beyond the design team and dedicated engineering resources to regain technical momentum. Key insight: The reality of Unified Profiles now requires comprehensive alignment with both design leadership and product teams responsible for Contact and Company profiles to ensure seamless integration across ZI applications.

**Everstring Migration**: Moshik continued documenting technical differences between Everstring and Match Service, achieving 80% progress while identifying one Everstring-only output field requiring customer contact. Critical finding: only a single account appears to be using the non-portable fields, significantly reducing migration risk for the November timeline.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The Unified Profiles initiative faces a coordination challenge where Adwait discovered that beyond design team alignment, stronger awareness and product team coordination is essential since Unified Profiles represents a major shift in how customers use ZI products. Without comprehensive stakeholder alignment including design leadership and profile-owning product teams, there\'s risk of disconnected effort and poor adoption.

Advanced Search agent development revealed architectural complexity around multi-tenant workflows and UI integration. Menna identified that while the current agent supports basic prospecting scenarios, surfacing it within Advanced Search UI requires wrapping with other agents (Chat and Display) for complete user experience. A strategic question emerged about whether to continue building the current Advanced Search agent or pivot focus to Federated Search, which better aligns with long-term vision.

Match Service migration uncovered input manipulation differences that require additional stakeholder review before approval, though logs indicate minimal customer impact. Moshik needs another approval round and must verify the single account using Everstring-only fields, but overall technical differences appear manageable for November deployment.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The metadata capture enhancement at ingestion significantly expands the value proposition of existing APIs while enabling no-code activation flows that weren\'t previously possible. Linda\'s work on schema templates reveals that capturing richer metadata upfront creates compound benefits across multiple product surfaces, from improved agent responses to better customer self-service in the Data Catalog.

Advanced Search architecture decisions illuminate the complexity of embedding conversational AI into existing workflows. Menna\'s analysis shows that while individual agents can handle specific use cases, creating integrated user experiences requires careful orchestration between multiple AI components, with potential overlap concerns around existing Co-Pilot functionality that need resolution.

Cross-functional dependency patterns are emerging where individual team progress depends heavily on alignment sessions with leadership from multiple disciplines. Both Unified Profiles and Advanced Search initiatives require coordination across design, product, and engineering leadership to avoid rework and ensure adoption success.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on executing the inaugural Data Platform Monthly Review on Thursday while advancing critical stakeholder alignment sessions for Unified Profiles and finalizing Everstring migration documentation.

Priority actions include the GTM Data Platform team finalizing Monthly Review content and delivery, Adwait conducting working sessions with PM and design leadership to ensure alignment on Unified Profiles app integration requirements, and Moshik completing match insights mapping reviews with Data Advisory and Services teams. Linda will share finalized schema templates with data producers and move toward production readiness. The Advanced Search vs Federated Search strategic decision requires investigation of Workbook chat agent integration options to inform near-term exposure strategy.

The team is well-positioned to deliver value across communication improvements, foundational infrastructure, and customer-facing capabilities while maintaining focus on November milestone commitments and Workbooks September GA readiness.

**Integrations Weekly Report - Week of 20250825**

## **Executive Summary**

Sanyog\'s team reached 500 tenants now enabled for email/calendar with automatic GTM contact creation. Erica continued end-to-end testing for GTM custom fields while finalizing grooming for H2 features ahead of maternity leave (Congrats!). Prateek integrated Account AI Summary with Agentforce (DEMO Available) and demonstrated significant impact through ADA Bot POC (DEMO Available) in addition to driving progress on Vertical Data Set marketplace.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Erica\'s multi-channel CRM update campaign clarified the benefits to all features that migrate to GTM DM, and started to build clarity into where teams are today, and which teams are missing a migration plan.

Prateek integrated Account AI Summary with Agentforce (DEMO Available) and demonstrated significant impact through ADA Bot POC (DEMO Available), which is available behind a feature flag and should replicate the success the login support team saw where implementation on login page drove 80% reduction in support tickets.

Sanyog\'s team enabled email and calendar data for 500 tenants despite laptop security lockouts and provider API challenges, establishing the foundation for downstream applications to leverage engagement data in GTM Data Model for improved ROI reporting and cross-platform analysis.

### **Goals & Progress**

**CRM Data Migration**: Backend infrastructure for custom field to standard object mapping completed and deployed to production Monday. End-to-end testing continues with some environmental challenges, but the system is ready for customer onboarding with manual backend configuration if needed. Team 6 is transitioning to product and opportunity line items next sprint while maintaining flexibility to prioritize custom objects based on customer adoption patterns.

**Dataset Marketplace Development**: Prateek aligned with Linda\'s team on API requirements for both internal and external marketplace functionality. Development team has clear directive to create initial visualization using current APIs within one week, even without complete metadata, to demonstrate workflow and gather feedback. October delivery target remains on track despite holiday delays pushing enterprise customer discovery calls to post-Labor Day.

**GTM Data Model Adoption**: Migration tracker showing improved visibility into use cases and data source dependencies, though still primarily text-based rather than dashboard format. Asaf is working on converting this to actionable metrics with proper tenant counts from Mongo. The AI account summary team transition is providing cleaner alignment on GTM data model API usage as the North Star architecture.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Testing environment instability is impacting custom field validation due to multiple historical Salesforce connections creating data cross-contamination in workbooks. The challenge stems from inability to purge old data without breaking existing customer workbooks, requiring Erica to establish entirely new custom field configurations. This pattern reveals a broader need for clean environment management and customer instance migration processes.

Advanced search dependency mapping remains unclear as teams prepare for Org Import pipeline deprecation. While the migration tracker provides use case visibility, the transition plan for 40,000 customers currently using advanced search requires coordinated communication and technical support.

Cross-team coordination on master suppression lists is surfacing architectural decisions about whether opt-out data should remain in separate datasets or integrate directly into GTM Data Model. This impacts workbook functionality for contacts without ZoomInfo IDs and requires resolution before advanced search migration can proceed without customer impact.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Testing revealed that multiple CRM instance connections create downstream workbook dependencies that prevent data cleanup, highlighting the need for proactive customer migration processes. Erica\'s discovery that purging historical Salesforce data would break existing workbooks demonstrates the importance of designing clean separation between customer environments from the beginning.

Account matching logic requires fundamental improvement as current hard-coded rules are failing to associate activities with correct opportunities, particularly impacting MEDIC data accuracy. The assumption about latest close dates correlating with newest opportunities doesn\'t reflect actual sales patterns, where activity typically intensifies near deal closure rather than at opportunity creation. Sanyog plans to extend AAT logic to customers to solve this.

The shift from schema service to GTM Store APIs represents a critical architectural migration that all app teams must complete. Prateek\'s discussions revealed that workbook team and other application teams built dependencies on the Global Mapping Service that now need systematic migration to maintain filtering and relationship identification capabilities.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the workbook team on custom field implementation continues to be critical for September 1st delivery commitments. Current testing challenges require collaboration on data purging processes and environment isolation to prevent customer impact during development phases. The team needs support in establishing cleaner testing workflows that don\'t interfere with production workbook configurations.

Coordination with Linda\'s GTM Store team is essential for marketplace API development and broader data architecture decisions about where to persist GTM config information. The Wednesday meeting with Adi\'s team will determine storage strategies for messaging, positioning, buyer personas, and competitor data that impact multiple product development streams.

## **Looking Ahead**

September 1st represents a critical milestone for custom field delivery that enables broader Oregon Port deprecation planning and customer migration communications.

The team will focus on completing custom field end-to-end validation through new testing configurations. Sanyog will share an Engagement update mirroring the one Erica shared. Prateek will drive dataset marketplace UI execution while conducting enterprise discovery calls with Red Hat and ADP to identify high-value Agentforce use cases. Sanyog will complete email/calendar enablement for remaining tenants and develop the account matching PRD that leverages AAT configurability for improved opportunity association accuracy. The focus on systematic migration away from legacy pipelines positions the team to deliver on 2025 consolidation goals while maintaining customer experience quality.

**Semantic Data Team Weekly Report - Week of 08/25-08/29**

## **Executive Summary**

The Semantic Data team achieved critical progress on the passive login service implementation despite complex environment challenges, positioning us to dramatically reduce intelligence extraction SLAs from 48 hours to potentially sub-1 hour once GTM store integration completes in September. Rowan Bailey\'s context layer initiative has gained executive sponsorship as a sellable service targeting Dreamforce, while the team\'s semantic data capabilities are now powering workbook creation features - demonstrating clear product-market fit for our intelligence infrastructure.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Matt Kowalczyk and Danny Pan cracked the passive login service authentication puzzle, navigating complex network ACL restrictions and environment-specific token requirements to unlock multi-tenant onboarding capabilities. Despite the technical debt of incongruent dev/stage/prod endpoints, they\'ve established a working solution that eliminates the security risks of individual tenant tokens while we await the GTM store transition.

The context layer initiative accelerated with Rowan Bailey completing the strategic framework document and gaining alignment on external service architecture. This positions the semantic data team as a revenue-generating center rather than just an internal capability, with MCP tool integration and safe external exposure paths now defined for the October Dreamforce deadline.

Inga Isakov advanced the iteration evaluation framework, resolving environment blockers with Danny\'s assistance and preparing for large-scale testing of 1000 threads. This computational intelligence work directly feeds into our ability to analyze customer engagement patterns at scale, creating the foundation for predictive insights.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Passive Login Service Integration**: Matt and Danny achieved 90% completion on the passive login implementation, with production environment functionality confirmed and working authentication flows established. While lower environments require additional auth steps through external endpoints, the core capability is operational and ready for tenant onboarding once we navigate the remaining network ACL permissions.

**Context Layer Productization**: Rowan completed the strategic documentation and architectural planning for exposing the context layer as an external service, with specific focus on data requirements, MCP endpoint design, and security considerations. The initiative has moved from concept to execution phase with clear technical requirements and business justification documented in a Claude artifact shared with the team.

**Semantic Data Platform Expansion**: The team successfully clarified integration pathways for the workbooks team, distinguishing between the ask endpoint and search endpoints while establishing clear scaling boundaries. Jon Seller and the team identified that current endpoints serve as proof-of-concept showcases rather than production infrastructure, with GTM store integration as the proper scaling path.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The passive login service implementation revealed significant architectural debt in how our environments communicate with external services. Matt Kowalczyk identified that Chorus only accepts production tokens while DevOps restricts cross-environment access, forcing the team to implement workarounds through external endpoints requiring additional JWT authentication. This adds complexity to what should be straightforward service-to-service communication and highlights the need for unified authentication architecture.

Resource allocation tension emerged between investing engineering hours in the passive login service versus waiting for the GTM store integration expected in September. Danny Pan noted the risk of building dependencies while acknowledging the alternative of requesting individual tokens per tenant introduces unacceptable security vulnerabilities. The team is balancing short-term delivery pressure against the known obsolescence of current work within weeks.

The semantic data endpoints face scaling limitations as other teams like workbooks begin building production features on our proof-of-concept infrastructure. While Rowan Bailey successfully redirected them toward proper GTM store integration for production, this pattern reveals a broader challenge of teams discovering and depending on our experimental endpoints without understanding their limitations.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The environment incongruity issues uncovered by Matt and Danny reveal a systemic problem in how ZoomInfo\'s services authenticate across development, staging, and production environments. The fact that network ACLs are the primary security mechanism rather than proper service mesh authentication creates brittleness that impacts velocity across multiple teams. This suggests an opportunity for a unified authentication service that abstracts environment-specific complexity.

The rapid adoption of semantic data capabilities by the workbooks team validates our hypothesis that intelligence-driven features represent a significant differentiator. Jagan\'s team immediately recognized the value of \"build me a workbook of accounts I\'ve discussed pricing with\" as a demo flow, confirming that natural language intelligence queries will drive next-generation go-to-market workflows. This positions semantic data as a platform capability rather than a feature.

Rowan\'s observation about entity resolution needs in LLM-generated roll-ups highlights a meta-insight: as we scale AI-assisted reporting across the organization, we\'re creating duplicate entities and redundant information that degrades signal quality. This presents an opportunity to apply our semantic intelligence capabilities to our own operational data, potentially creating a feedback loop that improves organizational intelligence.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our integration with the GTM store team remains critical for September deliverables, with 30 tenants currently processed and alignment needed on ingestion priorities. Danny Pan is coordinating schema delivery to Linda\'s team this week, establishing the foundation for transitioning away from direct Chorus API access to centralized data infrastructure.

The workbooks team\'s dependency on semantic data search capabilities requires careful coordination to prevent them from building production features on non-scalable infrastructure. While our endpoints provide valuable proof-of-concept validation, Sam Darcy\'s approach of wrapping BigQuery and ZDP access through the Agentic platform represents the proper architectural pattern for production scaling.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s abbreviated schedule due to Labor Day will focus on completing the GTM store schema handoff and beginning ETL pipeline automation with John Seller\'s return providing critical expertise.

Matt Kowalczyk will lead the productionization of our data ingestion pipeline, transforming the current manual process into an automated system capable of continuous customer data fetching. This work directly enables the scale requirements for Q4, where we expect to onboard significantly more tenants as GTM Studio rolls out broadly. Inga will execute the 1000-thread iteration evaluation over the weekend, providing critical cost and performance benchmarks that will inform our infrastructure scaling decisions.

The team\'s momentum positions us to deliver transformative intelligence capabilities that reduce time-to-insight from days to minutes while establishing semantic data as a foundational platform service across ZoomInfo\'s product portfolio.

**Context Engineering Team Weekly Report - Week of 08/25-08/29**

## **Executive Summary**

This week, the Context Engineering team achieved breakthrough results in AI/ML, with Top Contacts delivering a \~50--64% relative lift over selecting only the buying group. Preparation for Agent Force / Dreamforce launches in mid-October revealed dependencies requiring immediate resource alignment. The team needs architectural decisions on namespace structure for GoToMarket Store integration to maintain September GA timeline for four key signals.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Robyn Sablosky\'s hybrid AI approach using Claude and ChatGPT delivered consistent performance across all industry verticals in lookalikes V1, solving the tech/pharma limitation that plagued V0. This breakthrough enables platform-wide scaling to ReachOut, which represents the largest volume of top contacts usage, potentially impacting thousands of customer interactions weekly.

Christine Sugimoto successfully navigated surprise requirements for Agent Force and Workbooks support, securing clear timelines and expectations despite the unplanned work. Her rapid response prevented potential delays to the mid-October launch window while maintaining progress on critical data quality initiatives.

Srivatsa Marthi resolved upstream data issues blocking the website\'s Buyer ID signal, ensuring delivery of the number one requested feature for September GA. His coordination across teams to fix data pipeline problems demonstrates the technical leadership needed to meet aggressive timelines communicated to executive leadership.

### **Goals & Progress**

**AI/ML Recommendation Scoring**: Top Contacts performance sustained strong momentum, with relative lift climbing from 53% to 64% compared to just selecting the buying group. Velocity experiments validate readiness for platform-wide rollout. The Lookalike POC advanced from an early V0, which showed strength in Tech and Pharma but weaker performance across other verticals, to V1, which demonstrates more consistent multi-industry robustness---key to scalability.

**Signal Architecture Migration**: The transition from tenant-level to user-level buying groups is 90% complete, with final GSO implementation scheduled for Monday. Srivatsa\'s focused effort ensures the September GA commitment for website signals in workbooks remains on track despite discovering the need for fundamental architectural changes in namespace structure.

**Context Layer Foundation**: Rowan Bailey\'s deep dive into context-as-a-service revealed potential issues in the account and person brief pipeline requiring attention. The team is working on a comprehensive roadmap linking data layer improvements to GTM config changes, all aligned to the Dreamforce launch timeline.

### **Strategic Challenges**

The GoToMarket Store team\'s requirement for one namespace per signal type fundamentally changes our integration approach, creating non-trivial overhead for each new signal deployment. Srivatsa identified this will impact scalability unless we develop more efficient namespace creation processes, potentially affecting our ability to rapidly iterate on new signals.

Unaccounted dependencies for Agent Force and Workbooks consumed significant bandwidth from Christine\'s planned data audit work. While timelines are now clear, the team lacks sufficient resources to maintain both strategic initiatives and tactical support requirements, risking quality compromises in the October deliverables.

Marketing OS sellers\' lack of awareness about available demo insights indicates a knowledge transfer gap that could impact sales effectiveness. Christine\'s discovery that sellers don\'t know about existing form complete signals suggests broader enablement issues requiring systematic documentation and training beyond current capacity.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The namespace architecture feedback from GoToMarket Store fundamentally challenges our unified schema approach, revealing that downstream systems require signal-specific schemas for optimal performance. This architectural constraint creates an opportunity to rationalize our signal portfolio using Marie Kondo principles - keeping only signals that \"spark joy\" in terms of value delivery versus maintenance cost.

Robyn is preparing a proposal (to be shared Thursday) outlining a hybrid strategy for account coverage. ChatGPT will be used for the top 10K US companies, where it outperforms Claude and delivers lower token costs. For the longtail of SMB companies, we will build a dedicated model optimized for scale and efficiency. Robyn will meet with Brannen to develop a strategy for calculating how the model\'s cost and increased usage translate into higher revenue through greater credit consumption.

The convergence of packaging challenges across DAS (Brandon Tucker\'s feedback), MCP tools structure, and namespace requirements points to a systemic issue: we\'ve been organizing signals by technical type rather than customer use case. This realization opens the path to more intuitive packaging that aligns with how customers actually consume our capabilities.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the GoToMarket Store team on namespace architecture requires immediate alignment on schema standards and creation processes. Without establishing efficient patterns for namespace generation, each new signal will incur significant deployment overhead, potentially blocking our ability to meet the aggressive signal roadmap for Q4.

The surprise Agent Force and Workbooks requirements highlight critical gaps in cross-functional planning with the broader Salesforce ecosystem teams. Christine\'s ability to rapidly establish timelines prevented crisis, but the pattern suggests we need better upstream visibility into launch dependencies to protect strategic initiative bandwidth.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on three critical deliverables that will determine our Dreamforce readiness: Robyn\'s lookalikes scaling proposal, Srivatsa\'s MCP tools packaging structure, and Christine\'s return to the account/person brief data audit that directly impacts context layer quality.

The team will finalize the namespace creation patterns for GoToMarket Store, establishing whether we can maintain our current signal velocity or need to strategically deprecate lower-value signals. Srivatsa and Robyn will collaborate on determining which where users would get the best results from raw signals rather than a ML algorithm, with recommendations for Victor and team to review.

**Core Data Weekly Report - Week of 08/25-08/29**

## **Executive Summary**

Rituparna Das pushed 1 million new title classifications into production. Simultaneously, our agent capabilities continue to progress with Heather advancing Contributory Network driven agents and prototyping a Benchmark Agent, while the team collaborates with cross-team stakeholders to finalize the architecture design for CN data to scale up new CN powered use cases for eligible customers. Jody created an Org Chart agent prototype and drove the Data Insights Agent to production for internal users. Peter Overman\'s investigation into orphaned company profiles revealed an extraordinary URL opportunity - 38M websites with extracted company names from legacy crawlers and 61M with URLs potentially identifying more opportunity for new companies, with crawling planned already for immediate sampling.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

Peter\'s systematic investigation delivered actionable results with 99 million total URLs identified: 38 million where legacy crawlers already extracted company names and 61 million awaiting processing. With crawling tickets ZD-61832 and AD-61835 deployed and analysis ticket DEN-4045 scheduled for next week to assess match rates and yield estimates, even a conservative 1% success rate would deliver nearly one million net new companies for Cam\'s Q4 coverage targets.

The agent ecosystem achieved multiple breakthroughs across the team. Jody drove the Data Insights Agent to production for internal traceability API access while prototyping the Org Chart agent with BigQuery connectivity. Heather advanced Contributory Network driven agents and developed a Benchmark Agent prototype. Meanwhile, Cam confirmed that Snowflake integration and scheduling capabilities will arrive within two weeks, positioning the team to leverage these new tools.

Rituparna\'s title classification deployment marks a major data quality milestone, with the new database architecture processing 1 million classifications while the team initiated weekend reprocessing for associated contact IDs. The upcoming 5TB HEM-MAID migration from Snowflake to BigQuery will identify common entities between our two largest data sources, potentially unlocking millions more classified roles pending FinOps cost approval.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Data Asset Expansion**: Peter completed the first draft schema for Xverum LinkedIn company profiles with historical employee count samples received for review, finalized H2 Data Pipelines roadmap materials for Friday\'s session with leadership, and completed parking domain analysis with research.

**Agent Development:** Reviewed and documented the available paths for agent availability. Data team will follow-up with a working session with the agent team to ensure proper understanding of established architectural paradigms to help improve velocity. The team is collaborating with cross-team stakeholders to finalize the architecture design for CN data, with the goal to scale up new CN powered use cases for the right eligible customers fast. Heather\'s work on Contributory Network base ZI Chat agent addresses growing questions about data ingestion status, while the upcoming chat agent will provide self-service answers previously requiring PM intervention.

**Platform Modernization**: Cam achieved 50% progress documenting Company 2.0 functionality despite zero existing DAP platform documentation, requiring exhaustive knowledge transfer with Anatoly\'s team. Magnus secured engineering manager and architect for shared services with concrete demand from IBM, ServiceNow, and Workday, though individual contributors remain unassigned and Michael Governale\'s unexpected absence impacts timelines.

### **Strategic Challenges**

Legal\'s two-week negotiation standoff with Heather over AI data usage permissions blocks the entire data sharing page revamp and downstream agent deployment. Legal insists on narrow, case-specific permissions while our competitive position requires broader umbrella coverage for rapid iteration. Heather\'s escalation document to Brandon and Dominic seeks executive intervention as Salesforce\'s mid-September flag delivery approaches.

Resource constraints create cascading delays across initiatives. Hayden sits at 25% progress on transparency API metrics Brandon expects completed, blocked by Sam\'s unavailability and the Analysis team losing permanent headcount. Will explore alternatives like using Ivan\'s context generation model and Jody\'s LLM-based git repo analysis.

The Company 2.0 documentation crisis threatens M8 launch timing and our ability to capitalize on Peter\'s URL discovery. Cam reports extreme difficulty securing time with Anatoly\'s team, with every feature requiring human explanation of undocumented functionality. Without clear go/no-go criteria for feature continuity, we risk either delaying launch or breaking critical customer workflows.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Peter\'s observation that we lack forensic capabilities for AI failures represents a strategic blind spot beyond debugging. His proposed sub-agent to log conversation metrics would reveal fill rates by query type, identify critical metadata gaps, and map failure patterns to customer segments. Without this observability, we\'re optimizing blind while competitors could leapfrog us by better understanding their performance gaps.

The agent platform\'s evolution revealed unexpected monetization complexity requiring fundamental business model rethinking. John\'s analysis of Global\'s technographics exposed our lack of systematic coverage understanding - we\'ve accumulated features organically over time without clear segmentation of which customer demographics we serve well versus poorly. This prevents strategic data acquisition and leaves us vulnerable to competitors who can target our weakest segments with precision.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Rachel\'s involvement analyzing address normalization across PII, Company, and web data acquisition establishes a new collaboration model for identifying best practices rather than duplicating efforts. Her findings determine whether PII\'s existing API becomes the foundation or requires ground-up development, directly impacting Magnus\'s 60-day Company 3.0 support timeline.

The chat bot team\'s roadmap directly enables our agent strategy, with scheduling capabilities and Snowflake integration arriving within two weeks per Cam\'s morning discussion. Initial user-permission-based database access provides immediate value while service roles develop, though this creates security considerations for customer-facing deployments.

The internal Salesforce team\'s mid-September account-level AI flag remains a hard dependency for Heather\'s data sharing initiatives after two months of delays.

## **Looking Ahead**

Peter will execute the phased URL analysis plan: analyzing 100K samples of each cohort to measure match rates and projected yield (net new company profiles, existing company attribute additions). In parallel, Peter will review the parked domain analysis with relevant teams to decide treatment for the \~5MM estimated company profiles with inactive websites.

Agent development accelerates with Jody cataloging all initiatives to prevent duplication while building shared services agent prototypes. The imminent Snowflake integration enables automated daily reports like \"trending companies\" or \"coverage gap analysis\" - transforming multi-week engineering projects into morning Slack messages. Heather\'s Contributory Network and Benchmark agents will demonstrate customer value while building the case for dedicated agent resources.

Critical decisions require resolution: Cam needs Company 2.0 feature continuity framework finalized, Heather requires legal breakthrough for agent deployment. Combined with Peter\'s URL recovery projections and Rituparna\'s HEM-MAID migration timeline, these decisions determine whether we achieve aggressive Q4 targets or require immediate expectation management with market and leadership.

**Product Operations Weekly Report - August 25, 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

The team made continued progress on automating the flow of information from product to our GTM teams and customers: Ken Elwell delivered account-specific agents including the vertical datasets/ELA 7x7 reporting tool for Laser and AM deck creation capabilities (though adoption challenges need further exploration), Kristin Gandini streamlined MCR processes with improved transparency and simplified requirements, and Daniel Kong automated implementation guide updates while piloting AI-first personalized guides with Andres Perez. Separately, Sam Darcy achieved significant VOC improvements by leveraging the Agentic platform and new GTM store API, enabling immediate deployment for PM testing.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Agent Development Progress**: Ken Elwell completed multiple agent initiatives including the vertical datasets/ELA 7x7 reporting tool that successfully tracks 41 customer engagements from the past week with drill-down capabilities into specific conversations. The AM deck creation agents are functional, though adoption remains limited due to information overload - Henry\'s company-wide email generated only 30-40 additional uses before plateauing, highlighting the need to reduce noise and integrate into existing workflows.

**VOC Platform Enhancement**: Sam Darcy leveraged the Semantic team\'s Agentic platform and new GTM store API to create major improvements in VOC capabilities. By deploying an agent that utilizes existing sub-agents for re-ranking and relevance filtering, we now have full API access to transcripts without BigQuery dependencies, with deployment to GCP playground targeted for immediate completion.

**Implementation Guide Automation**: Daniel Kong successfully automated implementation guide updates with PMs now using AI agents to handle the refresh process. He\'s advancing to pilot AI-first personalized implementation guides with Andres Perez, creating account-specific setup instructions rather than forcing customers to navigate 20-page PDFs with multiple configuration paths.

### **Goals & Progress**

**MCR Process Maturation**: Kristin Gandini delivered significant MCR improvements including better transparency on late additions, clarified requirements and deadlines, and streamlined documentation needs. The team simplified requirements by making demo videos mandatory but how-to guides optional, and replaced complex GIF workflows with simple screenshot requests in release notes.

**Product Information Knowledge Base**: Kristin confirmed Russell\'s team isn\'t duplicating our product knowledge base efforts, but progress was limited due to urgent MCR demands. The critical need for systematic product information management (distinct from our product marketing engine) remains unaddressed, with Brett acknowledging this strategic initiative keeps getting displaced by tactical fires.

**Sales Enablement Integration**: Ken\'s agents for personalized release notes and roadmaps are technically complete but face adoption friction. The core challenge isn\'t the tools themselves but the overwhelming amount of content and links being sent to reps - Brett noted that until these become menu-based options within existing workflows, sustained adoption will remain elusive regardless of communication frequency.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Information Overload vs. Workflow Integration**: Despite strong tools, the team identified that sending 25 different links creates noise rather than value. Ken highlighted the disconnect that enablement needs 1-2 weeks to plan rollout for a tool built in one week, while Brett emphasized that reps preparing for meetings won\'t add extra steps unless tools are seamlessly integrated into their existing workflow.

**Product Knowledge Base Delays**: The distinction between product information knowledge (technical documentation, feature specs) and product marketing knowledge (positioning, messaging) has become critical. While we\'ve made progress on marketing content through GTM Studio frameworks, the technical knowledge base keeps getting deprioritized despite being foundational for both internal teams and customer success.

**Coverage During Transitions**: With Ken out next week and September MCR materials due Tuesday, the team faces coverage challenges for critical tools like the roadmap agent. Brett acknowledged struggling to protect strategic work from the \"million little things\" that emerge from being in the release process firing line.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Platform Leverage Accelerates Delivery**: Sam\'s success with the Agentic platform validates our strategy of building on existing infrastructure rather than creating isolated solutions. By integrating with the Semantic team\'s platform and leveraging the new GTM store API, we inherited months of optimization work while maintaining control over our specific requirements.

**Simplification Drives Compliance**: The team\'s systematic simplification of requirements - from GIFs to screenshots, from mandatory to optional how-to guides - reflects a crucial insight: perfect documentation that doesn\'t get created has less value than good documentation that ships consistently. Every additional step reduces completion rates exponentially.

**Two Knowledge Systems Serve Different Needs**: The clear delineation between product information knowledge (how features work, technical specs, configuration details) and product marketing knowledge (positioning, messaging, competitive differentiation) requires separate approaches. Daniel\'s work on personalized implementation guides addresses the former, while the GTM Studio frameworks serve the latter.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Mary\'s CX team continues highlighting critical gaps, particularly around identifying which customers are impacted by specific releases. Kristin\'s exploration of LaunchDarkly integration offers a systematic solution, but requires careful coordination to balance automation with necessary human oversight.

The Semantic data team partnership proved transformative for VOC development, though operational realities like Sam waiting as the 32nd PR in their queue demonstrate the challenges of shared infrastructure. Their platform provided essential capabilities we couldn\'t build independently within reasonable timeframes.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week demands disciplined focus on strategic initiatives while managing September MCR requirements and coverage gaps during Ken\'s absence.

**Immediate Priorities**: Sam will complete VOC front-end integration and deploy for PM testing, validating months of platform development. Daniel continues piloting AI-first personalized implementation guides with Andres, creating a model for scalable technical documentation. Kristin and Brett will cover critical agent support while advancing the product information knowledge base despite competing demands.

**Strategic Imperative**: Brett committed to defining and protecting the 3-4 initiatives that truly move the needle, explicitly prioritizing the product information knowledge base over urgent but less important tasks. The team recognizes that without this discipline, tactical work will continue overwhelming strategic progress. Success means both delivering September release materials and making measurable progress on foundational infrastructure that compounds value over time.

**Automation Weekly Report - 8/29/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Architectural insights reshape integration strategies while API dependency challenges emerge across platform initiatives. Marc Frail discovered that Copilot Pro functions as a data view rather than a database, fundamentally changing the Workbook integration approach from data transfer workflows to data source exposure patterns. Sam Massie completed action library discovery requirements but identified that unpublished Workbooks APIs could block workflow integration progress. Meanwhile, the website trigger strategy pivoted toward centralized GTM Store integration, demonstrating platform evolution but creating new cross-team dependencies.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**Marc Frail achieved architectural clarity on Copilot Pro integration**, discovering that Copilot Pro serves as a view layer on existing data sources rather than a standalone database. This insight eliminated the complex workflow-based data transfer approach originally envisioned, revealing that the correct integration pattern exposes worksheets as queryable data sources for view creation - a much simpler and more sustainable approach.

**Sam Massie delivered action library discovery framework**, completing 100% of requirements clarification and handing off design options for connector and action discovery experiences. The work establishes search and browsing capabilities that form a core pillar of extensible automations alongside data mapping and form builder functionality.

**Website trigger architecture evolved toward platform integration**, coordinating a strategic pivot from direct website triggers to GTM Store-based event emission. This approach aligns with the integration team\'s partner framework vision while creating more scalable patterns for external data ingestion.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Action Library Discovery**: Sam Massie completed 100% of connector and action discovery requirements, providing design teams with clear direction for search and browsing experiences that will enable users to find and configure automation capabilities across the expanding platform ecosystem.

**Integration Architecture Definition**: Marc Frail completed 100% of Route documentation and Copilot Pro integration analysis, discovering fundamental architectural insights that simplified previously complex integration scenarios while establishing clearer patterns for cross-system workflows.

**Platform Evolution Recognition**: Both team members identified the shift toward true platform thinking, with Sam Massie noting \"we\'re finally starting to work like a platform\" as individual teams take ownership of their contributions to the broader automation ecosystem.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Workbooks API availability threatens integration timeline**, with Sam Massie discovering that required create and update APIs haven\'t been published internally yet. This dependency could block the Workbook-Workflow integration that represents a core component of the GTM Studio activation strategy.

**API-first adoption remains inconsistent across teams**, creating integration complexity as Marc Frail\'s investigation revealed varying levels of API maturity across ZoomInfo applications. The automation team\'s success depends on other teams embracing contributory approaches to the action ecosystem.

**Cross-team coordination complexity increases with platform evolution**, as the website trigger pivot demonstrates both the benefits and challenges of centralized architecture decisions. While the approach creates better long-term patterns, it requires careful coordination with multiple stakeholders including Andres and the integrations team.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Copilot Pro architectural understanding transforms integration approach**, with Marc Frail\'s discovery that it functions as a view layer rather than a database eliminating complex data transfer workflows in favor of simple data source exposure. This insight prevents significant over-engineering while enabling more flexible integration patterns.

**Platform thinking requires contributor mindset shifts**, as both team members recognized that automation success depends on individual teams building with integration in mind. Marc Frail noted that \"the contributory network to Workflow actions is really owned by everyone,\" requiring cultural change beyond technical implementation.

**Website trigger centralization validates platform strategy**, with the pivot to GTM Store integration demonstrating how centralized event emission creates more scalable patterns for both internal teams and external partners. The approach abstracts complexity while enabling broader ecosystem participation.

**Action development will accelerate after initial examples**, with both team members recognizing that early implementations will serve as templates and forcing functions for API-first thinking. Sam Massie noted that \"once we do the first couple of these, it\'ll be easier\" as patterns become established.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Workbooks team coordination is essential for API publication, with Sam Massie requiring access to create and update endpoints before workflow integration can proceed. This dependency affects core GTM Studio activation timeline.

Integrations team collaboration through Andres is critical for website trigger event definition and GTM Store integration, requiring careful alignment on event schemas and emission patterns.

## **Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on resolving API dependencies while advancing field mapping toward engineering handoff and establishing GTM CDC integration patterns.

Sam Massie will check in with the Workbooks team on API publication timeline, finalize requirements for the new match step functionality, and potentially hand off field mapping to engineering for development initiation. Marc Frail will define implementation plans for exposing GTM CDC events as workflow triggers, enabling powerful automation scenarios around account owner changes and custom field updates.

The convergence of architectural clarity, platform thinking adoption, and API dependency resolution creates potential for significant automation capability expansion, but success requires careful coordination of cross-team dependencies and continued advocacy for API-first development practices across ZoomInfo\'s application portfolio.

**User-Provisioning Team Weekly Report - 8/25/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

This week, the User-Provisioning team made significant progress on the solution for estimating, charging, and tracking AI Action Credits. A major win was the decision to consolidate the AI Pricebook and AI Credit Service into a single, centralized service, which does add scope, but simplifies the design for reporting. Meeting the October 1st deadline with the evolving requirements is aggressive, but the additional time on design is important to get this right. Additionally, Josh Simon completed the initial requirements for the new Audit Service, which is a foundational step toward improving customer trust and security and sunsetting the current LoginAs solution.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

A key achievement was the decision to merge the AI Pricebook and AI Credit Service into a single, unified service. This consolidation allows for tracking effort at a job level, which is essential for accurate reporting. While the churn in requirements shortens our development and testing timeline for October 1st, there has been a lot of focus recently on how companies have done this poorly (e.g. Cursor), that investing additional time on the design is necessary.

Josh Simon made progress on the Audit Service by drafting the requirements for what fields and actions to track. Finalized the requirements will be included in his product review document.

### **Goals & Progress**

**AI Action Credit Management:** Brannen Huske and Jessie Lindstrom\'s goal was to finalize the requirements, with a specific focus on reporting. They both reported 90% completion, with the final 10% dependent on a design review with the Workbook team. This review is critical to final sign off since the Workbooks team will be the first to use this new credit charging system.

**Audit Service:** Josh Simon completed his goal of drafting the requirements for the new Audit Service. The service is intended to establish customer trust and lay the groundwork for removing the \"LoginAs\" feature.

### **Strategic Challenges**

A significant strategic challenge is the timeline for the AI charging mechanism. With a hard deadline of October 1st, there is no buffer. This makes the upcoming weeks an \"all-hands-on-deck\" effort for the team.

A second challenge is the ongoing difficulty in testing the HTTP-only cookie solution for login bounce issues. The team has been unable to connect with customers, even after reaching out to new contacts at HubSpot. This has become a blocker for being able to validate the solution, the team anticipates customers will be more available after month end.

## **Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

One key learning this week, shared by both Jessie Lindstrom and Brannen Huske, was the value of consolidating the AI pricebook and credit service into a single, centralized service. This change was a result of a final review with the Agentic team and allows for tracking effort at a more granular \"job level\". This centralized approach enables the various reporting views needed to adjust pricing and optimize effort.

A significant insight from Josh Simon\'s LoginAs discovery is the heavy reliance of internal teams on the feature for their day-to-day work. Removing it will require retraining these teams to use other tools. A potential solution discussed with Ali Sadat is to create a \"customer login sharing capability\" similar to what Salesforce offers, which would allow admins and users to share access with each other and with ZoomInfo support. This would also serve as an interim testing ground for a future solution that could replace LoginAs for some departments.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

The User-Provisioning team is highly dependent on the Workbook and Agentic teams to finalize the AI Action Credit management design and ensure the system can correctly charge for AI actions. A final review with the Workbooks team is scheduled for Tuesday to get this locked down. The team is also waiting to connect with customers to validate the HTTP-only cookie solution for login issues, which has been difficult due to end-of-month sales pushes.

## **Looking Ahead**

The primary focus for next week will be the final sign off of the AI Action Credit management design. Brannen Huske will represent the provisioning team during the final review with the Agentic and Workbook teams to ensure all use cases for the new centralized charging service are accounted for and a clear implementation path is established. The team will also continue efforts to connect with customers to validate the cookie solution, with Tony and Sagar taking the lead on this while Josh Simon is out. This work is critical to delivering on key initiatives for security, monetization, and customer experience.

**Business Intelligence Team Weekly Report - Week of 8/25/2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Bottom Line: Despite most team members being out this week, we achieved a major strategic breakthrough---Nanxi\'s retention analysis uncovered counterintuitive customer behavior that challenges core assumptions about contract lifecycle engagement. Usage actually increases toward contract end for both renewal and churn groups, with renewers showing significantly higher adoption spikes than churners. This finding could fundamentally reshape our renewal strategy timing. Additionally, Eran delivered strong progress on his partial week back from PTO, identifying March Networks as our ideal GTM case study with quantified 8-day annual savings, while Ferrell advanced integration tracking despite reduced team capacity.

## **This Week\'s Progress**
