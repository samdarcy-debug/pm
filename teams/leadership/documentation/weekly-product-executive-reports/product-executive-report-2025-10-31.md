| **Chat Accuracy, Performance & Cost Issues Threatening Post-Launch Adoption** | **SalesOS/Copilot Team:** Sean Walter expresses 60% confidence in November 3rd sales readiness due to chat accuracy concerns and latency issues. 60-70% of internal users double-check chat responses in Salesforce because the AI frequently surfaces wrong accounts or opportunities based on role hierarchy. Adam Severance noted that chat-to-views base functionality is live in staging but not good enough, with most issues stemming from the prompt itself and the LLM not understanding how to navigate right use cases, requiring significant time from the product team to improve the orchestrator layer\'s understanding.                                                                                                                                 |

Performance is lagging user expectations, directly related to the cost issues through extra LLM calls and inefficient context handling. Semantic data coverage is incomplete - users expect to chat about any engagement visible in Chorus, but the current approach only uses semantic data, creating frustration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Danny identified that the team can execute 90-day retention within budget, but 365-day for the expanded tenant scope significantly exceeds this threshold, carrying substantial cost implications that need executive-level decision-making.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **GTM Data Model Coordination Complexity & Architectural Confusion**          | **Core Data Team:** John Durst escalated that no architectural review had occurred with the data engineering team two months from launch. The discovery that data teams must push to GTM Store rather than allowing consumption from sources represents a fundamental architecture change requiring entire service builds without allocated resources. The December 31 GTM Store deadline is \"not as hard\" as originally believed, providing a runway to \"do it right\" with proper architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The team needs a consolidated list of demands from the GTM data model across all team members, since GTM data model is central to success of most initiatives. David Goulden raised concerns that GTM Config work tends to design for net new customers but many existing customers won\'t go through full setup---they\'ve already half-configured the system---so the offering setup flow designed as if starting new won\'t work well for the installed base.                                                                                                                 |

This creates uncertainty around whether to build on GraphQL infrastructure or continue optimizing direct data access patterns, with cost and maintainability implications for multiple ongoing initiatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Front-End & Engineering Resource Constraints Across Multiple Teams**        | **GTM Studio Team:** Front-end resource allocation from Denis\' team remains the primary execution dependency for M3 GTM Studio version. While Denis\' team assigned front-end resources for Data Health Scan, final confirmation is still needed to ensure no execution gaps as development ramps up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

This maintenance burden is compounded by the agentic team supporting multiple product surfaces simultaneously, with Ryan Stevens and Josh White being pulled across workbooks, workspace, and other initiatives. Derek Osgood\'s plays initiative depends on front-end React resources that are scarce company-wide, creating a constraint on the next wave of features.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The single data science resource supporting company initiatives was pulled to board of directors work, forcing both industry model and employee growth model delays to Q1 2026. Shared services dependencies intensified after alignment with AI Data Management; the part-time resource model of Shared Services is insufficient when shared services could block studio releases due to an inability to hit deadlines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Semantic Data Infrastructure & Coverage Gaps**                              | **Semantic Data Team:** Matt\'s departure next week creates immediate knowledge gaps in batch embeddings implementation. Without batch embeddings, backfills require pausing ongoing runs to prevent conflicts---ongoing runs burst-call for embeddings, and any backfill runs compete for the same token allocation, causing throttling and errors. Cross-functional dependencies with the ZDP team introduce timing risk for the vector store work, with team upheaval disrupting established communication channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Rowan Bailey restructured the Q4 roadmap to address infrastructure demands from Copilot Workspace alongside the original GTM Studio timeline. Three blockers emerged: uncertainty around whether the GraphQL API delay affects MCP Gateway launch in mid-December, lack of semantic data for expected accounts due to conservative cost-control filters that now cause more friction than value, and confusion around admin portal migration paths as products package together in unclear ways.                                                                                                                                                            |

The last two states create user confusion by returning empty cells with no differentiation. Enablement across field, support, and SC teams needs strengthening as many lack clear understanding of what semantic enrichment is.                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Cross-Team Dependencies & Partnership Coordination Complexity**             | **Automation Team:** Salesforce partnership timeline creates resource pressure, with end-of-November target for buildable functionality requiring minimal changes achievable in one sprint. More complex requirements like contact data credit bypassing would need additional engineering resources and represent implementation risk requiring new entitlements and careful security controls. The partnership requires extensive cross-functional coordination, involving legal terms review, potentially new contracting, financial agreement validation, and careful consideration of data misuse liability.

While the gateway won\'t be production-ready until mid-December with tool refactoring extending into January, there\'s a temporary path available through the existing wrapper Zheng created for immediate high-priority needs. Holiday coverage presents resource constraints with significant team time off planned between Christmas and New Year\'s. The definition and scope of \"context service\" requires clarification across stakeholders---what began as tenant and user context retrieval has expanded to potentially include scoring, recommendations, and other API endpoints.                                                         |

The assumption that the Agentic team could easily \"fudge together\" credit usage data proved incorrect because the data storage was not set up for that level of analysis. This reinforces the urgency of pushing all users, starting with internal tenants, onto the official AI credit service as the necessary \"consistent way\" to track usage on a per-user basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Copilot Workspace (Victor)**    | **Intelligence Team:** Lars Vedo\'s team is 95% complete on the November 3rd release, with slides in production, citations working for multiple sources, and the new agent with sub-agents in testing. The team is managing scope carefully after learning that rapid prototyping created maintenance overhead, with emailer requiring a rebuild and several \"quick win\" features from earlier demos now requiring significant polish work. Three critical technical issues require immediate focus: costs are \"crazy high\" with unoptimized context and expensive models, performance is slower than acceptable, and semantic data coverage gaps are creating user frustration. |

### 

### **Update on Previous Week Blockers**

**Semantic enrichment scalability for November 3rd launch:** Semantic enrichment achieved the scalability needed for go-live and is now in production, though data coverage gaps remain (60-70% result rate). The team implemented whitelist-mode ingestion to handle 100K accounts and deployed temporal solutions for batch processing. However, costs remain \"sky high\" and performance is slower than acceptable, requiring immediate post-launch optimization focus.

**Front-end resource constraints across multiple teams:** Front-end resource allocation improved with Denis\' team assigning developers to GTM Studio M3 work, though final confirmation is still needed. The Plays team\'s front-end restyling reached 50% completion heading into launch week. However, resourcing gaps persist, particularly around the Agentic Platform where engineers like Josh and Ryan Stevens are stretched across workbooks, workspace, and backend systems.

### **Current Week Update**

**Blockers:**

- **Chat accuracy and performance threaten Workspace adoption post-launch:** 60-70% of internal users double-check chat responses in Salesforce because the AI frequently surfaces wrong accounts or opportunities based on role hierarchy. Combined with high costs and slow performance, these fundamental UX issues risk undermining the November 3rd launch momentum and require immediate optimization focus.

- **GTM Data Model coordination complexity creating timeline uncertainty:** Multiple teams need consolidated requirements and clearer direction on GTM Config timing, migration paths for existing customers, and how to federate capabilities into search and other services. The December 31st deadline is \"not as hard\" as originally believed, but architectural decisions around data push vs. consumption models weren\'t communicated to data owners, creating unplanned work.

**Momentum areas:**

- **November 3rd launch readiness achieved across GTM Studio and Workspace:** All workstreams converged successfully with field enablement completed, semantic enrichment scaled, Plays functionality in staging, and ROI Analytics validated. Customer cohort workbooks are live, VPs have activated prospecting blocks, and the Studio-to-Workspace integration is already driving organic adoption from sales leaders like Alex Lazer\'s team.

- **Major partnership opportunities emerging with Salesforce and AWS:** Adam Peretz engaged with Salesforce on agentic data access following Ali\'s Dreamforce discussions, potentially enabling Salesforce to sell ZoomInfo access to their customers. Separately, AWS is building custom agent tools and seeking marketplace integration. Both partnerships require careful navigation of technical, legal, and financial considerations but represent significant revenue opportunities.

**Bottom line:** The November 3rd launch is positioned for success with strong field enablement and product stability, but the team must immediately address three critical post-launch priorities: chat accuracy/performance optimization, cost reduction across agentic infrastructure, and GTM Data Model coordination to prevent downstream execution delays. The convergence of major partnerships (Salesforce, AWS) and platform infrastructure maturation (API versioning, data connectors, MCP Gateway) creates significant momentum, but success requires careful management of resource constraints and architectural complexity while maintaining the Q1 Plays timeline discipline.

### **GTM Studio**

**GTM Studio Team:** \"The week before our November 3rd launch proved decisive as all workstreams converged on release readiness. Workbooks completed field enablement sessions covering foundations, competitive positioning, and demo deep dives while finalizing product briefs, demo videos, and new import/enrich modals to showcase our data ecosystem breadth. Plays pushed the initial release to staging with workflow creation flows operational and began finalizing the M1 testing plan, though front-end restyling work stands at 50% complete heading into the final week. ROI Analytics verified GTM Data Store backfilled historical data in the dev environment, with the CFA team planning cutover to the new data store by November 12th---giving three weeks to validate everything ahead of the December 9th GA release---while multi-currency support completed testing in staging and moved toward production deployment. Data Management prioritized the next batch of 10 accounts with account managers for data health scan outreach, completed PRD review for the M3 GTM Studio version, and kicked off development work, though front-end resource allocation from Denis\' team remains the primary execution dependency.\"

### **GTM Copilot Workspace**

**SalesOS/Copilot Team:** \"Sean Walter is refocusing the December roadmap around three core themes following the GTM data model pivot: features that deliver aha moments and help sell the product, platform narrative connections (workbooks/GTM Datastore integration), and validated high-priority user feedback addressing fundamental gaps. The shift toward GTM data model integration represents a significant architectural decision that won\'t disrupt the roadmap substantially---a POC is feasible for December that will enable view creation across different datasets, addressing current limitations around data source joining. Meanwhile, the 2K limit workaround using recommended filters is progressing toward Monday\'s release, though Sean expresses 60% confidence in the November 3rd sales readiness milestone due to chat accuracy concerns and latency issues that continue to erode user trust.\"

**DAI Executive Team:** \"Workspace achieved sales and customer readiness for the November 3rd launch, with significantly improved stability and the Studio-to-Workspace integration already gaining organic traction from sales leaders. Adam completed his November resourcing analysis, identifying gaps particularly around A2A work that needs immediate attention. The biggest concern heading into launch week is that while the product functions, the user experience requires substantial polish---chat frequently pulls wrong data for users\' roles, and view creation needs multiple improvements already slated for mid-November delivery.\"

### **GTM AI Context Service**

**Intelligence Team (Agentic Platform & Copilot Workspace):** \"The team is in the final stages of shipping the November 3rd release for Copilot Workspace with slides, citations, recent Chorus engagements, and view creation via chat. However, three critical issues demand immediate attention: costs are unsustainably high due to unoptimized context and expensive models, performance is slower than acceptable, and semantic data coverage gaps are creating user frustration. Lars Vedo and Ryan Stevens are leading the November 3rd launch while managing technical debt from rapid prototyping, with Carlos Nunez stabilizing the workbooks-semantic data integration that nearly derailed the release timeline. A decision was also made to process all account\'s engagement data using the Semantic service so we can close the gap on missing engagement data next week.\"

**MCP Tiger Team:** \"The MCP Gateway implementation reached 90% completion this week with three critical infrastructure components now operational. Carter completed the control plane APIs with MongoDB persistence and API key management, while Zheng finished the OAuth flow implementation and began request routing development. The team is tracking toward mid-December gateway availability, with a clear path to refactoring existing tools into the new architecture in January. Holiday coverage planning is now documented given significant team time off between Christmas and New Year\'s.\"

**Semantic Data Team:** \"The team addressed immediate technical and resource constraints to enable ZoomInfo tenant scaling. Danny identified that current 365-day retention costs exceed the allocated \$10K monthly budget and developed a whitelist-mode ingestion approach that will enable processing 100K accounts without the 5x time penalty. Jon is on track to complete GTM Store integration within one week, contingent on three uninterrupted mornings. Matt\'s departure creates knowledge transfer gaps in batch embeddings, requiring careful orchestration of backfill runs until Jon completes the handoff.\"

### **Vertical Datasets**

**Data Executive Team (Vertical Datasets Update):** Brandon Tucker documented comprehensive requirements for waterfall enrichment capabilities to match Clay\'s supplemental enrichment features while maintaining quality standards through PTI\'s 50-accuracy score construct. ByteMine data shows exceptional promise with nearly 12 million mobile numbers available for US contacts lacking mobiles, representing significant coverage expansion. The team plans to make this free to customers, positioning it as a competitive differentiator that highlights ZoomInfo\'s commitment to quality data over volume-only approaches, with a December launch target.

Igor Kyrylenko standardized 11 of 20 acquired professional licenses states into unified layouts, accelerating future processing despite challenges from states like Ohio with 11 different data formats. FINRA data reached production-ready status in Snowflake with proper schema and views for investors and firms, advancing toward Wells Fargo productization discussions. The team is collaborating with Sandeep\'s offshore resources to accelerate additional state acquisitions and completed automation tooling for bulk email-based data requests, pending final legal approval before deployment across multiple dataset types.

### **Other Data**

**Data Executive Team:** \"The team successfully positioned a Contributory Network Deal Cycle Analysis agent for board demonstration, with Brandon Wilson completing full pipeline validation and achieving staging deployment. This represents a tangible showcase of how customer data can power actionable insights for sales leaders. Brandon Tucker is driving waterfall enrichment requirements to address competitive gaps with Clay, planning a December launch of free supplemental data enrichment that maintains quality standards while matching competitor features. Meanwhile, Igor Kyrylenko expanded professional licenses coverage to 20 states with 11 fully standardized, positioning FINRA data for productization with Wells Fargo showing early interest.\"

**Core Data Team:** \"Concerns emerged around GTM Store implementation for Core Company and Contact with John Durst escalating that no architectural review had occurred with the data engineering team - the discovery that data teams must push to GTM Store rather than allowing consumption from sources represents a fundamental architecture change requiring entire service builds without allocated resources. Resource allocation tensions intensified as Leadership/board of directors work pulled data science resources from Cam Fortin\'s industry model refinement, but after further discussion was mitigated with some resource allocation likely near end of Q4 and overall industry rollout not likely until April to avoid large territory impact changes for customers. However, Cam discovered the December 31 GTM Store deadline is \'not as hard\' as originally believed, providing a runway to \'do it right\' with proper architecture. Heather Ma completed the benchmark agent production roadmap and initiated technical review cycles, while contributory network infrastructure planning shifted toward establishing business value alignment before pursuing engineering resource discussions.\"

### **Other Platform**

**ZIM Team:** \"Team positions for \$15M annual DSP ad spend goal with \$2.9M remaining across November-December following \$1.5M October achievement and Adobe\'s \$200K single-month campaign commitment. Technology Advice advances pixel deployment becoming first fully onboarded identity partner while Adverity termination completes with DeltaX two-year \$540K contract signed. Applied AI pod structure establishes Q1 2026 team blending with Jenny and Troy joining Kate, Tamiro, and Harry Z for identification and ZIM model expansion.\"

**Automation Team:** \"Partnership opportunities with Salesforce and AWS emerge while the data connector library exceeds targets and API versioning framework nears leadership review. Adam Peretz completed API versioning proposal and identified pathways for MCP credit estimation, while navigating complex partnership discussions with Salesforce around agentic data access and AWS around marketplace integration. Marc Frail exceeded data connector goals, building 22 connectors versus the target of 8, though publishing flow requires MVE and UNIE integration rationalization. The Salesforce partnership presents both significant revenue opportunity and substantial technical and legal complexity requiring executive attention.\"

**Integrations Team:** \"Prateek Paikray successfully released the new Agentforce managed package with entitlement tracking and completed Data Catalog UI integration with the Global Dataset API, while organic customer interest from Flex.com, Uber for Business, and FedEx validates market demand for the ZI Revenue Agent. Sanyog Rai\'s systematic validation of engagements use cases is identifying GraphQL and GTM Store issues before they impact downstream teams, creating a quality gate that ensures platform reliability. Erica Fienman\'s roadmap continued to execute with CRM importing every one hour for all GTM DM tenants, and GTM DM backfill at 100% complete. Andres Perez built foundational Auth-MS infrastructure within the Agentic Platform that unblocks future vendor tool development and enables the Auto-Custom-Field Agent to access user tokens and CRM configurations.\"

**Team Provisioning & Login:** \"The team has successfully achieved full alignment on the AI credit rollout for GTM Studio Early Access (EA) customers and is executing the plan to cut over internal tenants to the AI credit service. Jessie Kain Lindstrom secured sign-off on the narrative, customer materials, and the allocation of 25,000 AI credits for remaining month for GTM Studio EA customers. Brannen Huske, working with relevant teams, has a cutover plan for November 3rd to ensure internal usage of AI credits is tracked for accurate forecasting and usage data. The main strategic challenge is the urgent need to transition to the live AI credit service to gather actual usage data, as current estimates and modeling are proving insufficient for accurate planning.\"

### **Other Operations**

**Product BI Team:** \"The team achieved a critical milestone this week by launching the first AI-powered self-service analytics agent in the ZIM Slack channel, enabling stakeholders to get instant answers to common questions without BI team intervention. This represents meaningful progress toward scaling our support model. Simultaneously, the Workspace analytics foundation strengthened significantly with the completion of a storytelling-driven adoption dashboard ready for PM self-service ahead of the November 3rd external rollout, while the account health reporting framework advanced through cross-functional alignment on use-case-driven measurement. Next week focuses on expanding Workspace engagement visibility through chatbot integration while the API dashboard work resumes as engineering completes data backfill.\"

**Product Operations Team:** \"Brett Jacobs identified a flaw in how the company has approached release automation: downstream teams are still manually summarizing AI-generated content the same way they did before, just faster. The feature info packs contain rich information and use AI, but enablement, customer success, and field teams take that output and summarize it again for their audiences - building \'a better typewriter instead of a computer\' as Brett described it. This realization came as Kristin Gandini and Sam Darcy brought both the VOC tool and Agent Builder to launch-ready state, and Ken Elwell moved the workspace changelog to near-final status. The team now has clarity on priorities through Brett\'s focus document, with VOC rollout and knowledge management taking center stage while mid-tier initiatives move to maintenance mode.\"

### **Individual Team Reports**

## **DAI Executive Team Weekly Report - October 27-31, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Workspace achieved sales and customer readiness for the November 3rd launch, with significantly improved stability and the Studio-to-Workspace integration already gaining organic traction from sales leaders. Adam completed his November resourcing analysis, identifying gaps particularly around A2A work that needs immediate attention. The biggest concern heading into launch week is that while the product functions, the user experience requires substantial polish---chat frequently pulls wrong data for users\' roles, and view creation needs multiple improvements already slated for mid-November delivery.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Victor confirmed Workspace stability has dramatically improved over the past month, with views loading reliably and chat context reinforced to build user trust. The workbook-to-workspace integration shipped as a bare-bones V1 but is already seeing organic adoption from target users, with Alex Lazer\'s team planning to use it for prospecting starting Monday and Breyers requesting it for a top-account gift campaign.

Sneh\'s team completed field enablement sessions this week covering GTM Studio foundations, competitive positioning, and demo deep dives. The platform narrative is resonating strongly with sellers---so much so that reps are already framing workspace activation as \"plays\" without prompting, revealing both the power of the vision and the pressure to deliver true play orchestration capabilities sooner.

Adam\'s resourcing review exposed critical gaps in November work assignments, particularly around A2A development which has been delayed at least a week. Lars highlighted that quality is suffering from rapid iteration shortcuts that now require cleanup, with costs running sky-high and performance comparatively slow---three big issues that need immediate focus alongside resolving semantic data coverage.

**Goals & Progress**

**November 3rd Launch Readiness:** Workspace meets the bar for sales and customer demos on Monday, though significant UX improvements are already identified and prioritized. Chat user experience needs deep work---60-70% of internal users still double-check responses in Salesforce because chat pulls wrong accounts or opportunities for their role. View improvements around the 2,000 row limit, field discoverability, and manual row addition are either shipping Monday or targeted for mid-November.

**Studio Launch Preparation:** Sneh\'s team has GTM Studio workbooks ready analyzing customer cohorts for use case fit, with each VP receiving workbooks to activate with their reps during a dedicated Monday prospecting block. This puts the product demo directly into action from strategy to execution. Semantic enrichment achieved good scaling progress but uncovered data coverage and quality concerns, while enablement across field, support, and SCs remains weak---teams lack understanding of what semantic is and how it differentiates.

**Platform Infrastructure:** Marc\'s team is green on all November 3rd deliverables except websites (slight slip, resolution expected). The big initiative kicking off is GTM Data Model field value normalization, which will dramatically simplify querying across multiple CRM integrations by providing standardized values for fields like opportunity stage. Brandon\'s team finalized data requirements for waterfall enrichment and will leverage Solr/Bigtable, with new mobile vendor Bytemine expected to add approximately 11M mobiles to US contacts.

**Strategic Challenges**

Chat accuracy and performance issues present the most immediate risk to user adoption post-launch. Internal testing revealed users consistently double-check chat responses against Salesforce because the AI frequently surfaces wrong accounts or opportunities based on role hierarchy. Lars identified this alongside two other major issues: costs are \"sky high\" requiring serious optimization focus, and performance is comparatively slow with significant room for improvement. Resolving semantic data coverage is also critical---either increase Symantec\'s coverage or lean harder into direct Chorus fetching.

The bare-bones state of workspace activation creates adoption risk even as it validates the core value proposition. While the Studio-to-Workspace integration works and drives organic usage, the experience needs rapid iteration to maintain seller confidence. Victor and Sneh agree workspace puts even more pressure on delivering true Plays capabilities---sellers naturally talk about push-to-sales as Plays, but view publishing isn\'t the right product for that. They need tasks and to-dos, which means balancing quick wins on workspace with the actual Plays build for end of Q1.

Resourcing gaps threaten November execution, particularly around the Agentic platform where key engineers like Josh are stretched thin across workbooks and workspace. Adam\'s analysis revealed many November roadmap items assigned at high levels (like to \"Carlos\") without granular resource allocation, creating uncertainty about who\'s actually doing what when. Lars noted quality suffering from engineers getting pulled into different fires, highlighting the need for more dedicated resourcing against critical workstreams.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The platform narrative addresses a critical pain point that\'s driving seat compression conversations. Sneh\'s analysis of semantic data revealed strong validation for the centralized list builder use case---sales managers pulling lists on behalf of sellers rather than having individual reps handle prospecting. This directly counters the common downsell pressure where customers say they don\'t need 30 sales seats, just 5 licenses for team leads. The answer is now clear: Studio for your operator doing centralized list building, Workspace for those 30 sellers to drive deals forward beyond research and prospecting.

Early workspace usage patterns reveal the product has value but it\'s hidden behind user effort. Victor emphasized that without surfacing value immediately on load with one-click access, the rollout will fall flat. Internal users understand the theoretical value of unifying multiple tools, but need to experience it without training. This insight is driving the prioritization of persona-level artifacts, pre-generated views, and improved homepage experience---assuming users won\'t read documentation or watch training videos.

The workbook-to-workspace artifact approach proved far superior to the initial plain-text implementation. What started as a workaround---passing text fields---evolved after Lars\'s team recommended using the artifacts infrastructure instead. The result: clicking an email in workspace opens a full artifact in chat that users can drill into, and the pattern scales to slides, account briefs, and any other artifact. This learning reinforces that taking the extra investment upfront for high-confidence features pays dividends versus hacking quick MVPs that require later rework.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Workspace and Studio execution relies heavily on the Agentic platform team, but that group faces severe resourcing constraints. Key engineers like Ryan Stevens, Josh, and Grant get pulled into fires across workbooks, workspace, and backend systems, forcing constant trade-offs. Adam and Lars identified this as the primary quality and velocity issue---teams move quickly by taking shortcuts, then spend cycles cleaning up those shortcuts as products near prime time. The path forward requires more granular resource allocation in JIRA and potentially pulling back some loaned engineers to dedicated ownership.

Marc\'s platform work on GTM Data Model normalization unlocks substantial value for both workspace and Studio, but timing and resourcing remain uncertain. While resources are aligned and planning kicks off next week, the teams are \"pretty booked right now.\" This foundational work---standardizing field values across multiple CRMs---will dramatically simplify filtering and searching, directly supporting the multi-CRM use cases that differentiate our platform. Tushar has given strong feedback on prioritizing this after working with GraphQL.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week is \"the most hectic one\" as Dominik noted---the day after release is actually more chaotic than before. The team expects significant feedback volume as sales begins demoing at scale and will need to respond with rapid iteration. Victor plans a product momentum push in mid-November addressing chat UX, view improvements, and more prominent artifacts. The goal is a follow-up release on November 10th hitting quick wins that build on Monday\'s foundation.

Priorities for the coming week center on three areas: stabilizing post-launch with fast fixes for highest-impact issues, continuing enablement as the full field gets access, and maintaining discipline on the Q1 Plays timeline. Dominik was emphatic that Plays must not slip from end-of-Q1---the downstream impacts of compromising would be massive, and the team cannot let Monday\'s success create pressure to accelerate an incomplete solution. Vision casting and early access are appropriate; pulling in launch dates is not.

The broader H2 narrative is crystallizing around credit consumption as the primary business model for 2026. Dominik\'s board meeting reinforced that next year\'s success depends on optimizing for consumption, with the roadmap focused on agents that drive meaningful credit usage. This frames every product decision going forward: the primitives that enable automation, the data sets that enrich agent capabilities, and the orchestration that ties it all together. The team demonstrated strong momentum this week; next week tests whether they can maintain velocity while managing the chaos of a major launch.

## **GTM Studio Team Weekly Report - October 27-31, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The week before our November 3rd launch proved decisive as all workstreams converged on release readiness. Workbooks completed field enablement sessions covering foundations, competitive positioning, and demo deep dives while finalizing product briefs, demo videos, and new import/enrich modals to showcase our data ecosystem breadth. Plays pushed the initial release to staging with workflow creation flows operational and began finalizing the M1 testing plan, though front-end restyling work stands at 50% complete heading into the final week. ROI Analytics verified GTM Data Store backfilled historical data in the dev environment, with the CFA team planning cutover to the new data store by November 12th---giving three weeks to validate everything ahead of the December 9th GA release---while multi-currency support completed testing in staging and moved toward production deployment. Data Management prioritized the next batch of 10 accounts with account managers for data health scan outreach, completed PRD review for the M3 GTM Studio version, and kicked off development work, though front-end resource allocation from Denis\' team remains the primary execution dependency.

**Key Momentum Areas**

Field enablement accelerated GTM readiness across all customer-facing teams: Jagannath, Tanvi, and Sneh ran comprehensive enablement sessions this week covering GTM Studio foundations for the broader field, competitive positioning with dedicated Clay objection handling, and SC/CX demo deep dives. The sessions equipped solutions consultants with production-ready demo paths and gave account managers the narrative and data points needed for customer conversations. Customer cohort workbooks analyzing use case fit went live, with VPs activating these to their teams alongside a dedicated prospecting block on Monday, November 3rd---moving strategy directly into execution.

November 3rd release scope locked with go/no-go decisions finalized: Jagannath and the team made critical scope decisions on semantic enrichment (go---scalability achieved), deep research (go as available but limited scale), and studio chat enhancements (complete and in production). The clarification step improvement now forces the agent to present multiple solution options when user intent is unclear, significantly improving UX based on early user feedback. All P0/P1 bugs for copilot activation were addressed for release readiness, with enablement materials delivered to the GTM team.

Data management feedback driving rapid POC iteration: Corina and the team iterated the Data Health Scan POC to v2.0 based on feedback, adding key enhancements including benchmark comparisons, business impact explanations for each metric (e.g., \"21.1% missing job titles prevents decision-maker segmentation\"), and person-moved tracking. Customer Success showed strong interest in using these reports for churn prevention, creating a dual motion: account management for upsells and customer success for retention and increased adoption.

**Goals & Progress**

**Workbooks**

**Progress - Launch readiness materials finalized and production demos operational:** All product briefs, walkthrough videos for signals, pitch content, compete objection handling, and how-to guides reached near-completion status requiring only final polish. Sneh, Tanvi, and the enablement team ran field-wide sessions while solutions consultants confirmed production-ready demo paths with template workbooks created specifically for customer use cases. New import and enrich modals were finalized with Alex and the design team to better showcase ZoomInfo\'s data ecosystem breadth, while the team began incorporating account priority score (APS) into the enrichment flow through quick-turnaround requirements and design collaboration.

**Strategic Challenges - Semantic enrichment coverage and enablement depth require continued attention (Clear path forward):** While semantic enrichment achieved the scalability needed for go-live, data coverage and quality concerns remain for post-launch iteration, with identified gaps in how the feature handles four distinct states: data available with answer, data available but no answer found, semantic data unavailable, and downstream service failures. The last two states create user confusion by returning empty cells with no differentiation. Enablement across field, support, and SC teams needs strengthening as many lack clear understanding of what semantic enrichment is, how it works, and how it differentiates from standard enrichment. AI credits releasing on November 3rd means the first real-world production testing happens on launch day itself, creating unknown unknowns. The redesigned enrich catalog will deploy behind a feature flag with 20+ connectors available in the production tenant, with global publishing timeline still to be determined. Workspace activation delivers the core story but remains bare bones, requiring rapid iteration cycles post-launch to maintain seller confidence.

**Plays**

**Progress - M1 milestone deployed to staging with core workflows operational:** Neha and the engineering team successfully pushed the PR to staging, making GTM Plays accessible with the feature flag enabled. Core user flows including creating workflows from scratch, adding tools and custom agents as workflow nodes, and running for single inputs are functioning properly. End-to-end testing for M1-supported tools shows Salesforce and CRM tools fully operational, while Gmail sending works though read/search remain blocked, and web search tools function correctly. The team finalized the testing plan covering all M1 functional flows and began QA coordination, while front-end CSS and styling changes progressed to approximately 50% completion with Wednesday as the target date for completion.

**Strategic Challenges - Tool completeness and front-end restyling pace require close management through launch week (No additional action required):** While core functionality reached staging successfully, end-to-end tool testing revealed mixed results requiring continued attention. LinkedIn scraper needs additional work to fetch company and contact profile URLs---estimated at roughly one day of effort but not yet complete. The team also identified routing as a new tool requirement critical for supporting inbound and outbound use cases, kicking off early discovery work that must be carefully managed against the November 3rd timeline. Front-end restyling work standing at 50% with a Wednesday deadline means the final 48 hours will be tight. Tool documentation for QA and internal users is being collated to ensure alignment on supported operations and use cases, critical for smooth production deployment planned for early November with phased rollout starting with product team testing.

**ROI Analytics**

**Progress - GTM Data Store migration validation on track for December GA with multi-currency testing complete:** Arun and the platform team completed verification of backfilled historical data in the dev environment, with the CFA team planning cutover to the new GTM Data Store by November 12th. This timeline provides three weeks to validate everything comprehensively ahead of the December 9th GA release. Multi-currency support completed exhaustive testing in the staging environment and is ready for production deployment, initially rolling out to beta customers next week. Discovery work began on unifying workbook, workspace, plays, and AI credits into a consolidated ROI framework, with discussions held with the DoubleO team and Adam\'s team to understand how to correlate everything to sales outcomes and efficiency metrics.

**Strategic Challenges - Workbook instrumentation prioritization blocks embedded analytics progress (Clear path forward):** The instrumentation and pipeline setup process from workbook data sources has not yet been prioritized by Jagannath and Randy, creating a dependency that must be resolved this week to maintain forward momentum on the M3 milestone for Studio and Workspace ROI analytics. Several open questions remain around how the embedded workbook analytics agent artifact should update each time it loads, preventing finalization of the engineering execution plan. The team continues discussions with Jesse and others to establish the unified framework for communicating ROI more effectively across all GTM Studio components, with next steps requiring clearer scope definition around workspaces Q4 analytics following Adam\'s roadmap clarification.

**Data Management**

**Progress - M1 prototype refinement and M3 development kickoff advance dual-track execution:** Corina and the team completed version 2 of the data health scan proof of concept incorporating customer and account manager feedback including person-moved metrics, benchmarks showing comparison against ZoomInfo\'s internal CRM data, and enrichment match rate projections demonstrating potential fill rate improvements. The team prioritized the next batch of 10 accounts with high renewal potential in H1 for targeted outreach, using projected upsell value based on record counts to focus on strategic accounts first. Customer Success showed strong interest in using reports for churn prevention and increased adoption, creating a new retention-focused motion alongside the upsell strategy. For M3, Corina completed the PRD review for bringing data health scan into GTM Studio, kicked off development work, and secured front-end resources from Denis\' team.

**Strategic Challenges - Front-end resource confirmation and logic specification need final validation (Clear path forward):** While Denis\' team assigned front-end resources, final confirmation is still needed to ensure no execution gaps as development ramps up. The team is working this week to button up the exact logic and requirements for benchmarks, enrichment match rates, and other calculations to ensure engineering teams have precise specifications matching what\'s already built and tested on the data services side. Brandon Tucker\'s Friday feedback session surfaced valuable input on person-moved metrics and other enhancements that Corina is documenting and incorporating where feasible for the January release. The narrative validation with account managers and customers continues to ensure messaging resonates and clearly articulates business impact, with version 2 of the prototype expected this week followed by a larger 600-customer run primarily for Customer Success to use in churn prevention conversations.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Customer Success identified churn prevention application creating dual revenue motion: Customer Success teams expressed strong interest in using data health scan reports for accounts approaching renewal, discovering a use case beyond the original account management upsell strategy. They want to understand what packages customers purchased, track credit usage and remaining balance, then use the data health scan to spot gaps---for example, showing a customer with 40% job title fill rates and a million unused credits, then helping them enrich that data to increase adoption. This creates complementary motions: account management for upsells to new customers, and customer success for retention and deeper adoption with existing customers.

Workspace activation naturally connects to Plays in seller conversations but requires clear product distinction: During enablement sessions, account managers organically began framing workspace activation as \"Plays\" when talking to customers, validating the strategic direction but creating pressure to clarify product positioning. View publishing solves specific use cases around making data available to sellers, but the Plays automation engine addresses fundamentally different needs around process orchestration with actions and real-time execution. Sellers need tasks and to-dos, not just published views. The team must establish clear delineation between when customers use view publishing versus when they need full Play automation, ensuring these capabilities complement rather than compete with each other as both move toward production.

Early access program reveals need for use case templates and starter guidance: Customers consistently request more guidance on workbook use cases and starter templates, with many feeling overwhelmed by available data and functionality without clear starting points. Of the 22 early access accounts, only 4 are healthy and getting value, with an additional 3 seeing value but stuck without activation paths. Users want to see what other customers are building for creative ideas and need structured onboarding showing them what\'s possible. The request for use case templates emerged strongly across multiple customer conversations, indicating a gap between product capability and customer ability to ideate and execute independently.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

GTM Data Store opportunity history data validation remains in progress (No additional action required): Andres Perez and Asaf\'s platform team completed the backfill of historical opportunity data, which Arun verified in the dev environment. The CFA team continues validation work on data accuracy and quality, with results expected by Monday and a switchover plan to be finalized by end of week. This dependency is actively being worked through established channels with clear ownership and timeline, enabling the December 9th GA target.

Semantic enrichment infrastructure migration to Google Deep Search service (Clear path forward): Deep research infrastructure needs to move from Mellifera to Google\'s Deep Search service to improve coverage beyond the current 60-70% result rate. Ryan Steven indicated this is minimal work, with the team planning to execute the migration next week while early users continue getting value from the MVP version. No additional intervention required as the path forward is established and scheduled, though the team will monitor whether 60-70% coverage proves sufficient for initial launch based on customer feedback.

Front-end resource allocation for M3 Data Health Scan in GTM Studio: While Denis\' team assigned front-end developers, final confirmation of resource availability and allocation is needed to ensure development work can progress without gaps. Corina is working directly with Denis and the assigned developers to lock in capacity and timelines, with resolution expected this week to maintain the January delivery target for bringing data health scan into GTM Studio.

**Looking Ahead**

November 3rd launch week demands field focus and rapid iteration cycles: With product going live Monday, the entire team shifts focus to supporting customers, sales teams, and solutions consultants as they begin using GTM Studio in production at scale. This means maintaining tight feedback loops with the field, triaging incoming bugs and issues quickly, coordinating fixes across engineering teams, and identifying quick wins that can be deployed rapidly to address friction points. Tanvi will focus on UI stories for queue management, stopping runs, and running single row/column/cell operations while continuing design progress on find contact enhancements. Jagannath prioritizes onboarding early access customers to new capabilities, migrating deep research to new infrastructure if not completed this week, and locking in December 1st release scope with engineering.

ROI and Data Management execution accelerates toward year-end milestones: Arun will finalize the approach for workflow embedded analytics POC and start instrumentation discussions with the Workspace team while monitoring GTM Data Store validation results. Brahm connects with Gabe Sweet\'s enablement team to ensure all materials are ready for December rollout and follows up with Mary\'s implementation team on their role in customer onboarding. Corina circulates version 2 of the data health scan to the prioritized account list, validates narrative and benchmarks with account managers and customers, and begins fleshing out requirements for M5 AI onboarding in collaboration with Urmzd from the machine learning engineering team. For M3, she works with engineering to finalize logic specifications matching the tested data services implementation.

December planning and backlog grooming ensure sustained delivery momentum: With November 3rd scope locked and launching, the team must complete shovel readiness for December 1st capabilities to maintain engineering velocity. Jagannath leads Jira cleanup and alignment on prioritized items, ensuring all descoped work from quality focus is revisited and properly sequenced. Mohan continues driving copilot activation support including bug identification and quick wins, while finalizing M2 scope for GTM Plays through front-end and back-end engineering alignment calls focused on December timeline feasibility. Neha onboards new engineering team members with knowledge transfer sessions alongside Derek and Kartik, documenting nuanced context to align everyone including product and QA members not originally from the DoubleO team, critical as the platform scales and more teams contribute.

## **Data Executive Team Weekly Report - Oct 27-30, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team successfully positioned a Contributory Network Deal Cycle Analysis agent for board demonstration, with Brandon Wilson completing full pipeline validation and achieving staging deployment. This represents a tangible showcase of how customer data can power actionable insights for sales leaders. Brandon Tucker is driving waterfall enrichment requirements to address competitive gaps with Clay, planning a December launch of free supplemental data enrichment that maintains quality standards while matching competitor features. Meanwhile, Igor Kyrylenko expanded professional licenses coverage to 20 states with 11 fully standardized, positioning FINRA data for productization with Wells Fargo showing early interest.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Brandon Wilson achieved a significant milestone by completing the deal cycle analysis agent pipeline for the board meeting demonstration. The agent successfully answers complex questions about tenant deal velocity and provides actionable benchmarks using normalized Contributory Network opportunity data. After resolving data architecture challenges around the GTM opportunity table structure, the team eliminated the need for GraphQL calls by properly handling multi-row stage data, resulting in a more efficient and cost-effective solution that processes 2 terabytes of data for eligible tenants.

Steve Hutchinson\'s team launched testing of Clickagy hashed email data as a validation source for email generation, addressing a multi-year opportunity to leverage cookie-based email evidence. The analysis will determine whether emails observed during web browsing provide reliable signals of deliverability, potentially unlocking a high-volume feature for the data science email generation model. Initial test design is complete with results expected by week\'s end, and if successful, this could significantly expand international contact publishing and improve email coverage across published profiles.

Igor Kyrylenko reached 20 states of professional licenses data acquisition with 11 states fully processed in standardized format, demonstrating clear progress toward comprehensive national coverage. The team simultaneously ingested FINRA data into Snowflake with views created for both individual brokers and firms, positioning it for productization discussions. Working with Peter and planning to engage Nick Marinaro, the team is preparing FINRA as a credible alternative to PitchBook, with Wells Fargo expressing interest in using this data to identify individual brokers and investors.

**Goals & Progress**

**Contributory Network Deal Insights:** Brandon Wilson completed full pipeline evaluation and staging deployment of the deal cycle analysis agent, ready for board demonstration. The solution leverages the GTM opportunity table directly rather than GraphQL, handling multi-row stage data to provide complete opportunity timelines. Key learning revealed that opportunity amounts and other fields previously thought to require GraphQL integration are available in the opportunity table when properly aggregated, simplifying the architecture and reducing costs associated with 2-terabyte data scans.

**Waterfall Enrichment Strategy:** Brandon Tucker documented comprehensive requirements for waterfall enrichment capabilities, shared with John and the person data team for implementation planning. The initiative aims to match Clay\'s supplemental enrichment features while maintaining quality standards through PTI\'s 50-accuracy score construct. ByteMine data shows exceptional promise with nearly 12 million mobile numbers available for US contacts lacking mobiles, representing significant coverage expansion. The team plans to make this free to customers, positioning it as a competitive differentiator that highlights ZoomInfo\'s commitment to quality data over volume-only approaches.

**Vertical Dataset Expansion:** Igor Kyrylenko standardized 11 of 20 acquired professional licenses states into unified layouts, accelerating future processing despite challenges from states like Ohio with 11 different data formats. FINRA data reached production-ready status in Snowflake with proper schema and views for investors and firms, advancing toward Wells Fargo productization discussions. The team is collaborating with Sandeep\'s offshore resources to accelerate additional state acquisitions and completed automation tooling for bulk email-based data requests, pending final legal approval before deployment across multiple dataset types.

**Board of Directors Data Product:** Jody Roberts advanced requirements documentation for board of directors and executive leadership data offerings, working to transition from manual research-driven approaches to automated, scalable solutions. The team identified opportunities to improve person profile classification accuracy and is exploring coverage gaps to determine whether automated pipelines alone provide sufficient data or if custom list processing remains necessary. Brandon Tucker raised important questions about comprehensive board coverage per company, suggesting new crawling requirements and potential XVerum contributions to ensure customers can reliably view full boards for target companies.

**Company 3.0 Requirements:** Ethan Young progressed on HQ address and location profiling requirements documentation, with design decisions finalized and on track for end-of-week completion. A significant technical advancement emerged from Company Master Enriched endpoint work, where improved match service location matching logic can substantially benefit person data by increasing location ID coverage for contacts. The team also successfully redeployed the PDD pipeline with improved accuracy metrics, completing QA validation ahead of board meeting and earnings reporting deadlines.

**Strategic Challenges**

Privacy and compliance work surfaced an active board member complaint regarding notification delivery to a guest email that had not received proper privacy notices. Suresh Putteti is coordinating with legal to analyze the issue and understand gaps in the notification process, which has implications for board of directors data handling more broadly. This reinforces the need for robust data lineage and notification tracking as the team scales automated approaches to leadership data collection and distribution.

Data architecture decisions around the GTM Store and GraphQL revealed gaps between promised functionality and current implementation. Brandon Wilson discovered that GraphQL lacks opportunity history views with stage progression data, requiring continued reliance on direct table queries that scan terabytes of data. Steve Hutchinson previously escalated this gap, and the team is creating opportunity history objects for GraphQL, but timing remains unclear. This creates uncertainty around whether to build on GraphQL infrastructure or continue optimizing direct data access patterns, with cost and maintainability implications for multiple ongoing initiatives.

Board of directors data quality issues persist despite planned fixes, with Brandon Tucker identifying that board member classifications remain in employment history rather than proper board sections on person profiles. The team needs comprehensive queries to identify misclassified records and validation of whether recent changes actually resolved the underlying problems. Additionally, the path to comprehensive board coverage per company remains unclear, requiring new crawling capabilities and potentially SEC filing integrations that aren\'t yet scoped or resourced.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The GTM opportunity table contains richer historical data than GraphQL when properly structured, enabling full opportunity lifecycle analysis without expensive API calls. Brandon Wilson learned that multiple rows per opportunity tracking stage progression provide complete timelines that GraphQL\'s most-recent-record approach misses. This architectural insight reduces costs substantially and suggests that GraphQL\'s value proposition around change data capture and simplified access may not apply equally across all data types, particularly for historical analysis requiring full audit trails.

Clickagy hashed email data presents a multi-year opportunity finally reaching production testing, demonstrating how organizational priorities and technical complexity can delay high-value integrations. Steve Hutchinson\'s analysis will validate whether cookie-based email observations provide reliable deliverability signals, potentially unlocking massive coverage expansion. The team learned that even well-performing data sources face non-technical hurdles including legal frameworks and data storage considerations that must be resolved before scale implementation.

Jody Roberts discovered that using ZI Chat with micro-apps to analyze Chorus calls across large DaaS opportunities reveals unplanned dataset requests from top customers. This agent-powered approach to surfacing customer needs identified over 20 potential dataset opportunities not on current roadmaps, demonstrating how conversational AI can extract strategic insights from existing interaction data. The insight suggests that modular approaches to existing core data may unlock quick wins alongside the structured vertical dataset motion.

ByteMine integration quality exceeded expectations based on initial LinkedIn joins, showing nearly 12 million mobile coverage opportunities for contacts currently lacking phone data. Brandon Tucker noted this represents a significant portion of the 30 million US LinkedIn-associated contacts without mobiles, making it a high-impact data source. The strong match rates validate the decision to pursue ByteMine and suggest similar third-party data integrations may merit acceleration when quality indicators are favorable.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

GraphQL infrastructure development from the platform team remains essential for long-term data architecture strategy, but current gaps require the data team to maintain dual approaches. Brandon Wilson needs opportunity history views with stage progression, while person and company data migration to Attribute Store depends on GraphQL supporting change data capture consistently. The team should provide structured feedback to the GraphQL working group about missing functionality and continue monitoring the opportunity history object development timeline to plan migration paths.

Waterfall enrichment implementation requires coordination across PTI, platform, search, and apps teams to execute by the December deadline Brandon Tucker established. The data team has requirements documented and data indexed appropriately, but success depends on cross-functional alignment around how to surface supplemental data, when to show enrichment options, and how to handle accuracy scoring in the user interface. An off-site working session is planned to compress development cycles, but realistic timeline assessment depends on other teams\' bandwidth and prioritization.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on translating this week\'s progress into customer-ready capabilities and board demonstration materials. Brandon Wilson will build local pipeline infrastructure for the deal cycle agent with full data composition and quality validation, setting the stage for engineering handoff. The board demonstration represents a pivotal moment to showcase how contributory network data powers actionable intelligence for sales leaders.

Brandon Tucker will document platform and apps requirements for waterfall enrichment, detailing data location, accuracy implications, and display logic to enable the December launch target. The requirements must address how 5x5 and ByteMine contacts appear only in enrichment contexts while maintaining quality standards in search and other features. Simultaneously, he\'ll work with Hazmic\'s team on shared services normalization and classification needs as two additional engineering resources become available for that work.

Igor Kyrylenko will continue professional licenses acquisition and processing toward coverage critical mass while advancing FINRA productization with customer-facing data points and schema refinement. The automated acquisition tool for bulk email requests awaits final legal approval before deployment across automotive dealerships and other verticals, representing a significant acceleration of data collection capabilities. Success here validates the automation investment and opens pathways for rapid expansion into new regulated industries where public records provide comprehensive coverage.

## **SalesOS/Copilot Team Weekly Report - Oct 27-30, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Sean Walter is refocusing the December roadmap around three core themes following the GTM data model pivot: features that deliver aha moments and help sell the product, platform narrative connections (workbooks/GTM Datastore integration), and validated high-priority user feedback addressing fundamental gaps. The shift toward GTM data model integration represents a significant architectural decision that won\'t disrupt the roadmap substantially---a POC is feasible for December that will enable view creation across different datasets, addressing current limitations around data source joining. Meanwhile, the 2K limit workaround using recommended filters is progressing toward Monday\'s release, though Sean expresses 60% confidence in the November 3rd sales readiness milestone due to chat accuracy concerns and latency issues that continue to erode user trust.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Copilot Workspace readiness advances despite architectural complexity. Sean Walter completed a refocused December roadmap document based on GTM data model requirements, user analytics, and consolidated feedback, organizing priorities around three coherent themes: delivering aha moments that help sell the product, advancing the platform narrative through workbooks and GTM Datastore connections, and addressing validated high-priority user feedback on fundamental functionality gaps. The team confirmed with Andres that a GTM data model proof-of-concept is feasible for December, which will enable users to create views based on the GTM data model and join across different datasets---addressing significant limitations around joining between data sources and reducing integration effort for new datasets.

ZoomInfo Intent work unblocks critical competitive capabilities. Hari Krishnamoorthy discovered that 40% of customers who should be receiving Intent recommendations are not getting them---approximately 1,246 out of 3,206 qualified customers---and escalated this pipeline issue to the data science team for immediate investigation, with a review call scheduled to determine root cause and next course of action. Hari completed technical discovery for Account Level Intent in Copilot Workspace by identifying three integration approaches: manual field addition to ZoomInfo section (available immediately), MCP server or sub-agent conversion for agentic handoff, and direct view creation from Intent signals (highest customer value), with Lars emphasizing the need for evaluation framework modeling and the GTM Studio team confirming existing infrastructure can handle view creation once data flows into GTM Store.

Admin Zero Experience capabilities expand for Enterprise customers. David Goulden finalized documentation for the bulk territory loader and completed info packs for Admin Defined Territories, with some UI tweaks for admins being worked on in the coming week for GA readiness. The team made progress testing GTM data model queries for Priority Accounts, documenting migration paths, though work continues on determining how to federate that into search and access it in other services, with a planned January target for moving existing customers with rules set up to GTM data model queries.

Next best actions: Ant Cuomo completed a final round of evaluations on the next best actions agent with over 10 internal sellers, concluding that NBA agent are giving accurate, credible recommendations that reps are finding valuable. Next steps are to work towards short-term and medium term platform integrations.

**Goals & Progress**

**Copilot Workspace:** Sean Walter reports 60% confidence in November 3rd sales readiness, citing concerns about the 2K limit issue and chat accuracy problems including latency complaints and incorrect data source selection, with the real test being how quickly the team can fix these fundamental problems. Adam Severance confirmed that work on 2K limits, recommended filters, and priority fields is green for Monday release in staging, though not yet fully end-to-end testable in staging, with the team having made hard decisions about the experience to land in the best possible place. The workspace is shifting focus from feature additions to user experience quality, with Victor Oliveros emphasizing that chat, artifacts, and views must improve markedly every week.

**ZoomInfo Intent:** Hari Krishnamoorthy conducted technical discovery for Account Level Intent integration, identifying that if Intent data successfully flows into GTM Store, the Copilot Workspace UI infrastructure can handle remaining view creation requirements, significantly de-risking implementation. Hari is working on a value proposition document explaining why customers would use Copilot Workspace instead of the Intent Tab and what additional value can be provided through consolidation. The discovery of the 40% recommendation gap represents both a challenge and an immediate addressable revenue opportunity once resolved.

**Admin Zero Experience:** David Goulden finalized bulk territory loader documentation, completed info packs for Admin Defined Territories release, and is putting together templates with additional documentation, with final UI tweaks for admins being worked on for GA readiness later in November. Work progressed on building an MCP interface to territories to open them to agents, with ongoing refinement with the search team to determine how to interface various system languages, since territories are currently stored in Ringlead rule syntax and structure. Customers are expressing strong demand for opening territories into both advanced search and workspaces.

**Additional Initiatives:** Gabe Pirela made progress refining email sequence requirements and solution direction after meetings with GTM Studio team, Studio Plays team, and orchestration teams, with updated requirements expected by end of week followed by a larger review session to ensure all use cases are covered. Gabe completed design review for workspace meetings (the Chorus convergence work), with design details expected by end of week and engineering starting work on basics, though pulses will be key to pushing actions and updates to users rather than having them find meeting or CRM update sections.

**Strategic Challenges**

Copilot Workspace faces fundamental chat reliability issues that threaten sales readiness. Sean Walter expressed 60% confidence in November 3rd readiness, with primary concerns around the 2K limit problem and chat feedback showing latency complaints and wrong data source selection, noting the real test is how quickly these problems can be fixed. For demos, Sean believes following a narrow path works reasonably well, but the biggest unknown is chat reliability---citing an example where asking about preparing for an Adobe meeting produced a good slideshow initially, but an hour later the same query didn\'t get proper context and produced lower quality results, indicating issues with chat understanding hierarchies, referencing recent data, and refining user questions. Adam Severance noted that chat-to-views base functionality is live in staging but not good enough, with most issues stemming from the prompt itself and the LLM not understanding how to navigate right use cases, requiring significant time from the product team to improve the orchestrator layer\'s understanding of their specific use case. The team needs chat to improve every single week, but current processes for agent iteration and refinement are proving time-consuming.

GTM data model dependencies create cross-team coordination complexity and timeline uncertainty. Sean Walter noted that GTM Config status has been quiet from his perspective with limited understanding of direction and timing, despite roadmap line items, and that the team needs to start driving requirements because users are providing feedback about missing context like \"why is it not knowing this about me or this about the company\". Sean emphasized the team needs a consolidated list of demands from the GTM data model across all team members, since GTM data model is central to success of most initiatives and a unified view of asks would help from a coherence perspective, impacting profile pages, views, chat, and other forward-looking features. David Goulden raised concerns after speaking with designer Julia about GTM Config work, noting they tend to design for net new customers but many existing customers won\'t go through full setup---they\'ve already half-configured the system---so the offering setup flow designed as if starting new won\'t work well for the installed base. This architectural dependency affects multiple workstreams and requires careful coordination to prevent downstream adoption issues.

Territory and Priority Accounts features face technical integration blockers limiting Enterprise customer capabilities. David Goulden indicated there are questions about how territories stored in Ringlead rule syntax can be opened up and made accessible in other places, requiring the team to figure out interfaces between various system languages. Customers are providing feedback expecting territory recommendations to get smarter based on companies they\'re turning down, but the recommendation engine doesn\'t currently incorporate that feedback even though it\'s being stored, creating unmet expectations for adaptive learning that emerge quickly in customer interactions. David noted that role-based rules for CRM matching won\'t likely go away since GTM config won\'t always know what users have at any given point in time, meaning a rule-matching interface will be needed to allow tuning, with UI work kicked off but requiring integration with GTM config systems. The path forward requires resolving how to make territories searchable objects while deciding whether to retrofit capabilities back into current advanced search or make them available only in workspaces.

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

User-level personalization emerges as critical unaccounted capability for chat effectiveness. Sean Walter identified that basic user-level personalization, particularly for chat, isn\'t accounted for in the current roadmap but needs urgent attention---users constantly ask \"is chat actually getting smarter, what does it know about me?\" and the answer is nothing outside conversation context, with the hypothesis that providing users basic ability to supply information operating like a system prompt would massively impact performance, accuracy, and buy significant goodwill. This insight connects directly to the chat reliability challenges and suggests a foundational architecture gap rather than purely prompt engineering issues.

GTM data model integration unlocks compound value beyond immediate technical benefits. The GTM data model proof-of-concept enables view creation by joining across different datasets, which is particularly important given limitations around joining between data sources and the work required to integrate any new data set, with Andres expressing high enthusiasm to solve previously discussed gaps including write-backs and field access. For Account Level Intent specifically, if data successfully flows into GTM Store, existing Copilot Workspace infrastructure handles remaining view creation requirements, significantly de-risking implementation and suggesting faster path to production than initially expected. The architectural decision to prioritize GTM data model integration creates platform leverage that accelerates multiple feature workstreams simultaneously.

Agent iteration velocity constraints threaten competitive product development pace. Ant Cuomo noted that the entire process of iterating and refining agents is taking a long time, with the account prioritization agent missing a merge and releases happening weekly, preventing the team from getting agents out in production for evaluation, leading to discussions with Lars and Ryan about improving the agent development process. Sean Walter emphasized that the recommended filter approach for the 2K limit is useful in itself but doesn\'t solve the core problem of seamlessly joining and filtering across data sources, with the algorithm behind recommendations needing improvement. Victor Oliveros requested a write-up on agent iteration challenges for product leadership, indicating this process constraint affects multiple teams and requires systematic resolution.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Agentic Platform team on chat improvements and agent development continues to be critical for workspace reliability and feature velocity. Adam Severance has daily calls with Eric and Tanmoy to improve chat-to-views functionality, with most issues stemming from the prompt and LLM not understanding how to navigate right use cases, requiring significant time from the product team to improve the orchestrator layer\'s understanding of the specific use case. Additionally, chat lacks ability to assess the number of rows being output, so the 2K limit creates problems---the team is moving forward with making that API available, and chat will need to take iterative passes to understand row counts and follow required logic for views to work properly. The dependency extends to mobile development, where Ant Cuomo reported good progress with Lars and the mobile team on handling chat, determining that investing in a scrappy web view isn\'t worthwhile given too many edge cases, instead pursuing a headless design approach where a JavaScript controller dictates what gets rendered natively, which can also be used in the new chrome extension.

Our collaboration with the GTM Data Model team has intensified around Priority Accounts and workspace data access. David Goulden reported good progress testing GTM data model queries for CRM data but noted it\'s unclear how to federate that into search or access it in other services, with target January timeline for moving existing customer base with configured rules over to GTM data model queries. Ant Cuomo is meeting with Andres and team to walk through end-to-end profiles and GraphQL queries to get needed data, with the call scheduled to identify any gaps. Cross-functional alignment is essential here as multiple product workstreams (profiles, views, Intent integration, Priority Accounts) depend on consistent data access patterns and query capabilities from this centralized system.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s primary focus centers on validating November 3rd sales readiness while advancing December architectural foundations. The team will conduct user experience walkthroughs of Monday\'s release package before calling features green, with Sean, Adam, and Victor reviewing what\'s shipping to ensure no surprises in the sales-ready milestone.

Top priorities include solidifying chat reliability and GTM data model integration paths. Adam Severance emphasized the need to dedicate significant team time to improving the chat prompt and overall orchestrator understanding, noting there are many fronts for improving chat generally and chat-to-views specifically, requiring clarity on next steps and weekly improvement cadence. Sean will compile consolidated GTM data model requirements and demands across the team since it\'s central to most initiatives, providing unified visibility into asks that will impact profiles, views, chat, and forward-looking features. Hari will work with engineering on high-level plans and timelines for Account Level Intent in Workspace while developing the value proposition for why customers should use Workspace over the Intent Tab. David will finalize templates and prototypes showing where territories can be used in existing screens and workspaces, while continuing Priority Accounts migration work. Gabe will review final designs for workspace meetings and groom epics to start development November 1st as planned, while finalizing email sequence requirements for larger team review.

We\'re moving from broad capability building to targeted experience refinement. The architectural decisions around GTM data model integration and user-level personalization will compound benefits across multiple features, but execution depends on resolving agent iteration velocity constraints and chat reliability issues. With sales enablement starting November 3rd, the team has limited runway to address fundamental experience gaps---success requires ruthless prioritization of improvements that directly impact the narrow demo paths while building sustainable foundations for post-launch iteration.

## **Intelligence Team Weekly Report - October 27-31, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team is in the final stages of shipping the November 3rd release for Copilot Workspace with slides, citations, recent Chorus engagements, and view creation via chat. However, three critical issues demand immediate attention: costs are unsustainably high due to unoptimized context and expensive models, performance is slower than acceptable, and semantic data coverage gaps are creating user frustration. Lars Vedo and Ryan Stevens are leading the November 3rd launch while managing technical debt from rapid prototyping, with Carlos Nunez stabilizing the workbooks-semantic data integration that nearly derailed the release timeline. A decision was also made to process all account\'s engagement data using the Semantic service so we can close the gap on missing engagement data next week.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Lead by Dylan Halladay, slides functionality was enabled in production ahead of the board meeting and rolling out to test users now. Additionally, inline citations for Semantic, Chorus, and Salesforce sources are rolling out now. The new agent architecture with improved sub-agents is being tested behind feature flags, enabling users to create views via chat and leverage ZoomInfo data more effectively, setting up a strong foundation for the Monday release.

Carlos Nunez and the infrastructure team rescued the workbooks integration by implementing a temporal solution for batch agent execution over an intense weekend sprint. After identifying that bulk semantic data requests were consuming daily token limits, the team deployed automated stops and improved logging, demonstrating the power of focused vertical squads to ship critical functionality under pressure.

Derek Osgood pushed all M1 plays functionality into staging, with core orchestration, ZoomInfo, email, and CRM tools now live and ready for QA. The team achieved clarity on cross-functional dependencies after productive sessions in Bethesda and Waltham, positioning plays to support both basic use cases and the more complex pulse activation scenarios that sales teams are requesting.

**Goals & Progress**

**Agentic Platform & Copilot Workspace:** Lars Vedo\'s team is 95% complete on the November 3rd release, with slides in production, citations working for multiple sources, and the new agent with sub-agents in testing. Target accounts bug fixed and email functionality opening in Gmail as planned. Creating views via chat and improved ZoomInfo data integration are currently in testing on staging. The team is managing scope carefully after learning that rapid prototyping created maintenance overhead, with emailer requiring a rebuild and several \"quick win\" features from earlier demos now requiring significant polish work.

**Infrastructure & Semantic Data:** Carlos Nunez stabilized the workbooks-to-semantic-data pipeline after discovering that bulk requests were hitting Anthropic token limits. The temporal-based batch execution system is now processing requests reliably for approximately 14,000 accounts with semantic data. The team identified that vector search alone doesn\'t serve all semantic query types well, recognizing the need for a query router with both vector and text search capabilities as a longer-term solution. Web search is working for bulk operations, and the team plans to consolidate two separate web search paths into a single agent post-release.

**Plays & GTM Intelligence:** Derek Osgood completed all M1 plays functionality in staging, including orchestration tools, ZoomInfo tool, email tool, and CRM tool. Andy Harjanto has been assigned initial connector work for Global Event Bus and go-to-market store integration. Srivatsa Marthi finalized the architecture for migrating signals into plays, determining that the team can skip the temporary GSO integration and move directly to the end-state solution since key CDC events will be available by Q4. Next week focuses on QA of tools and defining requirements for filtering logic and GTM store attribute schemas.

**Strategic Challenges**

The team is experiencing \"death by a thousand cuts\" from maintaining too many quickly-prototyped features that demonstrated well but weren\'t built for scale. Target accounts, workbooks activation, and the emailer all required significant rework this week when moving from demo to production-ready. This maintenance burden is compounded by the agentic team supporting multiple product surfaces simultaneously, with Ryan Stevens and Josh White being pulled across workbooks, workspace, and other initiatives. The lesson learned is clear: tighter scope management and building for reliability from the start would prevent this technical debt accumulation.

Three critical technical issues require immediate focus beyond the release. First, costs are \"crazy high\" according to Lars, with unoptimized context, expensive models, and unnecessary LLM calls driving unsustainable spend. Second, performance is lagging user expectations, directly related to the cost issues through extra LLM calls and inefficient context handling. Third, semantic data coverage is incomplete - users expect to chat about any engagement visible in Chorus, but the current approach only uses semantic data, creating frustration. Hitting Chorus directly would blow up context windows and require weeks of work, making comprehensive semantic coverage the strongly preferred path forward.

Semantic data infrastructure needs urgent attention earlier than originally planned. Rowan Bailey restructured the Q4 roadmap to address infrastructure demands from Copilot Workspace alongside the original GTM Studio timeline. Three blockers emerged: uncertainty around whether the GraphQL API delay affects MCP Gateway launch in mid-December, lack of semantic data for expected accounts due to conservative cost-control filters that now cause more friction than value, and confusion around admin portal migration paths as products package together in unclear ways.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The weekend war room approach proved its value when Carlos Nunez\'s team and platform members worked vertically to solve the workbooks-semantic data integration crisis. What Jagannath initially estimated as weeks of work was completed in two days through focused collaboration without competing meetings. The tradeoff is clear: vertical squads sacrifice platform-wide alignment for shipping speed, which is acceptable when closely monitored to prevent teams from diverging into incompatible directions. Ryan Stevens and Lars Vedo\'s \"power move\" of forming temporary vertical teams delivers product to users most efficiently, even if it limits broader platform work.

Carlos Nunez discovered that bulk semantic data requests can consume the entire daily Anthropic token limit, exposing gaps in observability and automated safeguards. The team is now implementing better logging and automatic stops to prevent one bulk operation from starving all agents of tokens. Additionally, vector search alone proved insufficient for all semantic query types - the team identified the need for a query router that can choose between vector search and traditional text search depending on the query, similar to production-scale retrieval systems. These infrastructure learnings highlight the gap between prototype and production-ready systems.

Robyn Sablosky\'s updates:

- Lookalike Accounts, now covering the entire ZoomInfo universe of accounts with an API-called approach for the long tail. The team validated that API calls are infrequent enough for the bottom 20% of accounts that real-time neural network scoring is cost-effective.

- Three new MCPs for ranking algorithms (Account Priority Score, Lookalikes Accounts, Lookalike Contacts) went live in staging for AI chat testing, allowing the team to experiment with whether algorithms work better as standalone tools or combined with other capabilities.

- Robyn submitted designs to the Workbooks team for how to use Scoring + Lookalike Algorithms in their product

- IMS to be released next week: The In-Market Score (IMS) shows which accounts are actively showing interest in a company based on real-time behaviors and external signals. It combines data such The In-Market Score (IMS) shows which accounts are actively showing interest in a company based on real-time behaviors and external activity. It combines data from multiple sources --- including CRM opportunities, engagements, user usage data, S2A signals, WebSights, G2 and TrustRadius activity, account-level intent, Scoops, and Account Recommender vector candidates --- into one unified score.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Work with the GTM Data Model team, particularly Majed and Linda, is critical for finalizing signal namespaces in GTM Store. Srivatsa Marthi discovered the current unified namespace approach doesn\'t align with the architecture needed for plays, requiring each signal type to have its own namespace. The Global Event Bus dependency with Mark Frail is tracking to approximately one week from completion, allowing the team to skip temporary GSO integration and build the permanent solution directly. Platform team coordination around inference proxy, prompt store, and BYOK continues to be a strategic dependency that affects both agentic and semantic data capabilities.

The Context Service work crosses multiple teams as Rowan Bailey works with Ali\'s organization on MCP Gateway, Vinod and Imesh on GraphQL API timeline, and the GTM Config team on defining packages and access patterns. The freemium/ZI Lite program is 80% complete leveraging earlier PLG work, positioned to let users try ZoomInfo\'s MCP tools in Claude and ChatGPT before becoming full customers. Derek Osgood\'s plays initiative depends on front-end React resources that are scarce company-wide, creating a constraint on the next wave of features. The team needs dedicated design resourcing commitments from Sean Walter\'s group to maintain momentum.

**Looking Ahead**

The November 3rd release on Monday represents a major milestone, but the team immediately shifts focus to three priorities: cost optimization, performance improvements, and expanding semantic data coverage. Lars Vedo and Ryan Stevens will lead agentic tuning and fast-follows including email sending, notes as a data source, and Outreach integration.

Derek Osgood\'s team spends next week on comprehensive QA of all tools in staging before rolling out the first plays to internal users. Srivatsa Marthi finalizes filtering requirements for Andy Harjanto to begin connector implementation while updating GTM Store attribute schemas. Carlos Nunez consolidates the dual web search paths into a single robust agent and works with Rowan Bailey to prioritize semantic data infrastructure improvements. The team must balance shipping new features with addressing the underlying technical debt and cost issues before they become unsustainable.

Looking further ahead, the pulses use cases from Ant\'s team require more complex trigger combinations than initially planned - triggers with filters and time-based conditions. Ryan McMaster explores mobile experiences for frontline sellers while Derek Osgood scopes sequencing tooling to track exit criteria for plays acting as sequence orchestrators. The vision is coming together for end-to-end GTM intelligence from plays to pulses to frontline execution, but communicating this new product architecture will require sustained effort across the organization as it represents an entirely new way of thinking about how products connect.

## **MCP Tiger Team Weekly Report - October 27-31, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The MCP Gateway implementation reached 90% completion this week with three critical infrastructure components now operational. Carter completed the control plane APIs with MongoDB persistence and API key management, while Zheng finished the OAuth flow implementation and began request routing development. The team is tracking toward mid-December gateway availability, with a clear path to refactoring existing tools into the new architecture in January. Holiday coverage planning is now documented given significant team time off between Christmas and New Year\'s.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Carter delivered the control plane APIs with working MongoDB connections and persistence layers, establishing the foundation for tool registration and metadata management. He\'s coordinating with DevOps to ensure proper API key infrastructure, resolving technical gaps as they emerge in the MCP specification from Anthropic.

Zheng completed the OAuth flow implementation and successfully tested it with the MCP inspector. This authentication layer is now ready for Claude integration testing next week, unblocking the request routing work that will enable the gateway to intelligently direct incoming requests to appropriate downstream MCP servers.

The dynamic client registration capability, developed collaboratively by Zheng and Topher, enables new tool creators to define schemas and automatically generate boilerplate code. This automation will accelerate tool development once the gateway is operational.

**Goals & Progress**

**Gateway Core Infrastructure:** The team achieved 90% completion on foundational gateway components. Control plane APIs are implemented and being tested, OAuth flow is complete and validated with MCP inspector, and request routing architecture is defined with implementation starting next week. Carter and Zheng will work closely on request routing since much of that functionality derives from control plane metadata.

**Tool Integration Pipeline:** Dynamic client registration is operational, allowing schema-driven tool creation with automated code generation. The type spec work led by Harsh (supporting the team externally) is progressing to complement this capability. Tool tagging implementation from the previous Salesforce integration provides a foundation to build upon for routing logic.

**Production Readiness:** DevOps coordination is underway to establish proper API key management and infrastructure requirements. The team is identifying and documenting edge cases in the MCP specification that require custom solutions, with Frank continuing to refine design boundaries as implementation reveals gaps.

**Strategic Challenges**

The sequencing of new tool requests against gateway development requires careful coordination. While the gateway won\'t be production-ready until mid-December with tool refactoring extending into January, there\'s a temporary path available through the existing wrapper Zheng created for immediate high-priority needs. Rowan and Vinod are establishing clear criteria for fast-lane requests versus waiting for the proper gateway implementation to avoid creating technical debt through parallel approaches.

Holiday coverage presents resource constraints with significant team time off planned between Christmas and New Year\'s. Carter is out the entire week of Christmas through January 2nd, Topher is out the Christmas week, and other team members have scattered time off. Vinod has documented this in a shared calendar and is adjusting milestone planning to account for reduced capacity during this period.

The definition and scope of \"context service\" requires clarification across stakeholders. What began as tenant and user context retrieval has expanded to potentially include scoring, recommendations, and other API endpoints. A confluence document is needed to align understanding of what belongs in context service versus the gateway, and how these capabilities should be packaged for consumers.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The control plane implementation revealed that close coordination between Carter\'s metadata management work and Zheng\'s request routing logic will be essential. The routing decisions depend heavily on information derived from the control plane, suggesting these components should be developed in tight collaboration rather than as separate parallel efforts. This architectural coupling was less obvious during initial design but becomes clear during implementation.

The team validated that the temporary wrapper approach for urgent tool requests remains viable while gateway development continues. This creates flexibility to accommodate high-value customer demands without derailing the proper architecture work. However, establishing clear criteria for when to use this fast lane versus waiting for gateway completion will prevent scope creep and technical debt accumulation.

The existing lookalike account models and contact recommendation capabilities from the data science team are now ready for tool integration. These represent relatively straightforward additions that can be packaged as standalone tool calls, though the best design pattern for combining similar functions (like \"find similar\" versus \"find top\") within a single tool interface remains an open question to explore once the gateway is operational.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Collaboration with the data science team on the lookalike models and contact recommendations is progressing well, with APIs already built that can be adapted into MCP tools. Robin is coordinating a mid-next-week meeting to align on implementation details and integration approach for getting these capabilities into the gateway framework.

The Platform team and Ali require alignment on which existing API endpoints should be incorporated into the gateway offering and in what timeframe. Some endpoints are clear additions while others remain open questions. This broader roadmap discussion will clarify the full scope of the gateway as a unified interface for ZoomInfo\'s AI capabilities.

DevOps partnership is active for infrastructure setup, particularly around API key management and production environment configuration. This technical coordination is happening in parallel with development to ensure deployment readiness when the gateway reaches feature complete status.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s focus centers on advancing request routing implementation and control plane refinement. Zheng will create an MCP server to handle external requests and route them to downstream MCP servers, working closely with Carter as the routing logic leverages control plane metadata. Testing the OAuth flow with Claude represents another critical milestone to validate the authentication layer under realistic conditions.

The team will participate in the scoring and recommendation integration discussion mid-week to align on how those capabilities map to the gateway architecture. This meeting should clarify whether scoring belongs in the context service or as a search service enhancement, and establish the implementation path for lookalike and recommendation tools.

Holiday planning adjustments will continue as the team accounts for December\'s reduced capacity when setting milestone commitments. The current trajectory maintains mid-December gateway availability with January focused on refactoring existing tools into the new architecture, but this timeline factors in the Christmas break constraints documented this week.

## **Semantic Data Team Weekly Report - October 27-31, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team addressed immediate technical and resource constraints to enable ZoomInfo tenant scaling. Danny identified that current 365-day retention costs exceed the allocated \$10K monthly budget and developed a whitelist-mode ingestion approach that will enable processing 100K accounts without the 5x time penalty. Jon is on track to complete GTM Store integration within one week, contingent on three uninterrupted mornings. Matt\'s departure creates knowledge transfer gaps in batch embeddings, requiring careful orchestration of backfill runs until Jon completes the handoff.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Danny architected a solution to the account scaling challenge by switching from segmented API calls (200 accounts per request) to whitelist-mode processing. This approach eliminates the linear time penalty that would have made the jump from 20K to 100K accounts infeasible---previously tracking at 5x the processing time. The change enables deployment of the ZoomInfo tenant within the next week rather than requiring extensive infrastructure redesign.

Jon maintained progress on the GTM Store and Jest integration despite ongoing support demands. The work will dramatically accelerate ingest pipeline performance once deployed, reducing what currently takes 2-2.5 hours for the ingest step alone. He\'s targeting completion by end of next week, requiring roughly three focused morning blocks to finish the implementation.

The team identified a critical path dependency on ZDP team coordination for vector store append mode. Danny has active PRs ready for testing and expects 1-2 days for release testing and iteration once the right contacts are established. The person he\'d been working with is departing next Friday, creating urgency around finding the appropriate handoff within that organization.

**Goals & Progress**

**Ingest Pipeline Optimization:** Danny is implementing the whitelist-mode ingestion change today to enable the ZoomInfo tenant run at scale. The current method becomes unworkable at 100K accounts (5x time increase from the 20K baseline), but the new approach queries all calls from the Chorus API and filters locally rather than sending 200-account batches. This preserves the existing account list validation while eliminating the API request bottleneck. A secondary benefit is positioning the team to potentially remove account filtering entirely and validate against account_id fields in Chorus data directly.

**GTM Store Integration:** Jon estimates one week to complete the migration work, assuming he can secure three consecutive quiet mornings without support interruptions. The migration will eliminate the 2-2.5 hour ingest bottleneck currently constraining the pipeline. Progress depends on code review support from Danny through Thursday (his last day with access) and the new team members coming up to speed on the review process.

**Vector Store Append Mode:** The ZDP team integration requires merging Danny\'s PR to enable append mode rather than full rewrites. Current estimate is 1-2 days for release testing and potential iteration once the right contacts are identified. Team restructuring at ZDP has complicated handoffs---the previous point of contact departs next Friday. Once merged, the team can adjust Airflow cadence to enable continuous ingestion rather than batch processing.

**Strategic Challenges**

The 365-day requirement collides with current budget allocation. Initial setup was \$10K monthly, but 365-day for the expanded tenant scope significantly exceeds this threshold. Danny is working with Arkady to clarify budget expectations and will coordinate with Tal on realistic allocations. The team can execute 90-day retention within budget, but that requires code changes to optimize the ingestion method---work Danny is implementing today. The delta between 90-day and 365-day retention carries substantial cost implications that need executive-level decision-making.

Matt\'s departure next week creates immediate knowledge gaps in batch embeddings implementation. While he explored the approach, the work never reached production. This leaves the team managing token limits manually---ongoing runs burst-call for embeddings, and any backfill runs compete for the same token allocation, causing throttling and errors. Without batch embeddings, backfills require pausing ongoing runs to prevent conflicts. Jon scheduled knowledge transfer this afternoon and expects Matt will remain available via Slack next week, but the handoff will require several days for Jon to reach working proficiency.

Cross-functional dependencies with the ZDP team introduce timing risk for the vector store work. Team upheaval there has disrupted established communication channels. Danny needs to identify the right contacts and shepherd the PR through testing before his access terminates Thursday. The work itself is straightforward (1-2 days testing and iteration), but organizational uncertainty could extend timelines if handoffs aren\'t completed quickly.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The whitelist-mode ingestion approach surfaced an architectural option the team hadn\'t fully explored---eliminating account filtering at the API level entirely. Rather than providing Chorus with account lists upfront, the team could ingest all calls and validate against account_id fields in the raw data. This would simplify the pipeline and potentially improve performance for continuous ingestion scenarios, though it requires validating that account_id population is reliable in Chorus data. The discovery came from confronting the 100K account scaling problem, where the constraints of the current approach became untenable.

Retention period decisions cascade through both cost structure and technical architecture in ways that aren\'t immediately obvious. The 365-day vs 90-day choice doesn\'t just affect storage costs---it fundamentally changes ingestion volume (5x account increase) and processing approach (necessitating the whitelist-mode change). These decisions require coordinated planning across budget allocation, technical implementation, and product requirements rather than being treated as independent variables. The \$10K monthly budget was set without full consideration of these interdependencies.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The ZDP team collaboration requires immediate attention given personnel transitions on their side and Danny\'s departure Thursday. The vector store append mode PR is critical path for enabling continuous ingestion, and current organizational flux there creates execution risk. The team needs executive assistance identifying the right technical contacts and ensuring the work gets prioritized appropriately during their transition period. This isn\'t a capability gap---it\'s a coordination and ownership clarity issue during a period of concurrent team changes.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on completing the technical foundation for ZoomInfo tenant deployment while managing knowledge transfer from Matt\'s departure. Danny will implement the whitelist-mode ingestion change today, enabling the scale-up to 100K accounts. Jon targets completing GTM Store integration by week\'s end, which eliminates the primary ingest bottleneck. The team needs to secure ZDP collaboration on vector store append mode before Danny\'s access terminates Thursday.

Jon takes ownership of the batch embeddings work Matt initiated, beginning with this afternoon\'s knowledge transfer session. The team will manage token limits manually until that capability ships, requiring careful orchestration between ongoing and backfill runs to prevent throttling. This introduces operational overhead but doesn\'t block progress---it\'s a constraint to manage rather than a blocker.

Budget clarification discussions with Arkady and Tal will determine whether 365-day retention proceeds or if the team pivots to 90-day implementation. Either path is technically feasible given today\'s ingestion changes, but the decision affects downstream planning and resource allocation. The team is positioned to execute quickly once direction is established.

## **Core Data Team Weekly Report - Week of 10/27-10/31**

**Executive Summary**

Concerns emerged around GTM Store implementation for Core Company and Contact with John Durst escalating that no architectural review had occurred with the data engineering team - the discovery that data teams must push to GTM Store rather than allowing consumption from sources represents a fundamental architecture change requiring entire service builds without allocated resources. Resource allocation tensions intensified as Leadership/board of directors work pulled data science resources from Cam Fortin\'s industry model refinement, but after further discussion was mitigated with some resource allocation likely near end of Q4 and overall industry rollout not likely until April to avoid large territory impact changes for customers. However, Cam discovered the December 31 GTM Store deadline is \"not as hard\" as originally believed, providing a runway to \"do it right\" with proper architecture. Heather Ma completed the benchmark agent production roadmap and initiated technical review cycles, while contributory network infrastructure planning shifted toward establishing business value alignment before pursuing engineering resource discussions.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Peter Overman made progress across multiple active initiatives, including (i) crawling started on the 129MM deduplicated domains, (ii) 650K parked domains identified or 3.3% of total processed so far (in-line with 2-4% estimate), (iii) the first weekly batch of partial contributory records processed (expected +4MM net new contacts and +12MM publishable contacts once fully run) and (iv) a successful product kick-off for leadership page identification and extraction. On GTM store, the team made significant progress on Form 5500 with new entityCollections added and encouraging match rate results, while re-normalized job post addresses are significantly improved (backfill expected to complete this weekend).

Hayden Cowell successfully socialized Q3 work through the sprint demo with strong engagement from both Data Tools and DQM teams. Meetings were scheduled with Brandon Derbin and Beth Bruner to discuss the data explainability tool, though these discussions are pending. The transparency metrics work continued with integration planning around consolidating source variations.

Rituparna Das completed evangelization of social location changes, securing enthusiasm from the DaaS team who were excited about accuracy improvements. International expansion research produced a prioritized country list based on demand analysis, while email deliverability discussions advanced with legal and Clickagy teams regarding data utilization and clarification of email generation strategy. Magnus Herweyer completed the H1 2026 NeverBounce roadmap that will address our ability to more accurately validate emails internally for our PTI pipeline, and external customers like NeverBounce.com.

**Goals & Progress**

**Strategic Roadmap Adjustments:** Cam Fortin successfully pivoted Q4 roadmap based on resource constraints, establishing a \"Keep Improvements Rolling\" framework to maintain data quality momentum while engineering builds foundational infrastructure. Industry model and employee growth model updates were likely pushed to Q1 2026 due to data science resource reallocation. Location ingestion strategy fundamentally changed from automated pipeline to Analysis-driven table updates, with automation deferred to 2026.

**Board of Directors Product Definition:** Jody Roberts worked with the team to document current and future state of Board of Directors/Leadership data to define a standalone offering. This clarification aims to enable sales to focus on supportable opportunities and move away from manual research-driven approaches. Multiple vendor conversations advanced with Stirista, Uncast, and Predactiv for new data opportunities.

Heather Ma completed the 100-day production roadmap for the benchmark agent, currently pending first round review with the Agentic platform team followed by GTM Store team review. After technical alignment, the plan will be presented to DAI for evaluation before moving to engineering resource discussions. On contributory network infrastructure, Heather shifted focus based on product leadership feedback to prioritize stakeholder alignment on business rationale and impact before pursuing engineering resource conversations.

**Strategic Challenges**

GTM Store integration complexity became clearer with John Durst\'s escalation about missing architectural reviews two months from launch. The fundamental change from data consumption to push services wasn\'t communicated to data owners, creating unplanned work. However, Cam\'s discovery that the December 31 deadline isn\'t as rigid as believed provides breathing room, with a \"shim\" solution in place while proper architecture is developed.

Resource reallocation created cascading impacts across multiple initiatives. The single data science resource supporting company initiatives was pulled to board of directors work, forcing both industry model and employee growth model delays to Q1 2026. Cam noted frustration that the industry model was ready for refinement but couldn\'t release without resources, though he\'s exploring phased rollout options if Analysis can clear portions.

Shared services dependencies intensified after alignment with AI Data Management; Magnus highlighted that AI Data Management now depends on shared services for GTM Studio feature releases as a result of both teams working together to deliver AI Data Management\'s vision. The part-time resource model of Shared Services is insufficient when shared services could block studio releases due to an inability to hit deadlines, make time for cross functional meetings - an issue raised for three months without resolution despite the hiring freeze.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

A principal UX researcher (Vibhore) unexpectedly reached out to Peter about the data quality survey, agreeing to drive it using Peter\'s survey as a starting point. This collaboration will result in a joint presentation to Data leadership, addressing long-standing needs for systematic customer requirements understanding at minimal cost.

Adam Peretz completed API versioning proposal and identified pathways for MCP credit estimation, while navigating complex partnership discussions with Salesforce around agentic data access and AWS around marketplace integration. Marc Frail exceeded data connector goals, building 22 connectors versus the target of 8, though publishing flow requires MVE and UNIE integration rationalization. The Salesforce partnership presents both significant revenue opportunity and substantial technical and legal complexity requiring executive attention.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Marc Frail dramatically exceeded data connector library goals, building 22 connectors for GTM Studio GA versus the original target of 8. This foundational work positions enrichment capabilities as a cornerstone of GTM Studio success, though final publishing flow testing with Andres\'s team awaits completion.

Adam Peretz delivered comprehensive API versioning framework, completing a proposal ready for Monday\'s leadership review that recommends maintaining three versions of every endpoint: Legacy, Stable, and Preview. The systematic approach addresses longstanding frustration from both customers and engineering teams around API evolution management.

Salesforce agentic partnership opportunity surfaces with aggressive timelines, as Adam Peretz engaged with Salesforce following Ali\'s Dreamforce discussions about agent data access. The partnership could enable Salesforce to sell ZoomInfo access to their customers, leveraging an existing but unused agreement while requiring careful navigation of technical, legal, and financial considerations.

**Goals & Progress**

**API Infrastructure Advancement:** Adam Peretz completed both weekly goals, delivering versioning proposal and reviewing credit estimation options across relevant teams. The stateless MCP architecture prevents immediate credit estimation, but future stateful server functionality will enable user solicitation and configurable threshold management.

**Data Connector Ecosystem Expansion:** Marc Frail exceeded goals by 275%, delivering 22 connectors ready for GTM Studio GA pending final publishing flow validation. The library establishes broad integration coverage, with future iterations focusing on customer-driven prioritization and refinement.

**Strategic Challenges**

Salesforce partnership timeline creates resource pressure, with end-of-November target for buildable functionality requiring minimal changes achievable in one sprint. More complex requirements like contact data credit bypassing would need additional engineering resources and represent implementation risk requiring new entitlements and careful security controls.

Salesforce partnership requires extensive cross-functional coordination, involving legal terms review, potentially new contracting, financial agreement validation, and careful consideration of data misuse liability. Adam Peretz noted that approval and planning complexity may exceed the engineering implementation challenges.

AWS partnership opportunity adds parallel complexity, with Amazon building custom agent tools for HP and seeking marketplace integration paths for selling ZoomInfo products. This second major partnership discussion creates additional strategic opportunity while demanding coordinated evaluation and execution.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Stateful server evolution enables future MCP capabilities, with Adam Peretz identifying that credit estimation and user solicitation become feasible once MCP moves beyond current stateless architecture. The \"Records Under Management\" feature in search APIs provides a foundation for configurable threshold management with admin-defined warnings or hard stops.

Major partnerships require architectural flexibility around credit charging, as Salesforce\'s agent browsing use case reveals need for credit-free data exploration with charges only on final user presentation. The requirement surfaces architectural assumptions about when and how credit consumption occurs in data access workflows.

Data connector velocity demonstrates platform maturity, as Marc Frail\'s ability to build 22 connectors quickly suggests the connector framework has reached production-ready scalability.

DoubleO team integration continues productive collaboration, with Marc Frail noting a constructive meeting around integration consumption, use cases, business logic, and inventory. The ongoing alignment suggests healthy cross-team coordination on GTM Studio capabilities.

The convergence of major partnership opportunities, API infrastructure maturation, and data connector ecosystem expansion creates significant platform momentum, but success requires careful management of partnership complexity, resource constraints, and architectural evolution challenges.

## **Integrations Team Weekly Report - October 27, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Prateek Paikray successfully released the new Agentforce managed package with entitlement tracking and completed Data Catalog UI integration with the Global Dataset API, while organic customer interest from Flex.com, Uber for Business, and FedEx validates market demand for the ZI Revenue Agent. Sanyog Rai\'s systematic validation of engagements use cases is identifying GraphQL and GTM Store issues before they impact downstream teams, creating a quality gate that ensures platform reliability. Erica Fienman\'s roadmap continued to execute with CRM importing every one hour for all GTM DM tenants, and GTM DM backfill at 100% complete. Andres Perez built foundational Auth-MS infrastructure within the Agentic Platform that unblocks future vendor tool development and enables the Auto-Custom-Field Agent to access user tokens and CRM configurations.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Sanyog Rai is validating engagements use cases for downstream teams by systematically reviewing queries against actual platform capabilities. His methodology of confirming queries through hands-on testing is uncovering actionable issues with GraphQL and the GTM Store that would have impacted teams relying on these capabilities, and the team has already prioritized fixes based on his findings.

Prateek Paikray delivered the new Agentforce managed package with entitlement tracking capabilities and successfully demoed the solution to Engine and Salesforce teams to onboard Flex.com as a customer. He held internal discussions with Account Management for Uber for Business and FedEx to position Agentforce for their specific use cases, demonstrating how organic inbound interest from mutual Salesforce customers validates the market demand for agentic solutions and creates opportunities for deeper collaboration.

Andres Perez built a reusable Auth-MS client within the Agentic Platform that provides a standardized way for vendor tools to access user tokens and connected integrations. This infrastructure work solves a longstanding limitation that prevented building certain vendor tools in the past, and his Auto-Custom-Field Agent can now create custom fields on GTM Objects, retrieve field mappings between GTM and vendor objects, and access Salesforce page layout information using authenticated user tokens.

**Goals & Progress**

**GTM Platform Vertical Datasets:** Prateek Paikray completed integration of the Data Catalog UI with the new Global Dataset API developed by the GTM Store team, enabling unified data preview functionality across both internal and external marketplaces. He also initiated Q4 planning with the Engineering team for multi-instance CRM ingestion, which will allow customers to create workbooks directly from CRM data across multiple instances of the same CRM system. His collaboration with Lars and the Platform team defined the integration approach between Agentforce and the ZoomInfo Agentic Platform to enable unified Copilot Chat experiences within Salesforce.

**GTM Platform:** Sanyog Rai is working through priority engagements use cases for downstream teams to validate what the platform can and cannot currently support. His approach of reviewing use cases and confirming queries has proven effective at identifying platform gaps early, allowing the team to understand limitations and prioritize work to address them before downstream teams encounter issues in production environments.

**GTM Studio:** Andres Perez made substantial progress on the Auto-Custom-Field Agent within the Agentic Platform, successfully implementing six core capabilities including creating custom fields on GTM Objects, retrieving current fields and field mappings, updating mappings between GTM and vendor objects, and accessing Salesforce page layout fields using authenticated user tokens. When the team identified that the Agentic Platform lacked a standard mechanism for accessing user tokens and integrations, they made the strategic decision to build the Auth-MS client as foundational infrastructure. This work reduces the burden on GTM Admins and enables self-service field configuration that will accelerate GTM Studio adoption.

**Strategic Challenges**

Prateek Paikray identified a dataset attribute standardization gap in the GTM Store where different datasets use inconsistent naming conventions (for example, \"creditorzicompanyid\" in LoanStatements versus \"zoominfo_company_id\" in GTM Account dataset). This lack of standardization increases the development effort required to train Agentforce and other AI agents consistently across datasets, creating technical debt that will compound as more vertical datasets are added. Establishing governance standards or abstraction layers could significantly reduce ongoing integration complexity and accelerate agent training across the platform.

Andres Perez encountered authentication issues when attempting to upgrade the Auth-MS client within the Agentic Platform to retrieve the CRM user for import connections. The API swagger documentation isn\'t providing clear authentication guidance, which has led to a planned session with Ilan on Monday to resolve the technical approach. Once this authentication pattern is established, the Agentic Platform will have a repeatable pattern for accessing user tokens that can be applied to expanding CRM coverage beyond Salesforce to HubSpot and Microsoft Dynamics.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Sanyog Rai discovered that methodically reviewing engagements use cases against actual GraphQL queries is an effective quality assurance mechanism for the GTM Store. This approach catches platform issues before they impact downstream teams and provides concrete prioritization data about which limitations matter most for real-world use cases. The pattern of validating platform capabilities through actual use case testing could be applied to other platform validation efforts to improve release quality and reduce downstream friction.

Prateek Paikray observed growing organic interest in the ZoomInfo Revenue Agent from mutual Salesforce customers, indicating strong market validation for the Agentforce solution. This inbound demand from enterprise customers like Flex.com, Uber for Business, and FedEx suggests the solution is addressing real pain points and creates leverage for expanding the partnership with Salesforce beyond initial accounts. The pattern of interest from large enterprise customers indicates the agentic approach scales to complex use cases and positions ZoomInfo as a strategic Salesforce partner.

Andres Perez\'s work on the Agentic Platform revealed that the platform lacked a unified way to access user tokens and integration configurations, which explained why certain vendor tools had been challenging to build in previous attempts. Rather than creating one-off solutions for the Auto-Custom-Field Agent, the team made the strategic decision to build proper infrastructure through the Auth-MS client, with plans to incorporate the new Integration Config Service as the single source of truth for settings and connection status. This architectural improvement will accelerate future agent development across the Agentic Platform and reduce technical debt.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our collaboration with the Engineering team on multi-CRM ingestion and Cloud DataShare for Engagement is advancing with Q4 planning now underway and epics created in JIRA for execution. The work with Lars and the Platform team to define Agentforce integration with the ZoomInfo Agentic Platform is progressing well, with alignment on the technical approach to enable unified Copilot Chat across Salesforce and Slack. Prateek Paikray is coordinating with Rowan\'s team next week to review the MCP tools roadmap and ensure alignment between Agentforce capabilities and the broader Agentic Platform strategy, which will inform how new agentic functionality can extend to Agentforce implementations.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on completing validation work for engagements, demonstrating the vertical dataset experience to stakeholders, and expanding Agentic Platform CRM coverage. The team is positioned to move from infrastructure building and validation to broader platform enablement and customer demonstrations.

Prateek Paikray will conduct end-to-end testing of the Data Catalog from dataset registry through UI discoverability to validate the vertical dataset experience, record a vertical dataset demo for the upcoming GTM Monthly Platform Review to showcase progress and functionality, test the Export to Databricks via Bobsled functionality for Cloud Data Share, and meet with Rowan\'s team to review the MCP tools roadmap and align on how these capabilities can extend to Agentforce. Sanyog Rai will complete his review of priority engagements use cases, providing a clear picture of platform readiness and known limitations for downstream teams. Andres Perez will resolve the Auth-MS authentication approach with Ilan on Monday and then expand the CRM tool within the Agentic Platform to support retrieving page layout fields for HubSpot and Microsoft Dynamics in addition to Salesforce.

The team\'s progress on engagements validation, Agentforce customer traction, and Agentic Platform infrastructure positions us well to accelerate agent capabilities, vertical dataset adoption, and multi-CRM support in the coming weeks.

## **Product BI Team Weekly Report - 10/31/25**

**Executive Summary**

The team achieved a critical milestone this week by launching the first AI-powered self-service analytics agent in the ZIM Slack channel, enabling stakeholders to get instant answers to common questions without BI team intervention. This represents meaningful progress toward scaling our support model. Simultaneously, the Workspace analytics foundation strengthened significantly with the completion of a storytelling-driven adoption dashboard ready for PM self-service ahead of the November 3rd external rollout, while the account health reporting framework advanced through cross-functional alignment on use-case-driven measurement. Next week focuses on expanding Workspace engagement visibility through chatbot integration while the API dashboard work resumes as engineering completes data backfill.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

**AI Agent Self-Service Launch in ZIM Channel:** Successfully deployed the team\'s first AI-powered analytics agent to the ZIM Slack channel, creating a scalable alternative to manual ad-hoc requests. The agent supports two query modes: historical search across past channel conversations for qualitative questions, and auto-query capabilities for time-sensitive quantitative questions like customer counts on Copilot or top Marketing OS spenders by impression/click metrics. Early testing shows strong performance across multiple question types. Stakeholder testing is now underway to collect feedback before expanding to other analytics channels. Created comprehensive documentation for Confluence to support future rollout. This directly reduces the team\'s reactive support burden while improving stakeholder response time from hours to seconds.

**Workspace Adoption Dashboard Redesign for PM Self-Service:** Transformed the Workspace adoption dashboard from a raw data view into a storytelling-driven experience that flows from overall usage to specific feature adoption. The redesigned interface enables PMs and stakeholders to independently understand adoption patterns without BI assistance. User path analysis for AE and AAM segments (the primary target customers) revealed that 40% initiate workspace chat directly from the homepage, 23% navigate to view functionality, and 16% of chat users also engage with views---demonstrating strong multi-feature engagement. Dashboard is production-ready ahead of the November 3rd external user launch, when Workspace becomes available as an Enterprise package upgrade.

**Workspace Account Health Reporting Framework Development:** Established foundational alignment with Mary, Whitney, and Victor on the measurement approach for Copilot Workspace account health reporting. CX will tag each account with a primary use case, creating the structure for use-case-aligned reporting that mirrors how customer success teams actually manage accounts. This user-centric framework ensures reporting matches the mental models of GTM teams rather than imposing technical taxonomies. The approach positions BI to deliver onboarding health metrics and post-onboarding success indicators that directly support account management decisions. Key challenge identified: determining the aggregation logic for rolling up use-case-level metrics into account-level health scores.

**Goals & Progress**

**\[Workspace Account Health Reporting\]:** Use-case framework alignment complete with CX team. Next step requires designing the rollup methodology that aggregates use-case-specific metrics into account-level health indicators for both onboarding and post-onboarding phases. Proposal documentation targeted for next week to establish reporting standards before external accounts launch.

**\[Workspace Analytics & Self-Service\]:** Workspace engagement metrics integration into the internal chatbot progressing with Eran securing necessary database access permissions. Workbook dashboard cleanup prioritized for next week to reduce complexity from current 20-tab structure that creates navigation challenges for stakeholders. On track to deliver comprehensive adoption reporting framework before external launch.

**\[API Usage Dashboard\]:** Paused active development this week while awaiting complete data backfill from engineering, but validated that published data structure contains required fields for dashboard requirements. Resume development next week now that structure review is complete.

**\[AI Agent Expansion\]:** ZIM channel deployment complete and in user testing phase. Pending Slack-Chat integration from AI Chat team before broader rollout---integration will eliminate friction of navigating to external chatbot link by keeping all interaction within Slack. Identified constraint that integration-focused channels cannot be next expansion target due to CDP data dependency (chatbot currently only works with Snowflake data). Next expansion requires selecting a Snowflake-heavy analytics channel.

**\[Marketing OS Churn Analysis\]:** Data foundation established this week despite Ferrell\'s illness reducing capacity. Analysis will quantify churn magnitude and identify contributing factors for product team intervention. Next week continues analysis development and timeline estimation.

**\[Core Engagement Analytics\]:** New requests emerging as additional data becomes available on PM side. Ferrell evaluating data feasibility and effort estimation for upcoming sprint planning.

**Unsolved Blockers & Why**

**Backend Event Instrumentation for Workspace Key Events:** Account health reporting capabilities limited by reliance on frontend (Amplitude) instrumentation only. Backend event logging would enable significantly deeper and more reliable insights into user behavior patterns, particularly for technical actions that may not fire frontend events consistently. R&D timeline for creating backend data tables currently targets early December, which creates a measurement gap during the critical initial onboarding period for external accounts. Risk: May need to retrofit reporting logic once backend data becomes available.

**Slack-Chat Integration Timing:** Full AI agent rollout to additional channels blocked pending completion of Slack-Chat sync from AI Chat team. Current workflow requires users to click external link to access chatbot, creating friction that reduces adoption likelihood. Integration will enable seamless question-asking directly in Slack channels. Nanxi coordinating with AJ on timing for broader rollout once integration completes. Workaround identified: can begin expansion to Snowflake-focused channels while integration completes.

**CDP Data Access for Integration Channels:** Cannot deploy AI agent to integration-focused analytics channels because their data resides in CDP, which the chatbot doesn\'t currently support. This eliminates several high-value expansion candidates. No immediate workaround; requires either chatbot CDP connectivity or data pipeline changes.

**CRM Data Source Migration Complexity:** Import data transfer from legacy to new CRM source encountering unexpected technical complexity, requiring iterative problem-solving with CDP team. Delays may cascade to downstream analytics that depend on this data. Migration scope proving larger than initial assessment. Ferrell working with CDP team to resolve.

**Limited Access to Airtable and Jenkins:** Eran\'s limited access to Airtable and Jenkins causing minor dependencies on the Data team for certain development tasks, though not currently blocking major deliverables.

**Key Learnings This Week**

Learned that effective AI agent performance requires sophisticated prompt engineering tailored to different question types---adjusting phrasing and context logic differently for historical retrieval versus real-time quantitative queries significantly improved accuracy. Nanxi documented these patterns for future channel expansions. The agent\'s ability to handle time-sensitive spending analysis questions (e.g., \"who spent the most in the last 7 days\") demonstrates particular value for questions that previously required lengthy manual analysis.

User behavior data revealed unexpected insight about Workspace adoption patterns: the strong crossover between chat and view usage (16% of chat users also engage with views) suggests these features create complementary value rather than competing for attention. After landing on the homepage, most AE and AAM users either initiate a chat (40%) or open a view (23%), showing that these are the primary entry points. This finding should inform product prioritization and marketing messaging for the November 3rd external launch.

Dashboard complexity threshold identified: 20-tab workbooks overwhelm stakeholders and defeat self-service goals regardless of data quality. Phoebe prioritizing ruthless scope reduction for the Workbook cleanup to create clearer information architecture. Future dashboard design should address navigation challenges during initial build rather than post-launch.

CX team\'s use-case framework for managing Workspace accounts provides a valuable blueprint for structuring analytics---aligning reporting to customer-facing use cases rather than technical feature taxonomies creates more actionable insights for GTM teams. This user-centric approach should inform future reporting design across other products.

Eran learned to work more independently withGit, DBT, and semantic models---tools that clearly represent the future of analytics and data delivery at the company. This technical upskilling reduces dependencies and improves team agility.

**Scene Set Next Week**

AJ Belen: Document proposal for use-case-level to account-level health metric rollup methodology, establishing the reporting framework for both onboarding and post-onboarding phases. Socialize approach with Mary, Whitney, and Victor to validate it supports their account management workflows before external Workspace accounts launch.

Phoebe Mei: Push Workspace engagement metrics into internal chatbot for real-time querying, enabling stakeholders to ask adoption questions conversationally. Execute Workbook dashboard cleanup to reduce complexity and improve self-service experience. Collaborate with Eran on database access provisioning and front-end event instrumentation requests for PM and engineering teams.

Nanxi Ge: Resume API dashboard development now that data structure validation is complete, building query framework and establishing core visualizations. Finalize AI agent documentation upload to Confluence and continue collecting stakeholder feedback from ZIM channel testing. Coordinate with engineering on data backfill timeline.

Ferrell: Continue Marketing OS churn analysis development, moving from data foundation to identifying churn patterns and quantifying impact for product team. Directly test churn analysis ideas targeting the approximately 783 customers affected. Evaluate feasibility and timeline for new Core engagement analytics requests. Discuss and prioritize integration engagement import metric development with stakeholders, including identifying which fields from new GTM tables should be used in Core Engagement tables.

Eran Dayan: Complete Workspace Utilization table for chatbot integration, finishing database access setup. Focus on productionizing the utilization semantic model and validating chatbot accuracy for utilization-related questions.

## **Product Operations Team Weekly Report - October 27, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Brett Jacobs identified a flaw in how the company has approached release automation: downstream teams are still manually summarizing AI-generated content the same way they did before, just faster. The feature info packs contain rich information and use AI, but enablement, customer success, and field teams take that output and summarize it again for their audiences - building \"a better typewriter instead of a computer\" as Brett described it. This realization came as Kristin Gandini and Sam Darcy brought both the VOC tool and Agent Builder to launch-ready state, and Ken Elwell moved the workspace changelog to near-final status. The team now has clarity on priorities through Brett\'s focus document, with VOC rollout and knowledge management taking center stage while mid-tier initiatives move to maintenance mode.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Brett clarified strategic priorities across the team through a focus document that emphasizes getting the VOC tool launched and establishing regular cadences, primarily driven by Kristin Gandini and Sam Darcy. The middle initiatives are effectively deprioritized or moved to maintenance mode, creating clarity on where the team invests energy. For Ken, the focus is pushing forward the launch assets and release process work. For Daniel Kong, it\'s closing the knowledge loop so that foundational information exists, end assets are ready, and questions get answered efficiently for GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace.

Ken Elwell moved the workspace changelog significantly closer to final and initiated the GTM Studio release tracking work. The key insight from the week is that sending changelogs out to the GTM team feels like the wrong use case - there isn\'t real demand for it. The higher-value application is automating release tracking as an input to other workflows, particularly the MCR process. The release notes site at gtm.ai/release-notes is live, with zoominfo.com tracking toward November 18.

Kristin Gandini has both the VOC tool and the Agent Builder for prototyping ready to roll out, with the Agent Builder held up only by a final PR approval. The challenge now is sequencing these launches effectively without overwhelming PM teams, especially with planning season approaching. The Agent Builder enables rapid prototyping of new agents, while the VOC tool needs to expand beyond just the initial use cases into regular workflows and rituals for tracking progress on top customer issues.

**Goals & Progress**

**Release Process Automation:** Brett and Ken worked through technical requirements for getting PR data from Dan and Guy\'s system. The ideal state is having saved filters for Copilot Workspace and GTM Studio that automatically populate with PR descriptions and associated Jira tickets, exportable to CSV on demand. This avoids relying on the engineering team to run and maintain prompts, giving the Product Ops team control over tuning the changelog generation process. Guy suggested they could automate the LLM output on the backend, but Brett rejected this approach because the prompt will need too much tuning over time and shouldn\'t be dependent on engineering resources. The solution is either a saved search that updates as PRs come in, or a weekly batch process that generates the data for export.

**Strategic Release Vision:** Brett articulated the \"driverless carriage\" problem with current release processes - the team has feature info packs with rich information and uses AI to generate summaries, which is faster than before. But downstream teams (enablement, customer success, field) still consume it the same way by manually summarizing and redistributing it. This is like building a better typewriter when computers exist. The breakthrough is recognizing that products like GTM Studio and Workspace enable mass personalization, which is exactly what release communications need. Brett proposed running release information through these products to blend it with account intelligence, but acknowledged this is primarily product question marks that need discovery work.

**Voice of Customer Infrastructure:** Brett nearly completed the VOC analysis for the 2026 roadmap but ran out of Claude credits before finishing. Kristin and Sam are preparing to roll out the VOC tool to PM teams, but need to think through positioning and timing carefully. There\'s a dual challenge: shipping the initial tool with core use cases, and establishing the second layer of workflows and rituals around how teams will use VOC on a regular cadence to track progress on top issues and drive action. The rollout strategy needs to avoid overwhelming PMs while ensuring each capability gets proper attention and adoption.

**Knowledge Management:** The Docket knowledge base is currently a \"shitshow\" according to both Brett and Ken, with people dumping unstructured content including poorly transcribed meeting recordings. Ken gained access and cleaned up bad documents. Daniel Kong needs to focus heavily on closing the knowledge loop when he returns - establishing clear processes for how questions come in, how the team supports sellers, and how to create new assets from existing foundational information. The pieces exist but need systematic organization for GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace pods.

**Strategic Challenges**

The automated release tech meeting on Tuesday has become complicated with multiple stakeholders and confusion about two different tools being discussed. Emmy and Josh added Emily from enablement plus other people to a meeting that was meant to align on technical requirements. Kristin plans to clearly delineate which tool is ready for enablement handoff (the CX-focused one) versus which one Ken is working on, since Dan and Guy keep getting confused about where one ends and the other begins. Brett suggested potentially repurposing that meeting time for the release changelog work after the CX tool discussion wraps.

The knowledge management situation with Docket represents a broader challenge around too many cooks in the kitchen without clear ownership or standards. People are uploading random content without structure, making it difficult for the chatbot and other tools to surface relevant information. The team has all the necessary pieces - knowledge bases are set up, exploration with Docket is done, conversations with specific teams have happened - but there isn\'t a systematic process that Daniel can enforce for the GTM Studio and Workspace domains. This becomes more critical as the chatbot potentially replaces Docket within the next 6 months.

Product Management Ops ownership of the release process isn\'t clearly established. Brett identified that PMOs should be the anchor point for holistically saying what shipped for a given product universe, but they don\'t totally know currently and are asking to be included in meetings. The PMs need to define how releases should be structured, but there\'s ambiguity about who ultimately owns the changelog and how it gets maintained. This creates coordination challenges as the team tries to automate more of the process.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Brett\'s realization about the \"driverless carriage\" problem fundamentally reframed the release work. The team has most of the information in feature info packs and is using AI to generate summaries, which is faster than before. But downstream teams still consume it the same way - by manually summarizing and redistributing it. This is like building a better typewriter when computers exist. The breakthrough insight is that products like GTM Studio and Workspace enable mass personalization, which is exactly what release communications need. Instead of one-size-fits-all summaries, the team should explore whether these products can blend release information with account intelligence so field teams see only what\'s relevant to their specific accounts.

The PMO anchor point insight clarifies ownership questions that have been creating coordination overhead. If PMOs are responsible for holistically tracking what shipped in their product domain, then they should be the primary consumer and validator of automated changelogs. This gives the team a clear stakeholder to work with on structure and content rather than trying to serve too many audiences simultaneously. The challenge is that PMOs don\'t currently have full visibility, which is why they\'re requesting inclusion in various meetings.

Kristin\'s observation about the dual nature of the VOC rollout is important for preventing failure. The team can\'t just ship a tool and expect adoption - they need to establish workflows and rituals around how PMs will use it regularly to track progress and drive action. This is the difference between a demo that impresses and a capability that changes behavior. The sequencing and positioning of the rollout needs to account for both the initial \"here\'s what it can do\" launch and the ongoing \"here\'s how you integrate it into your work\" adoption process.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The automated release work depends heavily on Dan and Guy\'s engineering team delivering the right data structure in an exportable format. Brett is very clear that the Product Ops team cannot rely on engineering to run and maintain prompts for changelog generation - they need raw data they can process themselves. This means getting agreement on saved filters or batch processes that populate PR descriptions and Jira ticket associations for Copilot Workspace and GTM Studio separately.

Kristin\'s VOC and Agent Builder rollouts need careful coordination with planning timelines and PM capacity. Launching powerful new tools right as teams enter planning season could either be perfect timing or create overload. The team needs to think through not just the tools themselves but how PMs will incorporate them into planning workflows versus ongoing product development rhythms. The Tuesday automated release tech meeting has become crowded with enablement and other stakeholders, requiring clear communication about which tool is ready for handoff versus still in development.

**Looking Ahead**

Brett\'s immediate priority is finishing the VOC analysis for the 2026 roadmap, assuming he can get more Claude credits. This foundational work needs to close out so Kristin and Sam can roll out the VOC tool to PM teams next week. The rollout strategy needs to address both the initial tool capabilities and the ongoing workflows and rituals for how teams will use it regularly.

Ken\'s focus shifts to discovery work on whether GTM Studio and Workspace can actually deliver on personalized release communications. This means trying to run real release data through the product and identifying where it breaks. The concept is piloting with a few CSMs to validate whether the team can blend release information with account intelligence to show field teams only what\'s relevant to their accounts. Daniel Kong will support the changelog work when he returns, as that falls more naturally in his domain of knowledge management.

Kristin needs to finalize the Agent Builder PR approval and determine the best sequencing for rolling out both the Agent Builder and VOC tool without overwhelming PM teams. The automated release tech meeting on Tuesday will be the venue for clearly separating the CX-focused tool (ready for enablement) from the changelog work (still in development), preventing further confusion between Dan, Guy, and the growing list of stakeholders. The team is building toward a future where release planning is automated and personalized, knowledge management is systematic, and PM teams have powerful VOC capabilities embedded in their workflows.

## **Team Provisioning & Login Weekly Report - October 27, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team has successfully achieved full alignment on the AI credit rollout for GTM Studio Early Access (EA) customers and is executing the plan to cut over internal tenants to the AI credit service. Jessie Kain Lindstrom secured sign-off on the narrative, customer materials, and the allocation of 25,000 AI credits for remaining month for GTM Studio EA customers. Brannen Huske, working with relevant teams, has a cutover plan for November 3rd to ensure internal usage of AI credits is tracked for accurate forecasting and usage data. The main strategic challenge is the urgent need to transition to the live AI credit service to gather actual usage data, as current estimates and modeling are proving insufficient for accurate planning.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Jessie Kain Lindstrom achieved a significant win by getting sign-off on the number of AI credits and the final narrative for GTM Studio EA customers, completing all three high-leverage goals for the week. This narrative and supporting materials are now with the design team and ready for the critical Pricing and Packaging meeting on November 4th, moving the GTM motion forward rapidly.

Brannen Huske and the broader team established a clear cutover plan for November 3rd to switch internal tenants to using the AI credit service. This is a crucial step driven by Victor\'s request to understand how the company internally uses AI tools, which is essential for better external projections and gathering real per-person, per-action usage data.

A key technical blocker was addressed by realizing that enabling Copilot Workspace via a feature flag prevented tracking customer usage. The cutover plan to use the dedicated Copilot Workspace license on November 3rd resolves this, enabling the use of our existing analytics framework to accurately monitor customer adoption for Phoebe and the broader team.

**Goals & Progress**

**GTM Studio AI Credit Messaging and Allocation:** Jessie Kain Lindstrom finalized and secured sign-off on the narrative and materials for GTM Studio. GTM Studio EA customers will receive 25,000 credits for the remaining month, a number that aligns with the estimated \$240K annual baseline for the product, allowing the team to monitor usage before the upsell process.

**Internal AI Credit Cutover:** Brannen Huske partnered with GTM Studio, Copilot Workspace, and the TPM org to develop a cutover plan for 11/3 to transition internal tenants to AI credits. This work is essential to gather real usage data---credits used per person, per action---replacing the current reliance on estimates for better projections.

**Workspace License Tracking:** To resolve the inability to track customers using Copilot Workspace due to a feature flag, the team is making the switch to the Copilot Workspace license as part of the 11/3 cutover. This transition will enable the team to leverage existing analytic frameworks to gain visibility into adoption.

**Strategic Challenges**

The primary challenge is the lack of actual production data on AI credit usage, which is making credit forecasting difficult and uncertain. While Jessie Kain Lindstrom has done modeling, the team recognized that the sooner everyone, even internal users, is cut over to the credit service, the faster they can get accurate, real-world data to solidify projections.

A related challenge is the difficulty the Agentic team has had with easily aggregating existing usage data, as it\'s not currently stored in a format conducive to simple analysis. This reinforces the urgency of pushing all users, starting with internal tenants, onto the official AI credit service as the necessary \"consistent way\" to track usage on a per-user basis.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The most significant learning is that reliance on modeling and estimates for AI credit usage creates too much churn and uncertainty. As Jessie Kain Lindstrom noted, the team should have cut everyone over to the credit service when it was ready, even if they weren\'t charging at the time, just to gather the necessary production data.

Brannen Huske reinforced this, highlighting the assumption that the Agentic team could easily \"fudge together\" credit usage data proved incorrect because the data storage was not set up for that level of analysis. This discovery makes the transition to the AI credit service for all users a critical long-term necessity for product planning and forecasting.

The discovery that enabling Copilot Workspace with a feature flag blocked license tracking via analytics was an important finding. This has driven the corrective action to shift to a proper license structure on November 3rd, ensuring the team gains the necessary adoption metrics.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with Pricing and Packaging is essential to finalize the GTM motion. Jessie Kain Lindstrom has a deck ready for the crucial meeting on November 4th, with a dry run scheduled for November 3rd, and is highly confident in the current alignment.

The TPM, GTM Studio, and Copilot Workspace teams are critical partners for Brannen Huske in executing the November 3rd cutover plan. We also rely on Adam Severance (SME from Workspace) and Jagan from GTM Studio Team to ensure a smooth transition for both internal and early access customers.

**Looking Ahead**

The primary focus for the next week is the successful execution of the cutover plan on November 3rd and the subsequent Pricing and Packaging meeting on November 4th.

The top priority is the 11/3 cutover, led by Brannen Huske, to ensure all internal and early access customers are using the AI credit service and the proper Copilot Workspace licenses. This is the only path to gather the real usage data needed to validate models and projections, which will accelerate future product decisions. Following this, Jessie Kain Lindstrom will present the final credit allocation and narrative at the Pricing and Packaging meeting on 11/4.

Moving forward, the key learning for all new feature rollouts is that the AI credit service must be integrated on \"Day one\" of early access. This will establish the foundational data pipeline, even if credits are initially free, and is a vital shift in how we approach our EA programs to enable consistent per-user tracking.
