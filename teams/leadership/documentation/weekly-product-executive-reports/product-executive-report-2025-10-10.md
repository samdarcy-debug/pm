| **Design Resource** **Constraints Blocking Q4 Launches**   | **GTM Studio Team:** Design resource constraints remain a blocker for agentic UX improvements that are essential for November launch. Jagannath needs designer support from Meghan Cartlidge\'s team for two key areas: the AI Data Agent enrichment configuration experience and the full-page Studio Chat experience. Without these resources assigned this week, the team risks shipping agentic capabilities with suboptimal user experience that could impact early adoption. Design team capacity is stretched critically thin across GTM Studio initiatives, with Jagannath blocked on agentic UX improvements and multiple teams waiting for Meghan Cartlidge\'s group to assign resources.                        |

|                                                            | **Intelligence Team:** Ryan McMaster remains the sole UI resource across multiple initiatives, creating a bottleneck Adam flagged for resourcing attention. Ryan McMaster\'s name came up repeatedly during R&D leadership offsite as teams need design support for multiple novel interfaces including Pulses, Workspace layouts, GTM Studio consistency, and DoubleO integration. The team acknowledged they effectively need three of Ryan but will need to prioritize ruthlessly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Engineering Resource Allocation & Capacity Constraints** | **Intelligence Team:** Engineering resource allocation remains the persistent blocker across multiple initiatives. Derek\'s DoubleO work has only one dedicated engineer (Sumont), Robyn\'s roadmap is stalled awaiting clarity on which applications will adopt lookalike MCPs and where UX resources are allocated, and the broader team is stretching across Dreamforce, Copilot stabilization, and H2 planning simultaneously. Leadership acknowledged an approximately 2:1 ratio of roadmap to available PM and engineering capacity. Philip has a goal to complete all engineering resource shifts by end of week to support the locked-down roadmap, with an ask for 11 engineers (including frontend) for DoubleO. |

| **GTM Data Model Gaps & Data Quality Issues**              | **GTM Studio Team:** GTM data model missing historical opportunity data will require to delay picking the ROI GA timeline, currently targeted for mid-December. The platform team discovered certain historical opportunity datasets are absent from GTM Data Model, which would cause pipeline progression metrics to show zeros for many customers. While the data exists in legacy tables, Andres and Asaf\'s teams need to determine how to backfill into new GTM DM tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **GTM Studio (Sneh)**             | **Intelligence Team:** Derek Osgood achieved a breakthrough on DoubleO integration, getting a basic version live in staging with clear path forward: DoubleO becomes the base framework for all workflow capabilities, with workflows components becoming the actions used by agents. The APS integration into Workbooks hit architectural friction that requires redesigning the approach since Workbooks streams data via events without default sorting, creating conflicts with ranked results from APS. |

### **Update on Previous Week Blockers**

**Data processing compliance crisis blocking October 6th customer launch:** No updates provided in this week\'s team reports regarding Langsmith on-premises migration progress. This remains an outstanding issue requiring visibility.

**Concurrency issues threatening multi-user agent platform deployment:** The MCP Team reports significant progress, with Carter completing \"critical concurrency testing showing stable 20-35 second response times under 10 concurrent loads, resolving blocking issues that had been affecting the agent team.\" The team achieved production deployment of the contact research tool with comprehensive observability infrastructure in place.

### **Current Week Update**

**Blockers:**

- **Design resource constraints blocking November 3rd launch readiness:** Multiple teams report critical design bottlenecks. The GTM Studio Team notes \"Design resource constraints are blocking critical agentic UX improvements that are essential for November launch. Jagannath needs designer support from Meghan Cartlidge\'s team for two key areas: the AI Data Agent enrichment configuration experience and the full-page Studio Chat experience. Without these resources assigned this week, the team risks shipping agentic capabilities with suboptimal user experience.\" The Intelligence Team confirms \"Ryan McMaster remains the sole UI resource across multiple initiatives, creating a bottleneck Adam flagged for resourcing attention.\"

- **DoubleO stack adoption forcing comprehensive roadmap reassessment:** The Automation Team reports \"Engineering decision to adopt DoubleO stack over ZoomInfo Workflows forces comprehensive roadmap reassessment. The team completed all weekly goals but faces fundamental strategic shifts,\" requiring \"roadmap reconsideration\" and clarity on \"how triggers and actions will be consumed within the new platform architecture.\"

**Momentum areas:**

- **Dreamforce readiness achieved across all teams with 30+ reps enabled:** The Intelligence Team successfully \"enabled \~30 GTM reps with Context Service access, training materials, and feedback channels\" with \"systems stress-tested and ready.\" The MCP Team \"achieved production deployment this week with comprehensive observability infrastructure in place,\" while multiple teams coordinated to ensure demo stability for the industry\'s premier event.

- **Workspace internal launch delivers strong validation and actionable feedback:** The DAI Team reports \"Workspace stability improvements positioned the team well for Dreamforce demonstrations with go-to-market leaders, though critical regressions required 24-48 hour turnarounds.\" The SalesOS/Copilot Team notes \"Copilot Workspace achieved a major milestone this week with internal Frontline GTM team launch, revealing valuable user feedback that will shape GA readiness,\" particularly around the disconnect between chat and views experiences.

**Bottom line:** Product teams successfully executed Dreamforce readiness while launching Workspace to internal GTM teams, generating critical user feedback that will shape November 3rd GA launch. However, design resource constraints and the DoubleO architectural shift require immediate executive attention to prevent blocking Q4 deliverables across GTM Studio, Copilot, and platform initiatives.

### **GTM Studio**

**GTM Studio Team:** \"The team made critical progress toward November 3rd launch readiness across all core workstreams this week. Jagannath Ramesh and team completed agentic release planning and enablement materials, while Arun V enabled self-serve analytics in Pre-Prod with 5 AMs/CSMs. Ash Lauricella and Corina Soto advanced AI Data Management by kicking off M4/M5 working sessions with engineering and launching Data Health Scan prototype, with strong traction from Strat, Enterprise and Mid-Market leadership teams. Design resource constraints remain a blocker for agentic UX improvements, and GTM data model historical opportunity data gaps could delay ROI GA.\"

### **GTM Copilot Workspace**

**SalesOS/Copilot Team:** \"Copilot Workspace achieved a major milestone this week with internal Frontline GTM team launch, revealing valuable user feedback that will shape GA readiness. The team is addressing a key disconnect between chat and views experiences, with Adam Severance leading foundational improvements to views, chat, and first-time user experience---all design complete with scoping targeted for November 3 release. Gabe Pirela delivered the draft Copilot/Chorus convergence roadmap targeting February customer migrations, establishing a strategic foundation for reducing surface area through agents and artifacts rather than brick-by-brick rebuilding. On ZoomInfo Intent, Harinath Krishnamoorthy completed a functional Cline prototype for Persona-Based Intent in Copilot, ready for Pre-Sales and PM validation sessions that will enable engineering handoff. For Admin Zero Experience, David Goulden finalized enablement packs for Admin-Defined Territories GA (now targeting mid-November), with four additional beta customers onboarded and workflow robustness solutions implemented.\"

### **GTM AI Context Service**

**Intelligence Team:** \"Dreamforce is live next week, and the team successfully enabled \~30 GTM reps with Context Service access, training materials, and feedback channels. While limited rep feedback came through pre-event, systems are stress-tested and ready. Concurrently, the team stabilized Copilot Workspace for high-visibility demos with several critical bug fixes deployed, though a few issues with target accounts, HTML artifacts, and home-to-chat loading remain under investigation. The broader strategic shift is taking shape: custom signals are moving into the plays infrastructure where they belong, and there\'s growing alignment to deprecate the legacy signals/insights layer that\'s accumulating technical debt without delivering proportional value.\"

**Semantic Data Team:** \"Danny Pan\'s team established a clear path from current 24-hour refresh cycles to 1-hour turnaround by the end of next week through ZDP copy append mode implementation. The infrastructure work positions the team to begin GTM store ingestion next week while Jon Seller\'s entity resolution correction script reaches deployment readiness. Resource constraints emerged as a significant headwind, with Christian unavailable for evaluation support and DevOps returning to secondary support status, creating velocity risks that require immediate attention.\"

**MCP Team:** \"The contact research tool achieved production deployment this week with comprehensive observability infrastructure in place. Carter completed critical concurrency testing showing stable 20-35 second response times under 10 concurrent loads, resolving blocking issues that had been affecting the agent team. The team identified two strategic gaps requiring attention before the November gateway launch: GTM store calendar integration needs participant-based meeting lookup (not just creator-based), and all CPA tools require corresponding API endpoints that don\'t yet exist.\"

### **Vertical Datasets**

From **Data Executive Team report:** \"The data organization successfully unblocked user-level Points of Interest (POI) deployment to staging this week, positioning the team to enable enhanced signals across Copilot, Workbooks, and future AI agents. Steve Hutchinson\'s work overcame previous DevOps constraints that had stalled progress for weeks. Simultaneously, Igor Kyrylenko expanded the vertical datasets program by acquiring professional license data from 17 states, establishing the foundation for a comprehensive national licensing database that extends well beyond the original contractor-only focus.\"

Simultaneously, Igor Kyrylenko expanded the vertical datasets program by acquiring professional license data from 17 states, establishing the foundation for a comprehensive national licensing database that extends well beyond the original contractor-only focus.\"

**Core Data Team:** \"Cam Fortin achieved alignment on data drift strategy for the on-demand cube solution (M7.2), securing cross-functional buy-in for a significant technical change that creates incentives for customers to adopt more frequent cube delivery cycles. Magnus Herweyer convened executive leadership including Dominik and Philip to ensure a shared understanding of our email deliverability improvement needs, and will build a comprehensive roadmap addressing critical infrastructure needs that currently limit our ability to publish contacts at scale. Meanwhile, Rituparna Das drove analysis of board of directors data processes, identifying scalable methods to extend this high-value offering beyond Barclays to multiple pending customer requests while discovering previously undocumented infusion methods that will accelerate delivery.\"

### **Other Platform**

**GTM Data Platform Team:** \"The Data Platform team completed critical dependency mapping across GraphQL initiatives and finalized the Q4-2026 roadmap for stakeholder review, establishing the foundation for accelerated delivery on AgentForce, GTM Studio, and Copilot Pro. Linda Johannessen led the stakeholder alignment work, identifying potential bottlenecks before they become execution risks. However, conflicting priority signals across teams threaten to dilute focus---the team cannot simultaneously support January workbooks delivery, federated search integration, schema migrations, and external API release without clear sequencing decisions. Next week centers on locking in agreed priorities and timelines so engineering refinement can proceed with confidence.\"

**Integrations Team:** \"Prateek Paikray delivered full Agentforce functionality, training, and materials for Dreamforce. Sanyog Rai completed a customer self-service frontend prototype for configuring GTM Engagement-sourced Account, Contact, Account Team Role record creation - additionally, 16 tenants are now importing recording data into GTM Meetings (all customers have calendar data already flowing to GTM Meetings). Use case documentation started to ensure all ZI teams comply with new deadline of Jan 31, 2026 to read CRM and Engagement data only from GTM DM via API. Additionally, HPE feedback highlighting features we must introduce into new products around RBAC and Credit charging simplification.\"

**ZIM Team:** \"Forrester Wave demonstration completed showcasing GTM Studio Workbooks audience integration to ZIM while retroactive intent deployment delivers 5,000 monthly custom intent topic capacity. Trade Desk budget exceeds \$3M with potential additional \$3M Q4 spend while October churn reaches 20% requiring attention. Resource reallocation shifts engineers toward agentic platform work affecting Q4 delivery timelines for Beeswax and Connected TV as COIN team transitions to direct Global Event Bus delivery following CDC developer reassignment.\"

**Automation Team:** \"Engineering decision to adopt DoubleO stack over ZoomInfo Workflows forces comprehensive roadmap reassessment. The team completed all weekly goals but faces fundamental strategic shifts. Adam Peretz identified limitations in data analytics capabilities, discovering that the data team no longer has capacity to support pipeline development, forcing workarounds that won\'t scale. Marc Frail delivered a smart builder prototype that raises versioning and packaging questions requiring deeper platform integration investigation.\"

**User Provisioning Team:** \"The Provisioning team achieved successful go-live this week for AI Action Credit usage reporting into SAP, supporting the migration of GTM Studio Early Access (EA) customers and enabling general availability of AI credits. The team is now monitoring the production environment and beginning work to ensure AI usage margin aligns with the 30-40% business target set by leadership.\"

### **Other Operations**

**Product Ops Team:** \"The team made progress this week with Sam Darcy integrating the Voice of Customer tool with the microapp chatbot for easier access and integration with other tools in chat. Simultaneously, Ken Elwell and Daniel Kong made significant progress on the Copilot Workspace content creation system, building out the end-to-end process and agent that will allow product marketers and enablement teams to self-serve content without repeatedly pulling PMs away from building. The team is ready to begin rollout to PMs next week, though we\'ve identified that the knowledge graph\'s traversal logic needs refinement after initial testing showed the simpler agent outperforming the graph-based approach. Caleb Munson has begun structuring the annual planning process with fresh eyes, creating clearer documentation and identifying where we\'ve historically struggled with execution follow-through rather than initial strategy setting.\"

**Product BI Team:** \"The team achieved a significant breakthrough this week on event instrumentation governance. Phoebe Mei secured alignment with Sean and Adam on requiring analytics requirement tickets for every new feature launch, ensuring event tracking is reviewed before features go live. This addresses a longstanding gap where engineering teams shipped features without proper instrumentation. We will need to see events released moving forward actually have the right instrumentation and eventing. Meanwhile, the team is shifting its workspace analysis approach based on insights from session recordings, which revealed that traditional event metrics miss the story of user confusion and unsuccessful attempts - a more valuable signal than raw engagement numbers at this early stage.\"

### **Individual Team Reports**

## **DAI Executive Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Workspace stability improvements positioned the team well for Dreamforce demonstrations with go-to-market leaders, though critical regressions required 24-48 hour turnarounds. The engineering team resolved visibility issues while Victor worked directly with sales leadership to build internal excitement ahead of November 3 rollout. Meanwhile, Studio\'s early access program yielded mixed results: 4 healthy accounts seeing clear value, with 3 additional accounts blocked on activation gaps. The team extended early access through November to leverage planned Workspace integration capabilities.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Victor drove hands-on enablement with 30+ go-to-market leaders through Workspace demo training and all-hands presentations with Tuna and Breyers. Despite encountering critical regressions in chat functionality, the engineering team\'s rapid response demonstrated operational maturity that impressed sales leadership. The message shifted from \"there are still bugs\" to \"we\'re running like a startup within a large company,\" building confidence for the November 3 launch.

Sneh\'s team completed first-draft target account analysis identifying customers with Clay objections, working with Mark\'s team to surface these to account managers. The semantic team, led by Rowan and Danny, compiled engagement data that will inform competitive positioning. While the Clay objection handling content needs refinement, the foundation for November\'s competitive push is in place.

Ali confirmed Salesforce will highlight ZoomInfo in their Sales Cloud keynote at Dreamforce, securing visibility as one of two to three featured software partners. Post-Dreamforce, the teams established a regular cadence to define integration requirements, though Ali is pushing to avoid pigeonholing ZoomInfo as solely a contact provider and wants clear positioning across all datasets.

**Goals & Progress**

**Copilot Workspace Momentum:** Victor\'s team achieved stable, demonstrable product state for internal rollout and Dreamforce presentations. The bread-and-butter demo flow---starting with views, analyzing signals through chat, and prioritizing accounts---resonated strongly. Key quality-of-life improvements shipped this week including view sharing, creating views through chat with ZoomInfo data, and leadership-specific homepage artifacts. However, Ryan McMaster remains the sole UI resource across multiple initiatives, creating a bottleneck Adam flagged for resourcing attention.

**Studio Launch Readiness:** Sneh\'s November launch preparation advanced with the target account list moving from first draft to qualification phase. The team is parsing Clay objections to narrow the account set while preparing enablement content for a dedicated session. The integration milestone for activation via workflows reached detailed design review, with PRD for M2 scheduled this week. Dominik raised concerns about ensuring sellers and SEs understand Studio\'s evolution since May, requesting clarity on the November milestone beyond feature lists.

**Roadmap and Architecture Alignment:** Adam completed interlocks for Pulses, workflows, and related initiatives with Sarah, Sean, and Lars. Steel threads are defined, though marginal cadencing adjustments remain. The key trade-off identified: solving just Pulses by December versus architecting the full async, multi-threaded work pattern. The team is leaning toward a focused December delivery with broader pattern work following. Philip is working through engineering resource gaps, with one scene-setting meeting scheduled for next week.

**Strategic Challenges**

Dataset delivery through Studio faces timeline uncertainty following the onsite decision to deprioritize this work until Q1 federated search implementation. Ali\'s team completed GraphQL APIs and metadata layers by end of October, but Workbook team resourcing isn\'t allocated for integration. The disconnect stems from differing interpretations: Ali sees enrichment use cases as achievable now without federated search, while Sneh understands the Q1 timeline applies to the entire data platform pattern. This requires immediate alignment between Ali, Sneh, and Brandon to clarify phasing and prevent dataset delivery delays.

Demo environment limitations surfaced during Uber preparation, where Adam needs to demonstrate specific vertical datasets and activation flows but lacks production-equivalent data. The team previously decided against dedicated demo instances due to resourcing constraints, but the gap between Workbooks demonstrations and Workspace capabilities creates an awkward customer experience. Dominik reinforced that neither demo instances nor production customization will receive dedicated teams, requiring sellers to work within existing constraints.

Priority accounts functionality faces uncertainty around the GTM data model migration. Victor noted David Golden\'s team is building outside the data model, requiring consolidation work. The broader question Sneh raised: is the priority accounts construct worth fixing, or should the team move away from it? This touches data model assumptions and will require alignment between Sneh, Ali, and Victor on the path forward before dedicating engineering cycles.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Brandon\'s benchmark deal cycle time analysis revealed tighter distributions than expected when examining specific accounts, despite wide variance across the entire dataset. With only 800 accounts where 5+ tenants have closed deals, the dataset remains limited but shows legitimate signal for interactive, chat-based insights. The challenge ahead involves clustering accounts by tenant characteristics and normalizing for deal types---ZoomInfo appears as both a fast mover (likely smaller buys into specific personas) and slow mover depending on context.

Workspace adoption analysis identified the \"8 AM dopamine hit\" as the critical unlock for seller engagement. Adam and Victor discussed how the current experience requires too much work from users to surface value. The path forward involves pre-generated artifacts, out-of-the-box views for different personas, and natural language view creation---all minimizing friction between login and value realization. This insight is driving the November 3 feature priorities and will heavily influence the Pulses roadmap.

Studio early access customers cluster into three groups: self-directed users arriving with clear campaigns who race ahead independently; customers needing light product support but stuck without activation; and customers requiring full sales and marketing consultation on funnel stages and use case selection. The last group represents the biggest opportunity for in-product templating, where the art of the possible isn\'t well articulated. The team needs rinse-and-repeat patterns baked into the product to reduce consultation overhead and accelerate time-to-value.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

AI credit consumption reporting emerged as a trust issue during Sneh\'s week of heavy product usage. Running enrichments across 2,000 accounts with failures, reruns, and prompt adjustments created natural product friction that will compound once credits are charged. The lack of run-level logging---showing successes, failures, and credit consumption per execution---prevents users from understanding costs. Adam, Sneh, and Dominik aligned that this reporting is as important as demonstrating the end-to-end platform flow, requiring multiple design iterations to solve a problem no one in the market has fully cracked.

The Workspace team\'s work with Vivek on design systems and AI-native patterns revealed a critical transition point. Meghan\'s team and Ryan are working on similar usability improvements, suggesting potential duplicate effort. Dominik called this out directly, requesting resolution to ensure no double work occurs. The broader challenge involves moving from traditional SaaS workflow mindsets to building around how AI agents naturally create experiences, requiring careful coordination between design, product, and engineering.

**Looking Ahead**

Dreamforce next week provides concentrated customer feedback opportunities across multiple scheduled meetings, particularly valuable for Workspace demonstrations. Victor will focus on stability and reliability while gathering examples of customers and analysts calling Workspace \"different\" and \"a game changer\" to use as collateral with the sales team. The week after returns to intensive November 3 preparation, where several enablement sessions must land successfully to hit the launch date.

The platform narrative work AJ is driving---consolidating messaging across Copilot, Workspace, Studio, Context Service, and the broader product portfolio---needs completion this week ahead of the October 28 enablement session. The narrative must clearly articulate product roles, primary users, and how they work together, addressing confusion that persists even among go-to-market leadership. This becomes the anchor document for field teams and influences all product-specific talk tracks.

Roadmap operationalization remains critical coming out of the onsite alignment. Dominik emphasized that while the team achieved clarity on the short-term roadmap, alignment naturally decays without active maintenance. Sarah has the broad structure, but this can\'t be a one-off document---it needs to become a living part of weekly operations with clear reporting against milestones. The team has a window before momentum from the onsite washes away, making next week essential for establishing these operating rhythms before Dreamforce disrupts the week following.

## **GTM Studio Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team made critical progress toward November 3rd launch readiness across all core workstreams this week. Jagannath Ramesh and team completed agentic release planning and enablement materials, while Arun V enabled self-serve analytics in Pre-Prod with 5 AMs/CSMs. Ash Lauricella and Corina Soto advanced AI Data Management by kicking off M4/M5 working sessions with engineering and launching Data Health Scan prototype, with strong traction from Strat, Enterprise and Mid-Market leadership teams. Design resource constraints remain a blocker for agentic UX improvements, and GTM data model historical opportunity data gaps could delay ROI GA.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Launch readiness accelerated significantly with Jagannath completing release materials for November, finalizing AI credit realignment designs with the team, and shipping the side chat experience to production. The agentic capabilities roadmap now has clear definition with Run Columns from Chat in staging and semantic enrichment refinements underway, positioning the team to deliver paying SKUs in November.

ROI analytics reached a major milestone as Arun secured sign-off from the Copilot V2 team and successfully enabled self-serve analytics for 5 AMs/CSMs in Pre-Prod environment. Early feedback shows AMs and CSMs are responding well to the self-serve analytics agent for engagement-related queries, validating the upsell opportunity being primarily seat-based with ROI as the key unlock for customer conversations.

Data Management generated exceptional field demand, with Corina distributing 1,400 Data Health Scans to account managers and completing the design and engineering kickoff for bringing DHS into GTM Studio. The team received strong validation from Dakota, Alex Lazerowich, and Rob Lotterman\'s Enterprise teams, plus organic interest from Steve Lincoln\'s Mid-Market team, signaling this could be a significant Q4 upsell driver.

**Goals & Progress**

**Launch Readiness & Agentic Capabilities:** Jagannath made substantial progress on November launch materials completing roughly 80% of release readiness work. AI credit realignment designs were finalized after cross-team alignment sessions, with dev work resuming and targeting October 20th delivery (may slip). Studio side chat experience improvements deployed to production for Dreamforce readiness.

**ROI Analytics & Self-Serve Capabilities:** Arun advanced Studio and Workspace ROI analytics designs and product requirements defined for Workbook and Workspace ROI tracking. The self-serve analytics prototype showed strong results in Pre-Prod with 5 AMs/CSMs, who validated the agent effectively handles most engagement queries. The team is now working to finalize AI credit reduction alignment before broader rollout.

**Data Management:** Ash progressed M4 and M5 requirements documentation while kicking off working sessions with engineering to accelerate architecture planning and research. The team identified key dependencies with GTM Data Model and initiated conversations with Andres and Prateek\'s teams. RingLead usage analysis work with Chad\'s analytics team began to inform strategic roadmap prioritization decisions. Corina successfully held the design and engineering kickoff meeting for bringing Data Health Scan into GTM Studio (M3), establishing clear dependencies and development paths. For M1, the team worked with 20+ AMs and is actively working with Alex Lazerowich\'s team and Rob Lotterman\'s team on targeted customer meetings. M2 work on Enrich Premium Plus for HubSpot and MS Dynamics continues with QA and enablement material development for November release.

**GTM Config Validation:** Tingting Wu prepared GTM 0 Config formats for customer feedback sessions starting next week, achieving alignment with design and research teams on a two-track validation approach covering both content quality and UX flow. The team reached out to 11 customers for Zero Config feedback with 4 awaiting scheduling confirmation, while design prototypes neared completion and front-end discussions progressed on API and data contracts.

**Workbook Core & Signals:** Tanvi drafted learning memos and product briefs while advancing critical engineering reviews on queue requirements, cell error states, and signals parity work. Requirements and designs for queuing were updated and validated with the engineering team to ensure these priority items move forward without implementation delays. A signals parity discussion was scheduled and resulted in a decision to wait for GraphQL completion while enhancing existing intent and scoops signals to output full signal data.

**Strategic Challenges**

Design resource constraints are blocking critical agentic UX improvements that are essential for November launch. Jagannath needs designer support from Meghan Cartlidge\'s team for two key areas: the AI Data Agent enrichment configuration experience (showing how agent-built prompts and configurations work) and the full-page Studio Chat experience (starter prompts, capability explanations, and onboarding flow). Without these resources assigned this week, the team risks shipping agentic capabilities with suboptimal user experience that could impact early adoption.

GTM data model missing historical opportunity data will require to delay picking the ROI GA timeline, currently targeted for mid-December. The platform team discovered certain historical opportunity datasets are absent from GTM Data Model, which would cause pipeline progression metrics to show zeros for many customers. While the data exists in legacy tables, Andres and Asaf\'s teams need to determine how to backfill into new GTM DM tables. Additionally, the Agentic Chat powering the CFA FAQ Agent has been removed from the dashboard because the chat interface isn\'t loading properly. For certain CSMs, the interface fails to load for the same user on the same tenant, and the load times out intermittently. Raised the concerns with Agentic Chat team (Lars).

Signals parity and data onboarding continues to create friction with each new dataset requiring custom integration work. The team scheduled alignment discussions but faces a broader systemic issue where app teams end up program managing data integrations that should be owned by platform. Customer confusion around signal variations across product areas (raw signals vs recommended signals vs SalesOS) is creating trust issues, as seen when customers compare website spike signals and buyer ID signals and find unexpected discrepancies.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Customer usage patterns revealed through Early Access calls show users attempting full-sheet analysis with AI Data Agent beyond its designed scope, requesting capabilities like \"prioritize all companies\" and \"export to Salesforce.\" This validates the team\'s hypothesis about needing an overarching orchestration agent and suggests current AI Data Agent positioning needs clearer boundaries and expectations to prevent user frustration when capabilities fall short.

Signal data inconsistency across product surfaces is eroding customer trust based on multiple customer feedback sessions this week. When customers add website spikes and website buyer ID signals simultaneously, they expect data correlation but instead see populated buyer IDs with empty spike data for the same companies, creating \"is this a bug?\" questions. This highlights both an education gap and a product consistency problem requiring the data catalog work Sneh, Brahm, and Sri discussed, plus potentially signal-specific guidance within product flows.

Early Access deep dive with 22 customers (soon 27) revealed only 4 are truly healthy with clear value realization, while 3 additional accounts see tremendous potential but are blocked solely on activation to sellers. This \"last mile\" activation gap represents both a near-term conversion blocker and validates the strategic importance of Mohan\'s Copilot activation work. The remaining accounts need consultative support on use case ideation, revealing a critical gap in templates and self-service onboarding that must be addressed for scale.

Data Health Scan is generating unexpected organic demand beyond Enterprise, with Mid-Market (Steve Lincoln) teams proactively requesting to participate after seeing Enterprise traction. This suggests the business case for Data Management could be larger, with potential to drive both retention plays and cross-sell/upsell opportunities across all segments. The team received particularly strong validation from Lazer\'s staff and Rob Lotterman.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Engineering resource allocation for AI Data Management M4/M5 requires alignment with Imesh Wijewardena and Hanan Baranes on DevOps and QA gaps. While core engineering teams understand the mid-January dev complete target for MVP, resourcing gaps in critical functions could derail timelines, and Tushar Goel\'s team needs to move post-September Workbook priorities forward to maintain delivery momentum.

Design team capacity is stretched critically thin across GTM Studio initiatives, with Jagannath blocked on agentic UX improvements and multiple teams waiting for Meghan Cartlidge\'s group to assign resources. Brahm secured Yoav for Data Management design work, but the broader design pipeline for agent experiences, full-page chat, and configuration displays remains under-resourced relative to November launch needs.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week represents a critical inflection point as the team shifts from planning to execution on November 3rd launch deliverables while maintaining Dreamforce readiness. Top priorities include finalizing agentic release scope and timeline commitments, securing design resources for UX-critical features, and locking engineering capacity for Data Management M4/M5 (foundational data management capabilities in Studio) with clear resourcing plans.

The team will focus on three key workstreams that can accelerate launch readiness: (1) Arun continuing self-serve analytics enablement with more AMs/CSMs while finalizing workspace ROI prototype, (2) Ash and Corina completing engineering kickoffs for Data Management with firm resource commitments and delivery timelines, and (3) Tingting conducting customer validation sessions on GTM Config to validate zero-config quality and UX flows. (4) Jagannath\'s focus next week is on Dreamforce demo as he will be attending the event live. (5) Tanvi\'s focus next week will be continuing PRD reviews with the engineering team for December deliverables and doing a deep dive into the solution for making \"find contacts\" feature more dynamic. (6) Mohan following through on Workbook-to-Copilot activation to ensure cross-team delivery and conducting PRD and design reviews to kick off GTM Studio-to-DoubleO plays activation discoveries.

Field enablement becomes paramount with Sneh driving Clay competitive positioning and objection handling content to sales readiness, while the team refines the target account list of customers with Clay mentions for focused outreach. Success depends on resolving design resource bottlenecks this week, achieving GTM data model clarity on historical opportunity data, and maintaining momentum on Data Health Scan adoption with 10-15 high-fit accounts receiving targeted AM support.

## **Data Executive Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The data organization successfully unblocked user-level Points of Interest (POI) deployment to staging this week, positioning the team to enable enhanced signals across Copilot, Workbooks, and future AI agents. Steve Hutchinson\'s work overcame previous DevOps constraints that had stalled progress for weeks. Simultaneously, Igor Kyrylenko expanded the vertical datasets program by acquiring professional license data from 17 states, establishing the foundation for a comprehensive national licensing database that extends well beyond the original contractor-only focus.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Steve Hutchinson broke through technical blockers to advance user-level POI into staging, with production deployment expected this week or early next week. This unlocks the ability to add multiple interest types to POI, immediately improving signal relevancy for Copilot homepage and Workbooks while establishing the data foundation for future AI agent consumption. The system is designed to support downstream products as they evolve, eliminating a constraint that had limited the team\'s ability to serve personalized signals at scale.

Dana Hurtig made substantial progress synchronizing franchise data with the platform, uploading approximately 353,000 franchisor locations and developing a four-phase plan to address franchisee company cleanup. The team completed matching for roughly 350,000 franchisor contacts with a 32% match rate to existing contacts, while delivering 2.8 million enrichments---exceeding the projected target by 25% through 5x5 freemail data. This work positions the franchise dataset for full integration and customer delivery.

Brandon Wilson built two aggregated datasets for the board meeting demo focused on Copilot Next (CN) Benchmark Agent insights---Deal Cycle Insights and Win Rate analytics. The team successfully produced speed signals (whether accounts lean slow, fast, or mixed) for 28 tenants and resolved naming and grouping issues to understand full deal cycle patterns. This provides the data foundation needed to demonstrate differentiated benchmarking capabilities that only ZoomInfo can offer through contributory network participation.

**Goals & Progress**

**Data Infrastructure & User Signals:** Steve Hutchinson\'s user-level POI deployment represents a fundamental shift in how person-based signals can be delivered across products. After resolving DevOps constraints, the system is now configured to write the first interest type (previous engagement) to staging, with production deployment contingent on ZDP approval. This architecture enables the team to rapidly add facilitators, recommended contacts, and other interest types that will dramatically improve signal relevancy for Copilot users while supporting future GTM products.

**Vertical Dataset Expansion:** Igor Kyrylenko pivoted the professional license initiative from contractor-only focus to a comprehensive multi-state licensing database, acquiring datasets from 17 states and building unified source data layouts to standardize processing across disparate state formats. The team deployed scrapers targeting states with centralized licensing systems, which yield 3-4 times faster acquisition than fragmented databases. Work also advanced on the FINRA dataset as a potential Pitchbook replacement, with schema finalization and quality checks underway. An automated state data acquisition tool with email monitoring capabilities is in development to eliminate manual bottlenecks in bulk data requests.

**Benchmarking & Board Demo:** Brandon Wilson completed the Deal Cycle Insights aggregate table and Win Rate dataset needed for the CN Benchmark Agent board demonstration. The team filtered data to closed-won opportunities, worked through account naming and grouping challenges, and successfully generated insights for 28 tenants regarding their deal velocity patterns. This work directly feeds the differentiated benchmarking capabilities that will drive contributory network adoption by providing customers with insights unavailable anywhere else in the market.

**Strategic Challenges**

The franchise dataset integration revealed more complexity than initially anticipated, particularly around franchisee company synchronization with the platform. Many franchisee entities lack URLs and have limited contact coverage, which causes them to appear as low-quality profiles in the platform despite being valid businesses. Dana Hurtig is addressing this through a phased approach that processes entities in tranches based on data completeness. Additionally, the latest Rhetorik batch is failing in the Data Infusion Platform (DIP), requiring engineering assistance to diagnose and resolve the processing issues before additional EMEA company infusions can proceed.

The CN-driven agents prototyping faces a resourcing gap---while the agentic platform can support rapid prototype development, there are no dedicated engineering resources allocated for moving beyond proof-of-concept stage. Jody Roberts\' org chart agent and other data-driven agents remain constrained to prototypes without more explicit prioritization and engineering support. This creates a risk that valuable demonstrations will struggle to reach production deployment and deliver customer value.

Suresh Putteti identified sensitive personal information (social security numbers and credit card numbers) in assets related to Account AI, specifically within user prompts. While the data owner is being engaged to develop remediation plans, the discovery highlights ongoing challenges in preventing SPI from entering systems not designed to handle it. The asset is maintained for archival purposes, limiting immediate business impact, but establishing a recurring monthly remediation process will be important for continuous compliance improvement.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The team discovered that centralized state licensing systems provide 3-4 times faster data acquisition than fragmented databases, fundamentally shifting the professional license expansion strategy. Rather than pursuing all states uniformly, Igor Kyrylenko is prioritizing states with consolidated systems, allowing the team to build coverage more rapidly while developing scrapers and standardized taxonomies. The automated email tool being developed will further accelerate bulk data requests by eliminating manual attachment collection, creating a scalable acquisition model for professional licensing data.

Dana Hurtig\'s franchise work revealed that pre-validation quality checks need significant improvement to better estimate what constitutes \"good\" data before infusion. The team encountered URL inactivity issues affecting approximately 43% of records in LatAM data, causing profiles to become unpublished despite representing valid businesses. This insight applies beyond franchise data---many small businesses globally lack working websites but remain legitimate entities that customers want to reach. The team is developing more sophisticated validation approaches that assess entity validity beyond simple URL checks.

Brandon Wilson\'s benchmarking work confirmed that closed-won opportunity data provides reliable ACV amounts, while open opportunities and closed-lost deals contain unreliable values that cannot be trusted for analysis. This validation from Steve Hutchinson shapes how the team approaches deal cycle insights---filtering to closed-won deals ensures data integrity while accepting some limitations in analyzing in-progress opportunities. The team will need to leverage GTM Store API datasets for more accurate ACV analysis when expanding beyond basic deal cycle metrics.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the DaaS organization on vertical dataset enablement continues to be important for scaling the motion beyond high-touch strategic accounts. Dow Jones is establishing recurring one-on-one meetings with sales managers and attending weekly team meetings to ensure proper enablement and account targeting. The Money 20/20 executive-led outreach campaign represents a new motion that requires coordination between data, DaaS, and sales leadership to effectively message vertical dataset value to good-fit accounts. This campaign will provide important feedback on messaging effectiveness and help refine the repeatable patterns needed to drive the \$10M H2 goal.

The DevOps and ZDP teams were essential partners in unblocking Steve Hutchinson\'s POI deployment. After weeks of constraint, their prioritization enabled progress on user-level interest types that unlock value across multiple products. Going forward, maintaining strong collaboration with these teams will be necessary as the data organization scales POI to include facilitators, recommended contacts, and other interest types that power enhanced signals.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on three primary areas: advancing POI interest types into production, continuing franchise dataset integration with full franchisee company processing, and finalizing professional license data categorization across the 17 acquired states.

Steve Hutchinson will push user-level POI into production for the first interest type while preparing development work for facilitators and recommended contacts. This progression enables downstream products to begin consuming enhanced person-based signals while the team builds out additional interest types. Dana Hurtig will complete franchisee company infusions following the four-phase plan developed this week, addressing data quality issues systematically to ensure platform integration doesn\'t create noise in customer-facing profiles. The team also needs to resolve Rhetorik DIP failures with engineering support to unblock additional EMEA company infusions that customers are requesting.

Igor Kyrylenko will categorize and align license types and subtypes across the 17 acquired states to create a standardized taxonomy, deploy scrapers for 2-4 additional high-priority states with centralized systems, and finalize the FINRA schema with quality checks and delivery specifications. The automated acquisition tool for email and attachment functionality will move into production testing. Brandon Wilson continues refining the Deal Cycle Insights and Win Rate datasets for the board demonstration, with Dominik requesting sample data. The team is well-positioned to deliver differentiated benchmarking capabilities that showcase contributory network value while driving toward customer-facing implementations in Q4.

## **SalesOS/Copilot Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Copilot Workspace achieved a major milestone this week with internal Frontline GTM team launch, revealing valuable user feedback that will shape GA readiness. The team is addressing a key disconnect between chat and views experiences, with Adam Severance leading foundational improvements to views, chat, and first-time user experience---all design complete with scoping targeted for November 3 release. Gabe Pirela delivered the draft Copilot/Chorus convergence roadmap targeting February customer migrations, establishing a strategic foundation for reducing surface area through agents and artifacts rather than brick-by-brick rebuilding. On ZoomInfo Intent, Harinath Krishnamoorthy completed a functional Cline prototype for Persona-Based Intent in Copilot, ready for Pre-Sales and PM validation sessions that will enable engineering handoff. For Admin Zero Experience, David Goulden finalized enablement packs for Admin-Defined Territories GA (now targeting mid-November), with four additional beta customers onboarded and workflow robustness solutions implemented.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Copilot Workspace Internal Launch and User Feedback: The Frontline GTM team began using Workspace this week, generating immediate actionable feedback through one-off sessions with Ant Cuomo. The primary discovery reveals users struggle to understand the relationship between chat and views---they don\'t recognize what\'s possible with the tool or how table artifacts from chat could integrate with views. This early feedback from actual go-to-market users is accelerating product refinement ahead of GA, with the team documenting gaps in user experience that will inform November release priorities.

ZoomInfo Intent Persona-Based Prototype Validation: Harinath Krishnamoorthy delivered a working Cline prototype demonstrating persona-based Intent topic configuration in Copilot, compressing the traditional PRD-to-prototype timeline from six weeks to one week using AI-powered development tools. The prototype brings to life the hypothesis that role-based default configurations will increase users moving beyond defaults from 15% to 35%. Pre-Sales validation sessions scheduled this week will gather feedback on customer-facing usability and implementation feasibility before engineering handoff, ensuring the team solves the right problem before costly development begins.

Admin Zero Experience Territories GA Preparation: David Goulden completed enablement pack creation for Admin-Defined Territories GA release, implementing workflow robustness solutions that automatically reassign workflows when user permissions change or users leave the organization. The team added four additional beta customers eager to access the feature before GA, while also addressing retention challenges through root cause analysis---revealing that while initial onboarding engagement is strong, sustained adoption requires both feature improvements and customer change management support.

**Goals & Progress**

**Copilot Workspace:** Adam Severance made significant progress on foundational views and chat improvements driven by persistent first-time user experience problems. The team identified two critical friction points: users get confused when creating views or configuring fields/filters, and after sending one chat message, users become lost and can\'t find past chats or artifacts. Adam built comprehensive requirements in Replit over the weekend, secured directional alignment from Sean Walter and Megan Cartlidge, and is moving forward with design complete and LOE scoping targeted for November 3 release. The improvements will surface past artifacts at the same level as chat threads (or higher), introduce a table format allowing users to search artifacts by company with logos visible, and fundamentally improve how first-time users understand view functionality.

**ZoomInfo Intent:** Harinath Krishnamoorthy advanced three parallel Intent initiatives this week. He completed a comparative analysis document on Multi-AFS configuration approaches (account-level vs. user-level), awaiting clear problem definition from the Data Science team led by Robyn before finalizing recommendations. He aligned with Tanvi from GTM Studio on Intent signal integration for Workbook Creation and Enrichment workflows, establishing tentative November implementation timeline. The persona-based Intent prototype is now ready for stakeholder validation, with Pre-Sales and PM review sessions enabling feedback before platform team handoff. The fourth planned initiative---comprehensive quality analysis of Data Science Intent Recommendation improvements across SMB, MidMarket, and Enterprise segments---did not progress this week due to competing priorities.

**Admin Zero Experience:** David Goulden pushed Admin-Defined Territories GA to mid-November (from October 20) to accommodate UI refinements for admin experience, since workbooks activation isn\'t blocking the release. The team implemented workflow robustness scripting that finds the next best user (based on admin status, workflow permissions, and signal visibility entitlements) when workflow owners lose permissions or leave the organization. Beta rollout continues with strong initial engagement but concerning retention patterns requiring further investigation into whether issues stem from feature gaps, customer change management, or signal quality. On Priority Accounts based on GTM Data Model, testing of new APIs continues with the goal of making target accounts, whitespace with signals, and activity-based suggestions available as out-of-the-box lists in Workspace, though data harmonization across ZDP, BigQuery, and legacy Solar remains a challenge with December proof-of-concept timeline pushing actual release to Q1 2026.

**Additional Initiatives:** Dylan Halladay progressed significantly on slides artifact planning and requirements, completing a strategic document framing feature importance and development sequencing. The team explored Google Slides API vs. PowerPoint approaches, with major trade-offs requiring executive decision. Regardless of path chosen, a critical dependency emerged: integrating and authenticating users to Google Drive and Google Workspaces to enable adding presentations to user drives---engineering called this out of scope for first milestone but Dylan argues Workspace fundamentally needs this capability for document artifacts and unified go-to-market hub positioning. Ant Cuomo kicked off company profiles development with focus on phasing and dependencies, coordinating with Andres (per Sarah Heritage, Victor Oliveros, and Dominik Facher\'s request) to march toward GTM Data Model as the source of truth and avoid repeating Workspace tech debt from chapter one. The team is identifying data source gaps across prompt service, agents, and legacy APIs. On mobile, Ant progressed toward November 3 internal beta with concepts for January MVP complete, requiring partnership with Derek and the 00 team on feed support. Gabe Pirela supported multiple Q4 Chorus renewal meetings this week while finalizing the Copilot/Chorus convergence roadmap with updates based on Victor\'s feedback and Sarah Heritage\'s requirements.

**Strategic Challenges**

Copilot Workspace Chat and Views Disconnection: Users fundamentally don\'t understand the relationship between chat and views experiences in Workspace, creating a barrier to feature adoption. The immediate manifestation is users cannot add table artifacts generated in chat to views, leaving them with fragmented data across the product. Adam Severance spent the weekend building comprehensive requirements to address this through foundational improvements that surface artifacts at the same level as threads, enable searching by company with logo visibility, and simplify view creation. While the path forward is clear with design complete and scoping underway for November 3, this represents a make-or-break moment for GA adoption since the Frontline GTM team using Workspace this week will inform whether go-to-market leaders confidently sell the product at Dreamforce and post-11.3 launch.

ZoomInfo Intent Multi-AFS Configuration Clarity: Harinath Krishnamoorthy created a comprehensive pros and cons analysis comparing account-level versus user-level AFS configuration approaches but encountered difficulty obtaining clear problem definition from the Data Science team. Multiple conversations with Robyn yielded shifting explanations---sometimes citing model-level improvements, sometimes explainability challenges, sometimes configurability concerns---preventing confident architectural decision-making. The team is waiting for Robyn to articulate the exact problem being solved before proceeding, as this configuration choice will impact how thousands of customers interact with Multi-AFS capabilities and could require costly rework if decided incorrectly. Harinath will review the comparative analysis document with Victor Oliveros before surfacing final recommendations to the Data Science team once problem clarity emerges.

Admin Zero Experience Workbooks Demo Path OAuth Blocker: Ant Cuomo identified a technical blocker for the critical workbooks-to-workspace demo path needed for October launch demonstrations. The intended flow---logging into Workspace production, logging out of Salesforce production, and logging into Salesforce demo instance---currently fails with OAuth errors because Workspace hasn\'t been configured as an app in the Salesforce demo environment. Kristen initiated a thread last week with a Salesforce admin who appeared deactivated this morning, requiring immediate escalation up the chain. Ant needs validation that this works today or tomorrow at latest, as this demo path is fundamental for October demonstrations. The resolution path is clear (configure Workspace in Salesforce demo environment) but requires urgent cross-functional coordination with Salesforce administrators who may lack bandwidth or context on the priority.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

User Mental Model Mismatch on Context Persistence: Adam Severance discovered through user interviews this week that many users believe opening a chat thread over a specific profile maintains ongoing context and superior information about that company compared to general chat queries. This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how Workspace chat works---users expect spatial context (where they opened chat) to create persistent conversational context, similar to how profile pages maintain company-specific information. This insight suggests the product needs clearer communication about when and how context gets passed to chat, potentially through visual indicators or explicit context confirmation when users open chat from specific locations. The finding also reinforces the importance of ensuring chat actually does receive and utilize context from where it\'s invoked, making the implicit user expectation match actual product behavior.

Copilot Pulse as Differentiated Value Proposition: Victor Oliveros shared that the Copilot Pulse concept (ChatGPT Pulse adapted for go-to-market) received significant attention during the product offsite, with executives recognizing organic value for AMs, managers, and leaders receiving weekly updates. Unlike consumer ChatGPT Pulse which lacks clear use cases, the go-to-market application addresses a fundamental need for account and pipeline intelligence delivered proactively. The first phase targets December delivery, allowing users to prompt and create pulses in Workspace (as artifacts or from prompts) and receive them on mobile---establishing single-player value before expanding to RevOps-created pulses pushed from GTM Studio plays. This insight reinforces that the same AI capabilities packaged for business contexts can unlock differentiated value that consumer applications cannot, and that mobile may find its killer use case through proactive intelligence delivery rather than trying to replicate desktop functionality.

Early Prototype Validation Prevents Costly Development Rework: Harinath Krishnamoorthy\'s experience with persona-based Intent prototyping reinforced the power of rapid AI-assisted development to compress validation timelines. By using Cline to build a functional demonstration in one week (versus the traditional six-week PRD-to-prototype cycle), the team can gather Pre-Sales and PM feedback before engineering handoff---ensuring they solve the right problem before significant development investment. This pattern of \"build to learn\" rather than \"document to build\" is proving especially valuable for novel AI features where user expectations and product capabilities need alignment through tangible experience rather than written specifications. The broader implication is that product teams should default to rapid prototyping for new experiences, reserving comprehensive documentation for features where requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change based on user interaction.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the GTM Data Model team on company and contact profiles continues to be essential for avoiding tech debt accumulation. Ant Cuomo is coordinating with Andres this week to ensure profiles are built on the GTM Data Model as the source of truth rather than repeating the pattern from Workspace chapter one where the team accumulated technical debt through expedient but unsustainable architectural decisions. The conversation centers on identifying gaps in timing and data source availability across prompt service, agents, and legacy APIs. This dependency is particularly acute because company profiles will reach hundreds of thousands of users, making it a high-visibility test case for whether the GTM Data Model can support production-scale product experiences, and the team needs clear commitment on what data will be available when to make informed phasing decisions.

The Salesforce administration team dependency for the workbooks-to-workspace demo path requires immediate resolution. Ant Cuomo escalated this morning after discovering the west coast Salesforce admin who Kristen contacted last week appears deactivated, blocking validation of the critical demo flow needed for October launch. The team needs Workspace configured as an app in the Salesforce demo environment to enable OAuth authentication when users switch from production to demo instances. This is diplomatically a coordination and prioritization challenge rather than a technical barrier, requiring executive air cover to ensure Salesforce administrators understand the urgency and business impact of enabling this configuration immediately.

**Looking Ahead**

The team\'s primary focus next week centers on Dreamforce preparation and Workspace production readiness, with 56 executive meetings booked (targeting 100) at the W Hotel Lounge where Workspace will be demonstrated as the primary product. Go-to-market leaders including Tuna, Breyers, and AR are training to demo Workspace themselves this week---if they have a positive experience and customers respond well at Dreamforce, that evidence will determine whether leadership fully backs the product post-11.3 launch. This makes production testing and cherry-picking what gets pushed versus held back absolutely critical.

On Copilot Workspace, Adam Severance will finalize design and LOE scoping for foundational views and chat improvements, sharing screen recordings and documentation with Victor Oliveros to assess A-B testability and tracking from Phoebe\'s analytics perspective. Ant Cuomo must resolve the Salesforce demo environment OAuth blocker immediately to validate the workbooks-to-workspace demo path, while continuing profiles development with clear data source identification and Recommendation Agent (formerly NBA) iteration focused on demonstrating value with both complete and imperfect context. Dylan Halladay will complete the slides artifact requirements document and make progress on the ReachOut Gmail integration POC, enabling the team to summarize or propose email drafts when users open Gmail threads.

For ZoomInfo Intent, Harinath Krishnamoorthy will conduct Pre-Sales and PM validation sessions on the persona-based Intent prototype, review the Multi-AFS configuration analysis with Victor Oliveros once the Data Science team provides clear problem definition, and work with Tanvi on GTM Studio Intent filter requirements. David Goulden will focus on Priority Accounts API testing and finalizing admin UI refinements for Admin-Defined Territories mid-November GA. The team demonstrated aggressive positioning at the product offsite with a roadmap targeting AE and AM market capture this year, sales-adjacent personas by June, and initial CRM customers by end of next year---now the execution against these commitments begins with Dreamforce as the first major external validation point.

## **Intelligence Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Dreamforce is live next week, and the team successfully enabled \~30 GTM reps with Context Service access, training materials, and feedback channels. While limited rep feedback came through pre-event, systems are stress-tested and ready. Concurrently, the team stabilized Copilot Workspace for high-visibility demos with several critical bug fixes deployed, though a few issues with target accounts, HTML artifacts, and home-to-chat loading remain under investigation. The broader strategic shift is taking shape: custom signals are moving into the plays infrastructure where they belong, and there\'s growing alignment to deprecate the legacy signals/insights layer that\'s accumulating technical debt without delivering proportional value.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Rowan Bailey orchestrated full Dreamforce readiness by running training sessions, establishing a feedback Slack channel, creating cheat sheets and demo videos, and hosting office hours for 30+ reps. The most valuable insight came from watching reps test beyond the steel thread---combining ZoomInfo account research with Claude\'s web search to enrich deals with industry context proved particularly powerful when prompts specified tool execution order. Lars Vedo and Ryan Stevens pushed through stabilization work on Copilot Workspace, shipping batches of improvements while testing Sonnet 4.5 (which is performing well) and addressing latency issues with Vertex that add roughly 2 seconds per failed call before fallback to Anthropic.

Derek Osgood achieved a breakthrough on DoubleO integration, getting a basic version live in staging and clearing up months of circular conversations with the workflows team. The path forward is now clear: DoubleO becomes the base framework for all workflow capabilities, with workflows components becoming the actions used by agents, and a shared triggers layer built on custom signals. Integration will be smoother than expected---the first version simply swaps in existing OpenAI tools as-is before gradually moving to hybrid MCP tools.

Robyn finalized Lookalikes API is now available for the top 100K most-requested companies, providing reps with fast candidate generation and similarity results to enrich targeting and segmentation efforts. Next steps to work with the Workbooks team for integration planned for Jan 12 release.

Srivatsa Marthi made critical architectural progress on signal configuration after connecting with Derek. The realization: custom signals should live within the plays infrastructure rather than as standalone config, since any logic on top of raw data belongs in the play engine. This crystallized a larger strategic insight---the entire signals and insights layer needs deprecation. Built for the old Copilot world, it\'s now just adding complexity without sufficient value, and every month without migration accumulates more debt.

**Goals & Progress**

**Dreamforce Launch Preparation:** Rowan Bailey completed rep enablement with training sessions, feedback channels, cheat sheets, video walkthroughs, and testing office hours. Approximately 24 of 30 reps are fully activated and ready to demo GTM Context Service via Claude. Authentication issues (header size problems from oversized cookies/tokens) were resolved by extending header limits. The team is maintaining standby support throughout the event with one final office hours session Monday before the Tuesday launch.

**Copilot Workspace Stabilization:** Lars Vedo and team focused on zero-regression deployment, shipping incremental improvements while holding major updates. Current blockers include unreliable target account pulls, non-interactive HTML artifacts, and occasional home-to-chat loading failures. The team layered in Salesforce integration improvements to give agents better context on user hierarchy, recent activity, and custom fields. Sonnet 4.5 testing shows strong results with updated prompts, though Vertex latency issues (roughly 2-second delay per 429 error before Anthropic fallback) require tuning to avoid compounding across multi-call turns.

**DoubleO Integration & Tool Migration:** Derek Osgood deployed a basic version of DoubleO in ZoomInfo staging (tools not yet enabled) and aligned with workflows team on integration architecture. All existing core tools have been triaged and updated with new descriptions and refined logic. The integration path leverages existing OpenAI tooling initially, then gradually migrates to hybrid MCP tools that read from GTM Store and write directly to APIs. Key missing MCP capabilities like Salesforce object association are documented, with teams erring toward restriction to avoid instance corruption. Primary blocker remains engineering resourcing, though leadership committed to resolution by week\'s end.

**Strategic Challenges**

The APS integration into Workbooks hit architectural friction that requires redesigning the approach. Since Workbooks streams data via events without default sorting, records appear in arbitrary creation order rather than ranked by relevance---problematic for demos and actual usage where sellers expect to see the best prospects first. Applying sorts during streaming creates jarring UX, and waiting until completion to sort via APS defeats the real-time experience. The team is exploring solutions like default sortable columns users can apply post-load, or async operations for CSV uploads where default sorts can be pre-applied. This connects to a broader realization that Workbooks\' tight coupling to its current architecture may be too inflexible for frontline seller workflows.

Engineering resource allocation remains the persistent blocker across multiple initiatives. Derek\'s DoubleO work has only one dedicated engineer (Sumont), Robyn\'s roadmap is stalled awaiting clarity on which applications will adopt lookalike MCPs and where UX resources are allocated, and the broader team is stretching across Dreamforce, Copilot stabilization, and H2 planning simultaneously. Leadership acknowledged an approximately 2:1 ratio of roadmap to available PM and engineering capacity. Philip has a goal to complete all engineering resource shifts by end of week to support the locked-down roadmap, with an ask for 11 engineers (including frontend) for DoubleO. The team needs dedicated squads that can move with the velocity of semantic data and agentic teams rather than traditional program management cycles.

Product hierarchy and ML prioritization needs leadership alignment before Robyn can move forward effectively. There\'s significant pushback from engineering on creating all algorithms as MCPs for chat, and uncertainty about whether structured product hierarchy remains a priority after Carlos flagged it as at-risk for deprioritization. The team needs roadmap review and prioritization clarity with new engineering leadership, particularly around Workbooks ranking expectations and how APS should integrate with Workspace insights versus standalone recommendations work.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The team identified a fundamental architectural shift that should reshape H2 priorities: custom signals and the broader signals/insights layer need migration into the plays infrastructure. Srivatsa\'s conversations with Derek revealed that any \"logic on top of raw data\" belongs in the play engine rather than as standalone services. This isn\'t just a technical refactoring---the entire signals and insights layer was designed for the old Copilot paradigm and now adds complexity without proportional value. Every month without migration accumulates debt as more consumers (including Copilot V1 which won\'t deprecate soon) remain dependent on the old system. The migration path is complex but necessary, and leadership appears receptive since it aligns with broader appetite for deprecating maintenance-heavy systems that don\'t deliver 10x outcomes.

Office hours sessions with Dreamforce reps surfaced valuable prompt engineering patterns that the team should codify. When users specified tool execution order---running ZoomInfo account research first, then enriching with Claude\'s web research for industry context---the combined output quality jumped significantly. This suggests the system would benefit from more explicit guidance on multi-tool orchestration strategies, potentially as prompt templates or suggested workflows. The reps\' natural tendency to push beyond the steel thread also revealed use cases (meeting prep combining account research with semantic data, competitive landscape analysis) that should inform the Context Service roadmap once the event wraps.

Vertex latency patterns are adding measurable drag to the user experience that will compound at scale. Each 429 error costs roughly 2 seconds before fallback to Anthropic, so a turn requiring 5 LLM calls can add 10 seconds of pure wait time from retry logic. The team is investigating whether this is a Vertex reliability issue or a configuration problem on the ZoomInfo side, but regardless, the Cloudflare AI Gateway should address this class of problem through better load balancing and failover. Ryan Stevens is coordinating with Benny\'s team to ensure proper evaluation this month rather than rushing to meet an arbitrary October 15th deadline that was never realistic given vendor procurement timelines.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Workbooks integration requires deeper architectural alignment before the team can deliver on AI capabilities that leadership is pitching to customers. The streaming event architecture that makes Workbooks feel fast creates fundamental conflicts with ranked results from APS, credit forecasting UX, and semantic data integration.

The resource allocation conversation with Philip and Dominic needs resolution by Monday to unblock DoubleO delivery for December. Derek requires a dedicated squad of engineers (the 11-person ask includes frontend) that can operate with the autonomy and velocity of semantic data and agentic teams rather than traditional program management. Adam proposed giving Derek and Karthik a subset of engineers to \"run like we run semantic data\" and just push through for December, but this requires Sarah Heritage to lock down the roadmap first. The dependency chain is clear: roadmap locked → Philip shifts resources by week\'s end → Derek gets focused squad → December delivery becomes achievable.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week is Dreamforce execution mode with the team maintaining standby support for the 30 reps demoing Context Service. Rowan is running one final office hours Monday before the Tuesday event, then shifting focus to collecting structured feedback and identifying quick wins versus longer-term improvements. The engineering team will monitor system performance under real load and tune alerts accordingly.

The more strategic focus shifts to H2 planning and architectural cleanup. Srivatsa is documenting the signals/insights deprecation plan to free up engineering attention and reduce system complexity---work that should get strong leadership support given the broader push to reduce maintenance burden. Derek will kick off in earnest once engineering resources are allocated, starting with first batch of tools live by Tuesday and spinning up plays in staging to identify tool gaps. Robyn needs roadmap alignment meetings to clarify ML/agent prioritization and get engineering commitment on MCP strategies.

Across the team, the November 3rd go-live date for Workspace and Copilot sales enablement is the forcing function. All reps should be trained and actively pitching by then, which means the next three weeks are about polish, stability, and rep enablement rather than new features. The team proved this week they can ship incremental value while maintaining stability for high-visibility demos---that discipline needs to carry through October while the deeper architectural work (plays, signals migration, DoubleO) progresses in parallel.

## **Core Data Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Cam Fortin achieved alignment on data drift strategy for the on-demand cube solution (M7.2), securing cross-functional buy-in for a significant technical change that creates incentives for customers to adopt more frequent cube delivery cycles. Magnus Herweyer convened executive leadership including Dominik and Philip to ensure a shared understanding of our email deliverability improvement needs, and will build a comprehensive roadmap addressing critical infrastructure needs that currently limit our ability to publish contacts at scale. Meanwhile, Rituparna Das drove analysis of board of directors data processes, identifying scalable methods to extend this high-value offering beyond Barclays to multiple pending customer requests while discovering previously undocumented infusion methods that will accelerate delivery.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Cam Fortin completed securing cross-team alignment for introducing a new data drift paradigm when launching the on-demand cube solution (M7.2), overcoming initial nervousness to achieve consensus that this change provides strategic advantages. The alignment includes support for Scott\'s vision of starting customers on cubes before transitioning them to incremental updates via webhooks, creating a clear migration path toward real-time data delivery. This positions the team to fundamentally change customer expectations around data freshness.

The data explainability tool launched by Hayden Cowell\'s team provides customer success teams with clear rationale for email and mobile phone number selection, addressing a critical gap in customer communication. The tool translates complex backend logic into plain English explanations, making data decisions transparent and building customer trust in our data quality processes.

Heather Ma advanced the deal cycle insights agent to 60% completion, successfully normalizing opportunity data and creating percentile distributions for deal velocity analysis. After sharing initial prototypes with Brandon Tucker, the team pivoted from absolute metrics to relative speed comparisons, identifying that classifying companies as \"slow movers\" or \"fast movers\" based on peer benchmarks provides more actionable customer insights than raw day counts.

**Goals & Progress**

**Email Deliverability Infrastructure:** Magnus Herweyer convened a comprehensive meeting with Dominik, Philip, Jody, Brandon, and John to establish a master plan spanning short, medium, and long-term improvements over the next year. The team identified 10 critical initiatives to improve email deliverability, though Magnus remains at 75% completion pending final documentation. Critical learnings emerged about shared services strategy - if customers derive value from a capability (email validation, phone classification), it should be exposed as a consumable service via APIs.

**Board of Directors Data Cube:** Rituparna Das completed analysis revealing limited overlap between Barclays\' existing board data cube and new customer requirements, necessitating a ground-up rebuild for scalability. The team identified critical data logic issues and classification gaps that PTI engineering will address, while discovering an existing method for infusing board member contacts that hadn\'t been properly documented or communicated to the data team.

**Data Quality Monitoring:** Hayden Cowell\'s team addressed critical blockers in employer accuracy measurement after discovering that postal code data disappeared from 50% of ground truth samples. While this was an intended architectural change moving away from office locations toward CRM data, the lack of cross-functional communication created measurement gaps. The team will pivot to using city-level data for accuracy metrics while establishing better alerting systems for future changes.

**Strategic Challenges**

The postal code data loss incident exposed significant gaps in cross-functional communication around data architecture changes. While talent and sales teams were aligned on moving away from office locations as the address gold standard, the quality measurement team wasn\'t informed, resulting in compromised accuracy metrics for Q4. Hayden and Rituparna are establishing new protocols to anticipate and communicate such changes proactively.

Social locations data faces technical roadblocks with service failures preventing UI updates despite successful backend processing. The indexer shows updated social locations, but the SalesOS UI continues displaying outdated information due to BigTable synchronization issues. This creates customer confusion and support tickets despite the underlying data being correct.

Heather Ma discovered extensive data quality issues in CRM opportunity data, with widespread mismatches between account names and ZoomInfo company IDs. Google alone appears with multiple incorrect variations including \"random flower shop\" associations, indicating systemic matching service problems that compromise agent accuracy. The team needs to leverage ZoomInfo\'s own CRM associations as the validated source of truth.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Magnus Herweyer crystallized the shared services strategy through discussions with Brandon and Jody: any data capability that provides customer value should be exposed as a consumable service. This clarity transforms shared services from an internal efficiency play to a customer-facing value proposition, enabling customers to leverage ZoomInfo\'s data quality capabilities across their entire data ecosystem, not just ZoomInfo-sourced data.

The web data acquisition team\'s analysis revealed that GPT-4o can normalize approximately 76,000 addresses for just \$13.66 - a cost point that makes large-scale address normalization economically viable. Magnus calculated that normalizing 8 million addresses would cost roughly \$1,400, \"probably cheaper than the coffee we supply all the offices,\" opening possibilities for comprehensive database cleanup initiatives.

The deal cycle insights pivot from absolute to relative metrics represents a fundamental shift in how we approach benchmarking data. Rather than telling customers a deal took \"45 days,\" classifying companies as \"slow movers\" relative to their industry peers provides actionable intelligence that drives sales strategy decisions.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with platform teams on monitoring requirements for v7.2 remains blocked, with requirements supposedly due in November but lacking clarity. Jody flagged this as a critical risk - the shift from 3-week cube validation cycles to weekly updates fundamentally changes our quality assurance paradigm, requiring heavy reliance on monitoring and rapid decision-making.

The org chart agent development revealed that Google Active Directory data, while limited in coverage (10-80% depending on the customer), provides more accurate reporting relationships than our current system. John Durst discovered he\'s incorrectly mapped as reporting to \"Dan, head of product for CS,\" highlighting the need to prioritize GAL data with our existing methodology as a fallback.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on converting this week\'s strategic alignments into executable plans while addressing the technical debt exposed by cross-functional communication gaps.

Rituparna Das will complete social location updates for millions of contacts once engineering resolves the BigTable synchronization issues, while simultaneously onboarding vendor management responsibilities from the departing Agnel. Magnus Herweyer will finalize the email deliverability master plan documentation and work with analysis teams to define normalization requirements for shared services, establishing what standardized formats customers can configure. Heather Ma will continue normalizing CRM opportunity data while awaiting legal\'s final approval on the contributory network data sharing page, targeting demo-ready benchmarking capabilities for executive presentations.

The convergence of on-demand cube capabilities, shared services vision, and agent platform development creates opportunity for transformative customer experiences, but success depends on addressing the operational gaps in cross-functional communication and establishing robust monitoring systems for our accelerated delivery cycles.

## **GTM Data Platform Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The Data Platform team completed critical dependency mapping across GraphQL initiatives and finalized the Q4-2026 roadmap for stakeholder review, establishing the foundation for accelerated delivery on AgentForce, GTM Studio, and Copilot Pro. Linda Johannessen led the stakeholder alignment work, identifying potential bottlenecks before they become execution risks. However, conflicting priority signals across teams threaten to dilute focus---the team cannot simultaneously support January workbooks delivery, federated search integration, schema migrations, and external API release without clear sequencing decisions. Next week centers on locking in agreed priorities and timelines so engineering refinement can proceed with confidence.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Linda Johannessen completed a comprehensive stakeholder overview mapping all inbound dependencies across GraphQL, Copilot, and enrichment initiatives. The work revealed how platform capabilities must sequence together---workbooks requiring federated search, which in turn requires schema registry and type migrations---providing the visibility needed to prevent downstream blockers rather than fixing them reactively.

Marc Delurgio initiated planning for data entitlement and access rules for GraphQL API, with engineering exploring an efficient path through federated search for entitlements since that functionality already exists. This approach could accelerate implementation by leveraging existing infrastructure rather than building from scratch, though the team is evaluating whether routing through multiple hops introduces unacceptable latency.

Moshik Levin finalized external communication assets for the CMD Enrich API changes, working with Brandon from customer solutions to handle outreach to affected accounts. The team learned that Master Data API customers represent a distinct population from other enrichment API users, requiring targeted communication strategies rather than broad announcements.

**Goals & Progress**

**GraphQL & API Development:** The Q4-2026 roadmap and deck are ready for engineering refinement, with current top focus on Copilot and enrichment with engagement data. Marc Delurgio reviewed scope for data entitlement and access rules, confirming that engineering can potentially hook into well-established entitlement services through federated search. The open question around how customers would pay for engagements requires resolution before full implementation planning can proceed.

**Customer Communication & Migration:** Moshik Levin shared documentation and communication assets for the Company Master Data Enrich API transition, preparing customers who still use deprecated Everstring fields. The team identified affected accounts and drafted targeted messaging, learning that this customer segment has minimal overlap with other API users. Brandon from customer solutions will drive the outreach, with materials emphasizing that fields won\'t be deprecated but will simply stop receiving new data---a critical distinction that prevents unnecessary engineering panic.

**Federated Search Integration:** Menna Rashwan identified and prioritized the initial set of ZoomInfo fields (Company and Person) required to support the first iteration of federated search integration via GraphQL. This work unblocks the integration by aligning on priority use cases and field-level search requirements, establishing the foundation for standardized, cross-platform operator behavior.

**Strategic Challenges**

Priority alignment remains the most significant execution risk. Messaging on priorities, scope, and timelines varies across teams and documents, creating room for conflicting interpretations that will slow delivery if not addressed immediately. Linda Johannessen noted that the team cannot realistically deliver everything requested in the desired timelines---for example, supporting January workbooks delivery while simultaneously externalizing the API in parallel would risk failing at both. The complexity lies in dependency chains: workbooks requires federated search requires schema migrations, all of which must complete before external release makes sense.

Resource constraints are becoming more acute as application teams increase engagement. Marc Delurgio pointed out that the external API goal was set when app teams weren\'t yet engaged and focused on workbooks, but now that they\'re actively involved, the platform must prioritize their needs. The good news is that work needed for external API will be covered by federated search integration, making a February 2026 external release feasible if workbooks remains the primary focus. However, this requires explicit prioritization decisions rather than attempting parallel execution.

The team identified a gap in federated search support for ZoomInfo data access rules, where record-level suppression is enforced but field-level suppression is not yet supported. Ownership of field suppression logic resides with another team, requiring cross-functional coordination to ensure end-to-end privacy compliance before federated search scales across first-party, second-party, and third-party data sources.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The metadata and schema work emerging as a strategic lever in an agent-driven world. As engineers actively ask to use GraphQL---a strong signal of growing adoption momentum---the team recognizes that Model Context Protocol (MCP) and metadata aren\'t just technical requirements but fundamental enablers for both human and AI agent consumption of platform capabilities.

Communication clarity prevents downstream confusion. Moshik Levin\'s work on the Everstring transition revealed that the initial messaging wasn\'t clear enough about the distinction between deprecating fields versus stopping population of those fields. The team learned to emphasize that this is not a breaking change---fields remain available, they just won\'t receive new data---preventing customers from unnecessarily engaging engineering resources to handle a non-existent problem.

Federated search architecture decisions have cascading implications. The team discovered that existing platform-level privacy functionality can potentially be leveraged to support third-party data access rules within search, minimizing duplication and ensuring alignment with broader platform standards. However, the field-level suppression gap requires attention before federated search can safely scale.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Collaboration with the External API team has surfaced timing and scope questions for GraphQL support. The external gateway work represents the primary missing component for public release, but the team can leverage internal testing with workbooks to validate functionality before external exposure. Marc Delurgio and Linda Johannessen are working to ensure the November external release path remains viable while not compromising January workbooks delivery.

Coordination with application teams has intensified as workbooks engagement increases. The team is carefully balancing immediate platform needs with longer-term strategic goals, recognizing that successful workbooks delivery will validate the platform architecture and create momentum for external API release in early 2026.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on establishing definitive priority sequencing and confirming timelines so the roadmap can be finalized and engineering refinement can move forward without ambiguity. Linda Johannessen will meet with engineering leads to gather high-level effort estimates and identify potential bottlenecks.

The team will drive toward clear decisions on GraphQL path prioritization---specifically whether to sequence federated search integration first, followed by external API exposure, or attempt parallel execution. The dependency mapping completed this week provides the foundation for informed trade-off discussions, and stakeholder alignment on a single agreed reference will enable sharper sequencing and faster delivery on work that matters most.

Marc Delurgio will continue refining the data entitlement and access rules scope, ensuring alignment between platform-level privacy controls and application-specific needs. Moshik Levin will finalize customer communications with Brandon from customer solutions, ensuring affected accounts receive clear, accurate information about the CMD Enrich API transition. The team remains confident in their ability to deliver high-impact platform capabilities while maintaining the architectural quality and data governance standards required for long-term success.

## **Integrations Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Prateek Paikray delivered full Agentforce functionality, training, and materials for Dreamforce. Sanyog Rai completed a customer self-service frontend prototype for configuring GTM Engagement-sourced Account, Contact, Account Team Role record creation - additionally, 16 tenants are now importing recording data into GTM Meetings (all customers have calendar data already flowing to GTM Meetings). Use case documentation started to ensure all ZI teams comply with new deadline of Jan 31, 2026 to read CRM and Engagement data only from GTM DM via API. Additionally, HPE feedback highlighting features we must introduce into new products around RBAC and Credit charging simplification.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Prateek Paikray delivered comprehensive Agentforce capabilities including functionality, training materials, and documentation for Dreamforce presentation. This complete package positions ZoomInfo to showcase enterprise AI capabilities at the industry\'s premier event, demonstrating our platform\'s readiness for large-scale customer adoption and partner engagement.

Sanyog Rai completed a working frontend prototype specifically for customer self-service configuration of GTM Engagement-sourced Account, Contact, and Account Team Role record creation. This targeted solution addresses customer requests for direct control over engagement data integration workflows, with recordings functionality on for 16 tenants and expected to fully deploy pending final approvals next week.

The team initiated comprehensive use case documentation to prepare for the January 31, 2026 compliance deadline requiring all ZoomInfo teams to access CRM and Engagement data exclusively through GTM Data Manager APIs. This foundational work ensures smooth transition away from legacy data access patterns while maintaining operational continuity across the organization.

**Goals & Progress**

**GTM AI Context Service:** Prateek Paikray achieved complete delivery of Agentforce functionality, training materials, and Dreamforce presentation assets, exceeding H2 objectives by providing a comprehensive enablement package. This milestone creates significant opportunity for ZoomInfo to demonstrate AI leadership at the industry\'s most visible platform event.

**GTM Platform & GTM Studio:** Sanyog Rai\'s frontend prototype specifically targets GTM Engagement-sourced record creation workflows that customers need for Account, Contact, and Account Team Role management. The auto-custom-field creation POC advances despite tool integration obstacles, while use case documentation begins addressing the organization-wide compliance requirements for API-only data access.

**Strategic Challenges**

Agentic Team (shoutout Ryan Stevens) are extremely responsive and always available for help, but working with the agentic platform has been difficult to troubleshoot hallucination issues and API tool call failures, even once onboarded to the LangSmith debugging terminal.

Legacy product support issues and limitations driving dozens of implementation projects where customers are turning off data access (Zoom going to turn on CRM Import, but limit objects) and HPE turning off Opportunities). Lots of time spent solving for enterprise use cases with products that were not enterprise-optimized is creating a drain on product management capacity.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

HPE customer feedback is driving new product feature requirements around Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and credit charging simplification that must be built into upcoming product releases. These aren\'t fixes to existing limitations but new capabilities that enterprise customers require for successful platform adoption, requiring careful product roadmap integration and resource allocation.

The January 31, 2026 compliance deadline for GTM Data Manager API-only access represents a fundamental shift in how ZoomInfo teams consume CRM and Engagement data. Early documentation efforts reveal the complexity of migrating existing workflows and the need for comprehensive change management across product, engineering, and customer-facing teams.

Customer self-service configuration capabilities for GTM Engagement-sourced data workflows address specific pain points in Account, Contact, and Account Team Role management. Sanyog Rai\'s prototype demonstrates that targeted automation reduces operational overhead while giving customers direct control over their data integration processes.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our partnership with the Agentic Platform team remains essential for resolving tool integration debugging challenges in GTM Studio field mapping agent. The current API tracing limitations require dedicated technical collaboration to establish proper error visibility and resolution protocols.

The organization-wide shift to GTM Data Model API-only access by January 31, 2026 requires coordination across product, engineering, and operations teams. Use case documentation efforts must accelerate to identify all current data access patterns and plan migration strategies for each affected workflow.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on advancing GTM Data Manager field agent capabilities while establishing Partner OEM WebResearch timelines with Carlos and developing deprecation strategies for legacy data access methods in preparation for the January 2026 compliance deadline.

Sanyog Rai will advance Account Creation work following successful frontend prototype reviews with platform leadership, while the team accelerates use case documentation to support organization-wide API migration planning. Priority includes defining new RBAC and credit management features that HPE feedback indicates are essential for enterprise product adoption.

The Integrations team demonstrates strong execution with Prateek Paikray\'s comprehensive Dreamforce deliverables and Sanyog Rai\'s targeted self-service capabilities, while taking on the significant responsibility of leading organization-wide compliance preparation for the fundamental shift in data access architecture.

## **MCP Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The contact research tool achieved production deployment this week with comprehensive observability infrastructure in place. Carter completed critical concurrency testing showing stable 20-35 second response times under 10 concurrent loads, resolving blocking issues that had been affecting the agent team. The team identified two strategic gaps requiring attention before the November gateway launch: GTM store calendar integration needs participant-based meeting lookup (not just creator-based), and all CPA tools require corresponding API endpoints that don\'t yet exist.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Carter shipped the contact research tool to production with full token counting instrumentation, enabling the team to finally measure actual LLM costs across different tool descriptions and data volumes. The observability work culminated in end-to-end request tracing that can track a single user\'s journey through the entire system even under concurrent load---a capability that was previously impossible and blocked production readiness.

Topher implemented Launch Darkly feature flagging and consolidated logging infrastructure, transforming previously uninformative log lines into actionable traces with user, tenant, and trace ID context. This work directly supports the dreamforce rollout by giving the team visibility into any issues that surface during live demos.

Zheng completed part of the OAuth flow for MCP gateway and deployed the dreamforce cohort feature flag to production, giving select users access to all existing API tools plus the new company research capabilities. He\'s now positioned to verify API credit allocations before demos begin, preventing the embarrassing scenario of reps running out of credits mid-presentation.

**Goals & Progress**

**Contact Research Tool Hardening:** The tool moved through staging to production with comprehensive testing. Carter\'s concurrency analysis demonstrated stable performance under realistic load conditions, with all 10 concurrent requests completing successfully within acceptable timeframes. The semantic data agent integration now includes proper isolation and tracing, resolving issues that had been blocking the agent team\'s work.

**Observability Infrastructure:** The team transformed logging and monitoring capabilities this week. What started as disconnected log entries now provides complete request lifecycle visibility with trace IDs, user context, and tenant information. Carter expanded the existing dashboard framework to capture tool-level performance metrics, setting up the foundation for identifying slow requests programmatically rather than through user complaints.

**Dreamforce Preparation:** Zheng deployed production feature flags for the dreamforce cohort and is adding the research contact tool to their available toolkit. The team identified that credit verification needs to happen next week to ensure demo accounts have sufficient bulk/enrich credits. Topher flagged critical GTM store gaps around meeting participant lookups that need addressing before broader rollout.

**Strategic Challenges**

The GTM store calendar integration currently returns only meetings a user created, not meetings they\'re participating in. This fundamentally breaks the \"what meetings do I have this week?\" use case that reps will expect to work. The GTM store team is aware, but this needs concrete timeline commitment and testing before the gateway launch. The gap affects basic functionality that users will immediately notice.

Platform-first architecture requires that every CPA tool have a corresponding API endpoint, but several current tools lack this. The work needs scheduling between now and mid-November launch, requiring coordination with the API team for onboarding, testing, and spec compliance. This isn\'t urgent but is blocking for gateway production readiness.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Token counting instrumentation revealed that the team has been operating blind on actual LLM costs. Different tool descriptions likely have dramatically different cost profiles---filings or product reviews could consume massive context windows with no warning to users. The dashboards Carter is building will finally provide standard deviation and distribution data, enabling informed decisions about which descriptions to optimize first.

The concurrency testing validated that recent architecture changes resolved the stateful bottleneck issues. However, Carter identified technical reasons why the team isn\'t ready for stateless architecture despite the temptation to pursue it. Ryan Stevens aligned on staying stateful for now, showing good architectural restraint rather than premature optimization.

Early rep feedback from dreamforce preparation shows excitement about combining the research tools with industry research, even though reps are being asked to learn significantly more about a more complicated product (Co-Pilot workspace). The fact that our tools are generating this level of interest despite being the \"simpler\" product signals strong market fit.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

GTM store engineering owns the calendar integration gap. Rowan flagged this in the Friday meeting and will re-ping them next week for timeline commitment. The engagement team\'s work on multi-system support (Chorus, Gong, Zoom) needs resolution before semantic data citations can properly reconstruct URLs---this affects the user experience of following up on conversation intelligence results.

The session with Adam Smith\'s intelligence team on context service positioning is yielding clearer external messaging. Moving away from internal jargon like \"semantic data agent\" toward rep-friendly language will be critical for November launch success. The intelligence team is also exploring exposure of lookalike models as utility tools rather than pure data retrieval.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on dreamforce readiness verification and expanding observability for proactive issue detection. Any feedback from the dreamforce cohort takes immediate priority as the team validates the tool set under real usage conditions.

Carter is building out high-level observability dashboards to complement the low-level tracing work---specifically programmatic identification of slow tool requests and statistical analysis of performance patterns. He\'s also beginning semantic data citations work, though this won\'t be needed for dreamforce since it\'s not in that flow. Topher will prepare PRs for the GTM store calendar improvements even if the underlying data isn\'t ready, positioning the team to ship immediately when dependencies clear. Zheng is verifying API credit allocations for demo accounts and coordinating with the API team on the roadmap for creating endpoints corresponding to existing CPA tools.

The team is well-positioned for dreamforce with production-ready tooling and comprehensive observability. The identified gaps around GTM store integration and API coverage are known quantities that can be systematically addressed in the November timeline.

## **Semantic Data Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Danny Pan\'s team established a clear path from current 24-hour refresh cycles to 1-hour turnaround by the end of next week through ZDP copy append mode implementation. The infrastructure work positions the team to begin GTM store ingestion next week while Jon Seller\'s entity resolution correction script reaches deployment readiness. Resource constraints emerged as a significant headwind, with Christian unavailable for evaluation support and DevOps returning to secondary support status, creating velocity risks that require immediate attention.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Danny Pan completed the technical design for ZDP copy append mode migration, conducting detailed planning sessions with Ilho to map the configuration changes needed on their side. The approach eliminates dependency on ZDP releases and requires only directory cleanup on the team\'s end before testing in stage environment. Early next week should see the 4-hour refresh capability live, with batch embeddings work following immediately after to reach the 1-hour target by week\'s end.

Jon Seller advanced the fragmented people correction script to deployment-ready status after intensive code review cycles that addressed data integrity risks. The script now processes week-long batches in 20 minutes and outputs comprehensive analysis data to Google Drive for validation. This foundational work clears the path for confident tenant ingestion and establishes the pattern for ongoing data quality improvements.

Matt Kowalczyk shipped Airflow Slack notifications to the team channel, providing real-time visibility into pipeline execution. The infrastructure orchestration layer continues maturing with progress on ZDP copy implementation, though BigQuery permissions remain blocked. Matt discovered Airflow\'s native secrets management capability, providing a workaround for the Google Secrets access limitation and unblocking immediate development needs.

**Goals & Progress**

**Data Pipeline Performance:** The append mode architecture provides the foundation for real-time ingestion through Kafka queue integration. Rather than waiting for complete dataset snapshots, records flow directly into tables with merge scripts resolving updates every 30 minutes. This creates a brief window where duplicate records appear in queries, but vector search operations remain unaffected. The team continues evaluating which retrieval patterns can tolerate the temporary duplication versus those requiring immediate consistency. The parallel track on batch embeddings optimization will compound these improvements, delivering the full 1-hour refresh capability that enables meaningful real-time use cases.

**Model Evaluation Quality:** Inga Isakov processed 7 of 10 target calls in the Sonnet 4.5 versus 3.7 comparison, establishing that both models exhibit similar hallucination patterns and entity miss rates. The evaluation methodology involves listening to full recordings and comparing extracted entities against both transcript and audio content, providing ground truth validation. Her analysis surfaced a systematic issue where both models fail to capture account information and call participants despite their presence in recordings, leading to her recommendation to hard-code these critical entities rather than relying on extraction. The team recognizes that manual evaluation of 10 recordings per model iteration creates an unsustainable bottleneck, requiring development of automated evaluation infrastructure to maintain iteration velocity as the system scales.

**Entity Resolution Foundation:** Jon Seller\'s correction script matured through multiple review cycles that systematically addressed the substantial risk of making incorrect merges that could cascade into larger data quality problems. The validation approach uses historical problematic accounts as test cases, proving the correction logic handles edge cases appropriately. The script\'s output provides audit trails and candidate analysis that enable ongoing refinement. With Danny Pan identifying a straightforward path forward in their offline discussion, the first-phase fragmented people fix should complete early next week, unblocking the broader entity resolution roadmap while establishing confidence in the correction methodology.

**Strategic Challenges**

Resource allocation constraints emerged as a material blocker this week, with explicit instruction not to engage Christian for evaluation support while DevOps support reverted to secondary tier following Jimmy\'s reassignment. The team\'s current staffing cannot sustain both infrastructure migrations and the intensive evaluation work required for model improvements, creating a forced prioritization that delays either data quality initiatives or architectural advancement. Inga\'s manual evaluation of individual recordings provides essential validation but cannot scale to the iteration frequency needed for rapid model refinement, particularly as the team expands beyond the current 10-recording sample size.

Matt Kowalczyk remains blocked on BigQuery permissions required for ZDP copy operations, with DevOps response times extending development cycles. While workarounds exist for some infrastructure needs---such as Airflow\'s native secrets management replacing Google Secrets access---the fundamental permissions for data access operations require DevOps intervention. The team discovered that requesting Yasin directly for secret injection bypasses some approval delays, though this tactical solution doesn\'t address the broader permissions architecture that continues creating friction across multiple workstreams.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The append mode architecture investigation revealed that GTM store\'s BigQuery backend currently lacks vector search support because they\'re routing all queries through GraphQL. This creates a potential intermediate state where the team maintains dual write paths---pushing data to both ZDB and GTM store---until GTM store can support vector operations on their BigQuery instance. Danny Pan\'s analysis identified that regardless of the final GTM store integration approach, the team will require vector search capabilities in BigQuery for the foreseeable future, making the append mode optimization valuable independent of the broader architectural evolution.

Inga\'s systematic evaluation process exposed that entity extraction failures often occur for the most fundamental data elements---the companies and people actually participating in conversations. Both Sonnet 4.5 and 3.7 models miss these entities with surprising frequency despite their explicit presence in transcripts and audio. This pattern suggests that additional prompt engineering or structural changes to how participant metadata flows into the extraction process could yield more significant quality improvements than model version upgrades. The recommendation to hard-code account and participant information acknowledges that some context shouldn\'t require extraction at all, particularly when it\'s available as structured metadata from the source systems.

Matt\'s investigation into secrets management revealed organizational infrastructure patterns that aren\'t immediately obvious---ZDP Airflow uses Google Secrets despite the team lacking direct access, DevOps directs teams toward Keyless integration without addressing the authentication bootstrap problem, and Airflow contains native capabilities that duplicate external services. These discoveries highlight the importance of exploring platform features thoroughly before introducing additional integration points, as the team often has more capability at hand than the recommended workflow patterns suggest.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The team\'s work with GTM store engineering on schema finalization and append mode configuration creates a critical dependency for achieving the targeted refresh performance. Ilho\'s responsiveness this week enabled rapid progress on the technical design, and the configuration change coordination scheduled for early next week will determine whether the 4-hour refresh target ships on schedule. Jon received the GraphQL documentation needed to begin GTM store ingestion implementation, removing the information blocker that previously prevented starting this architectural shift.

DevOps relationships require strengthening given the team\'s increased infrastructure needs. The secondary support tier status creates unpredictable delays on permissions, deployments, and configuration changes that compound across multiple team members\' work. While tactical workarounds like direct Yasin engagement for specific requests provide temporary relief, the team needs restored primary support tier access to maintain the velocity required for their current roadmap commitments.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week represents a pivotal shift from infrastructure preparation to production deployment, with three parallel tracks advancing simultaneously. Danny Pan will push the append mode implementation through stage testing and into production, delivering the 4-hour refresh capability while immediately beginning batch embeddings optimization work to reach the 1-hour target. Jon Seller transitions from entity resolution cleanup to GTM store ingestion implementation now that he has the necessary GraphQL documentation, establishing the foundation for deprecating Chorus API dependencies.

The team welcomes Sai to the roster with an onboarding session scheduled before Monday\'s kickoff call. Rowan will provide historical context and current state overview to accelerate his integration into the team\'s workflow. Inga will complete her remaining 3 call evaluations while the team develops the automated evaluation infrastructure needed to scale beyond manual processes. Matt continues advancing the orchestration layer with log tracing support and context manager fixes alongside Danny\'s work to configure production ETL runs in Airflow.

The fragmented people correction script ships early in the week following Jon and Danny\'s offline resolution of the validation approach, clearing the way for confident tenant ingestion. Email engagement functionality awaits only the Gemini key provisioning in Achilles, which Segev typically handles during Sunday maintenance windows. The convergence of these workstreams---faster refresh cycles, GTM store ingestion, cleaned entity data, and email engagement support---compounds into a materially improved data foundation that enables the next phase of product capabilities.

## **Product Ops Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team made progress this week with Sam Darcy integrating the Voice of Customer tool with the microapp chatbot for easier access and integration with other tools in chat. Simultaneously, Ken Elwell and Daniel Kong made significant progress on the Copilot Workspace content creation system, building out the end-to-end process and agent that will allow product marketers and enablement teams to self-serve content without repeatedly pulling PMs away from building. The team is ready to begin rollout to PMs next week, though we\'ve identified that the knowledge graph\'s traversal logic needs refinement after initial testing showed the simpler agent outperforming the graph-based approach. Caleb Munson has begun structuring the annual planning process with fresh eyes, creating clearer documentation and identifying where we\'ve historically struggled with execution follow-through rather than initial strategy setting.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Ken Elwell created a working Copilot Workspace content agent that successfully produced a sales talk track matching our actual output, requiring zero prompting beyond specifying the asset type. This validates the core concept and demonstrates that the system can work with the right inputs. Ken built the agent using three foundational documents that serve as lightweight knowledge graphs: positioning and framing, product capabilities, and competitive landscape. This proves the viability of the approach before scaling to the more complex graph structure.

Daniel Kong built out the complete process for updating the product knowledge base, working through real examples rather than theory to expose gaps in how knowledge creators would actually use the system. He secured alignment from Katie and AJ to proceed with the rollout, and has the agents ready to refresh and prune the knowledge base. Daniel\'s work on the knowledge creator side of the system complements Ken\'s content generation work, creating the full loop of how product information flows into usable assets.

Sam Darcy integrated the Voice of Customer tool with the microapp chatbot, making it accessible within chat for easier integration with other tools. This initial version provides the foundation for continued iteration on data quality and feature development.

**Goals & Progress**

**Copilot Workspace Launch Infrastructure:** The team is positioned to roll out the content creation system to PMs next week, starting with a meeting with Victor\'s team on Tuesday. Ken, Daniel, and Brett have aligned on the knowledge creator workflow and are finalizing the content creator rollout strategy, deciding whether to launch broadly or test with a smaller group first. The system will serve as a pilot for understanding how teams will contribute to and extract value from a knowledge graph at scale, informing the longer-term architecture.

**Knowledge Graph Development:** Initial testing revealed that the first knowledge graph implementation produced weaker outputs than the simpler agent approach, which Ken expected given it was the very first test. The team identified three potential causes for the performance gap: document quality, system prompt configuration, or traversal logic. Brett and Sam both believe the traversal mechanism is the key differentiator and likely culprit, as the default graph traversal from the graffiti library may not be sufficient for this use case. The challenge is that Sam needs to focus on VOC work and can only serve as an advisor rather than an implementer on the knowledge graph refinement.

**Annual Planning Process Design:** Caleb Munson reviewed all past annual planning documentation and created a high-level process overview with clearer definitions of commonly used terms, addressing what he observed as \"inside baseball\" documentation that assumed too much context. He synthesized the five different names teams had used for the same planning artifacts and established consistent nomenclature. Brett acknowledged that past planning cycles were \"average at best\" due to bandwidth constraints, noting the team has historically done well with initial strategy setting and the director-level planning responses, but has never developed strong execution and adjustment processes after plans are set. Caleb plans to kick off the next cycle mid-November with an eight-week timeline, though he flagged concern about layering this heavy lift onto the existing \"mad scramble\" of Q4 milestones.

**Strategic Challenges**

The knowledge graph work faces a resource constraint that could slow progress at a moment when momentum matters. Sam\'s expertise in building the advanced traversal logic would be valuable, but he\'s rightfully focused on the VOC tool work that Dominik is requesting. Ken could experiment with implementing traversal improvements on a branch using the old knowledge graph code as reference, but there\'s risk of breaking existing functionality or getting confused by deprecated concepts. The team needs to decide whether to accept slower iteration on the knowledge graph enhancement or find another path forward that doesn\'t depend on Sam as an implementer.

Rolling out the Copilot Workspace system requires coordinating with launch operations team members who need to review and help administer the new process. Brett identified this as a blocker, noting the system is ready from a technical standpoint but needs operational buy-in and support infrastructure. The broader question is how to scale this across content creators beyond the initial pilot, balancing the desire to move quickly with the need to ensure teams understand how to use the system effectively.

Caleb raised a pattern he\'s observing after his first month: there are frequent discussions across teams about plans, dependencies, and what each team is doing. He\'s uncertain whether this represents healthy continuous planning where teams don\'t wait 90 days to adjust course, or whether it signals insufficient context-setting that leaves people unclear on their priorities. This ambiguity matters as the team designs the next planning cycle, particularly the balance between providing rich strategic context upfront versus enabling lightweight ongoing adjustments. Brett noted this deserves deeper exploration when Kristin Gandini returns.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Ken\'s testing revealed that taking a real use case and building it live accelerates learning dramatically compared to theoretical planning. The Copilot Workspace example forced the team to work through actual workflows and edge cases, making it clear what documentation structure is needed and where gaps exist. Brett echoed this insight, noting the team keeps relearning that jumping into live use cases is the fastest path to clarity, though the thinking often circles back to the same conclusions. The implication is to default to rapid prototyping with real scenarios rather than extensive upfront design.

Daniel\'s experience walking through a single example end-to-end exposed how much more comprehensive the process documentation needs to be beyond just explaining how the system works technically. Users need clear guidance on when to update information, what format to use, how to handle edge cases, and how to verify their contributions were processed correctly. This suggests the team should build process scaffolding alongside any new tools rather than treating it as a later addition.

The first knowledge graph test provides valuable signal despite poor results. The team hypothesizes that product marketing use cases may need explicit top-down framing built into the knowledge graph to guide navigation, rather than relying on the agent to discover relevant connections through general traversal. This would be a significant architectural insight if validated, suggesting different use cases may require different graph structures or navigation strategies.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our rollout of the Copilot Workspace system depends on coordination with Katie and the launch operations team to review processes and determine how to administer the new workflow. Brett is working to establish clearer collaboration between PMs and customer experience teams during the release process, specifically getting CX to engage earlier on customer impact rather than consuming information only when releases are final. This connects to the broader MCR improvements and represents a shift toward AI-first release coordination that could reduce last-minute scrambles.

Sam\'s VOC work includes a specific request from Dominik for next week. Guy and Dominik have been identified as potential resources for helping remove blockers on VOC infrastructure and deployment needs.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week centers on executing the Copilot Workspace rollout while beginning to gather real-world feedback on both the content creation process and the underlying knowledge management approach. The team will shift from building to learning mode, watching how PMs actually interact with the system and where friction appears.

Ken, Daniel, and Brett will facilitate the rollout to Victor\'s PM team on Tuesday, with particular attention to the knowledge creator workflow where PMs update product information. This first wave of users will reveal whether the process documentation is clear enough and whether the agents successfully maintain knowledge base quality. Simultaneously, the team needs to finalize the content creator rollout strategy, determining whether to bring in all marketing and enablement team members at once or start with a smaller test group. Success here means proving that non-experts can generate high-quality assets without PM involvement, freeing product teams to focus on building. Sam will dedicate time to the VOC data quality improvements Dominik requested while continuing to bring the microapp version to feature parity with the original custom tool. Caleb will engage Sarah Heritage in the annual planning feedback process and begin scoping a change management plan that acknowledges the organization\'s limited capacity for simultaneous changes.

The team has built significant momentum across multiple fronts this week, validating core technical approaches while identifying the specific areas that need refinement. The shift to real-world testing next week will determine how well the theoretical designs hold up under actual use and inform the next iteration of both the Copilot Workspace system and the broader knowledge graph strategy.

## **Product BI Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team achieved a significant breakthrough this week on event instrumentation governance. Phoebe Mei secured alignment with Sean and Adam on requiring analytics requirement tickets for every new feature launch, ensuring event tracking is reviewed before features go live. This addresses a longstanding gap where engineering teams shipped features without proper instrumentation. We will need to see events released moving forward actually have the right instrumentation and eventing. Meanwhile, the team is shifting its workspace analysis approach based on insights from session recordings, which revealed that traditional event metrics miss the story of user confusion and unsuccessful attempts - a more valuable signal than raw engagement numbers at this early stage.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Phoebe Mei established a concrete process improvement with Sean and Adam to close event instrumentation gaps. Going forward, every new feature will require a Jira analytics ticket reviewed by the BI team before launch, with engineering teams coordinating through Sean and Adam to assign implementation owners. For existing gaps, Phoebe will flag missing events in the channel with Sean and Adam to coordinate engineering resources.

Inbal Kor completed the unified tracking infrastructure for GTM Copilot Workspace, merging backend and frontend data into a single source. She also created a new dashboard tracking the GTM Studio signal feature (which allows users to create worksheets and enrich columns using signals) and successfully coached Ferrell Tanuwidjaja on building GTM Studio taxonomies independently, expanding the team\'s capacity.

The team made progress on taxonomy adoption, sharing the standardized event naming documentation with engineering teams including Sean and Ars. While new events using the taxonomy are currently in staging (not yet in production), the framework is now established for the share view feature and future launches.

**Goals & Progress**

**Event Instrumentation & Taxonomy:** The team established mandatory analytics review for all feature launches through required Jira tickets, with engineering coordination through Sean and Adam. The taxonomy documentation has been shared with engineering teams and is being applied to new features like share view, though implementation is still in staging. Phoebe continues requiring extensive follow-up to ensure adoption, but the structural process improvement should reduce this burden going forward. For now, BI is doing a lot of handholding with eng but we can\'t continue this forever. So if the issue is not fixed soon then we will need to escalate up through eng leadership.

**Workspace Analysis & Adoption:** AJ Belen and Victor shifted the analysis strategy after reviewing session recordings in the Steerco meeting. Reviewed a handful of session recordings, so may not be fully representative. They discovered that users showing high engagement metrics were actually struggling and unsuccessful - clicking multiple filters, trying six different approaches, but never accomplishing their goal (specifically around Salesforce integration). This insight revealed that traditional event analysis and dashboards miss the context of user confusion, leading to a decision to prioritize collaborative session recording reviews over dashboard development at this stage.

**GTM Studio Instrumentation:** Inbal Kor implemented tracking for the new signal data source feature and added it to the high-level engagement dashboard. Ferrell Tanuwidjaja reviewed general enrichment and signal events for GTM Studios, compared amplitude and snowflake data sources, and is moving to the workbook landing page review before meeting with stakeholders on priority business questions and event taxonomy best practices.

**Strategic Challenges**

The team faces a fundamental tension between building comprehensive dashboards and metrics versus conducting qualitative session analysis. AJ Belen determined that Phoebe should not invest a lot of time analyzing drop-offs, retention rates, or building sophisticated reports while the product is still in early stages with fundamental workflow issues. The crawl-walk-run analogy applies: these reports are for when the product is walking or running, but right now it\'s still crawling. However, this creates ambiguity since Sean and Adam may not share this perspective, requiring alignment next week.

Session recording analysis requires collaborative review sessions rather than independent work. AJ Belen acknowledged he lacks the full product context to extract sophisticated insights alone, and similarly Phoebe needs to conduct multiple sessions with Sean and Victor before she can effectively review recordings independently. This group dependency creates a capacity constraint, though it accelerates learning through Sean\'s product expertise that wouldn\'t be captured otherwise.

The entitlement table for external launch preparation is still in early discussion phase. Phoebe is initiating channel conversations to pull in partner teams and create a list of external users who will receive workspace access, but this cross-functional coordination is just beginning.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Session recordings revealed a disconnect between engagement metrics and actual user success. Users appearing highly engaged by traditional measures were actually confused and unsuccessful, triggering multiple events while attempting a single task they never completed. Watching users click through six different filters trying to accomplish one Salesforce integration task showed that raw event counts mask the true user experience. This fundamentally questions the value of dashboard analysis at this product maturity stage.

Taxonomy adoption requires structural process changes, not just documentation sharing. Despite sharing the standardized event naming framework with engineering teams, adoption remains slow and requires constant follow-up from Phoebe. The solution - mandatory analytics Jira tickets reviewed before feature launch - shifts this from a voluntary best practice to a required checkpoint. This represents a maturation in how analytics integrates with the product development process.

Close collaboration between product managers, analysts, and engineers creates exponentially better insights than individual review. The Steerco session where AJ Belen, Victor, and Sean reviewed recordings together surfaced insights none would have caught alone - Sean recognized product nuances, Victor contributed analytical perspective, and AJ Belen asked questions from a business angle. Inbal Kor\'s experience this week reinforced this, noting that early alignment between product managers and engineers on taxonomy and dashboards ensures the data directly answers business questions and builds confidence in the tracking setup.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The team\'s work with Sean and Adam on event instrumentation governance continues to be essential for ensuring analytics can effectively track product usage. The newly established process requiring analytics Jira tickets for feature launches formalizes this dependency and should reduce friction, though it requires buy-in from engineering teams and TPM coordination to enforce consistently.

Victor\'s alignment on the session recording approach versus dashboard development represents an important partnership. However, Sean and Adam may not share this perspective on deprioritizing sophisticated analytics in favor of qualitative research, requiring a conversation next week to ensure the team\'s focus aligns with product leadership expectations.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on operationalizing the new event instrumentation governance process while continuing qualitative workspace analysis through session recordings. The team needs to balance maintaining the infrastructure work (taxonomy documentation, fixing existing event gaps) with the higher-value insight generation from collaborative user research.

Phoebe Mei will likely spend significant time on session recording reviews with Sean and Victor rather than independent dashboard analysis, continuing to build product context before she can effectively conduct this work independently. She\'ll also drive the entitlement table conversation forward with partner teams to prepare for external launch. Ferrell Tanuwidjaja will complete the workbook landing page review and meet with stakeholders to align on priority business questions and taxonomy best practices. Inbal Kor will continue GTM Studio work, though Yuan will be out Wednesday for Israeli holidays.

The team needs to confirm with Sean and Adam next week that the shift away from sophisticated retention and drop-off analysis aligns with their expectations, ensuring everyone agrees that collaborative session recording reviews deliver more value at this product stage. This conversation will clarify whether the current approach is temporary or represents a longer-term analytical philosophy for early-stage products.

## **Automation Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Engineering decision to adopt DoubleO stack over ZoomInfo Workflows forces comprehensive roadmap reassessment. The team completed all weekly goals but faces fundamental strategic shifts. Adam Peretz identified limitations in data analytics capabilities, discovering that the data team no longer has capacity to support pipeline development, forcing workarounds that won\'t scale. Marc Frail delivered a smart builder prototype that raises versioning and packaging questions requiring deeper platform integration investigation.

**This Week\'s Progress**

Sam Massie delivered flexible trigger UI approach and enterprise requirements analysis, completing exploration of enterprise customer needs including IBM requirements. The work identified that org-wide rules, auditability, traceability, and consistency are essential for enterprise trust and retention.

**Goals & Progress**

**Smart Builder Development:** Marc Frail completed 100% of POC creation, producing a reviewable prototype that demonstrates automated data connector action generation.

**Documentation Enhancement:** Adam Peretz completed 100% of feedback incorporation planning, creating fully detailed and prioritized tickets that translate leadership input into actionable engineering work. The systematic approach ensures customer integration timelines and friction will be reduced.

**Enterprise Governance Exploration:** Sam Massie completed flexible trigger UI decisions and enterprise requirements investigation, identifying governance capabilities needed for 2026 roadmap to retain and grow strategic customer segment.

**Strategic Challenges**

DoubleO stack adoption forces roadmap reconsideration, with Sam Massie noting that the engineering decision to use DoubleO over ZoomInfo Workflows requires revisiting the entire H2 roadmap. This strategic pivot creates uncertainty about planned deliverables and timelines while potentially offering longer-term platform advantages.

Data pipeline ownership gap threatens analytics capabilities, as Adam Peretz discovered that the data team no longer has capacity to support additional Snowflake pipelines. The automation team lacks expertise and capacity to own data pipeline infrastructure, forcing reliance on workarounds through auth claims and ZDP that won\'t scale to future analytics needs.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Enterprise governance requirements differ fundamentally from SMB needs, as Sam Massie discovered through IBM and other enterprise customer analysis. Org-wide policies, auditability, traceability, and consistency become table stakes for enterprise segments, requiring different product capabilities than those prioritized for smaller customers.

Infrastructure capacity constraints create technical debt accumulation, with Adam Peretz identifying that the diminished data team capacity forces teams to either develop expertise in adjacent technology stacks or accept workarounds that don\'t scale. This represents broader organizational infrastructure challenges beyond automation team scope.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

DoubleO team coordination becomes essential for roadmap alignment, with Marc Frail planning deeper dives into how Workflows and DoubleO roadmaps integrate and how triggers and actions will be consumed within the new platform architecture.

Analytics and dashboard teams require coordination for Adam Peretz\'s workaround validation, ensuring that auth claims and ZDP approach meets reporting needs despite inability to access Snowflake pipeline development capacity.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on understanding DoubleO integration while validating data analytics workarounds and advancing platform integration investigations.

Marc Frail will conduct deeper investigation into Workflows versus DoubleO roadmap alignment and explore how ZoomInfo triggers and actions will be consumed within the DoubleO platform. This strategic work is essential for understanding execution paths following the engineering decision to adopt DoubleO stack.

Adam Peretz will confirm that the proposed strategy for storing key data elements in ZDP for reporting and analytics actually works, while revisiting the list of required data to ensure comprehensive coverage. Sam Massie will align roadmap planning to DoubleO roadmap requirements, translating enterprise governance insights into the new platform context.

## **User Provisioning Team Weekly Report - October 6-10, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The Provisioning team achieved successful go-live this week for AI Action Credit usage reporting into SAP, supporting the migration of GTM Studio Early Access (EA) customers and enabling general availability of AI credits. The team is now monitoring the production environment and beginning work to ensure AI usage margin aligns with the 30-40% business target set by leadership.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

The highest leverage achievement this week was the successful go-live of AI Action Credit reporting into SAP, confirming the technical foundation needed to support GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace customers. This validation represents a monumental step for the monetization strategy of AI features.

The team successfully transitioned from development and testing into live production environment, with all systems operational and usage accurately reporting to SAP for billing purposes.

**Goals & Progress**

**AI Action Credit Go-Live:** The team achieved the October 8th go-live milestone for AI Action Credits for GTM Studio EA and Copilot Workspace customers. This pivotal moment transitioned from development and testing into a live production environment, enabling proper monetization of AI features.

**Post-Launch Monitoring:** The team is now closely monitoring the production environment to ensure stable operation and accurate usage reporting. Initial observations show the system is performing as expected with usage data flowing correctly to SAP.

**Strategic Challenges**

The subsequent priority is an immediate financial review to ensure that the net margin across AI usage aligns with the 30-40% target set by the business. This involves meeting with key stakeholders, including Adam Smith and Mark Harris, to review the namespaces, markup, and weighted usage of AI to lock in the target margin before customers begin consuming the credits at scale.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The successful go-live demonstrated the value of intense cross-functional collaboration, with the team working late nights and early mornings over the past few weeks to meet the October 8th deadline. Jessie Lindstrom commended the entire team for embodying the \"be relentless\" value.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with GTM Tech and RevOps continues to be essential for packaging and pricing coordination, though the successful launch has validated the technical implementation. Ongoing collaboration with Adam Smith\'s team will be critical for ensuring margin targets are achieved.

**Looking Ahead**

The primary focus for next week is the financial review to ensure that the net margin across AI usage aligns with the 30-40% target. This involves meeting with key stakeholders to review namespaces, markup, and weighted usage of AI to lock in the target margin.

The team remains committed to principles of strong internal partnership and relentless execution to ensure the long-term monetization and success of ZoomInfo\'s AI-driven products.
