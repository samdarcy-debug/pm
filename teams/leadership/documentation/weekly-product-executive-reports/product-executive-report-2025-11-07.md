|                                                 | **SalesOS/Copilot Team:** Resource contention between short-term UX fixes and GTM Data Model migration is creating difficult prioritization decisions. Temporary improvements to address current direct/API SFDC integration limitations are absorbing significant capacity from the same senior engineers needed for GTM Data Model work.                                                                                         |

| **Data Quality & Pipeline Issues**              | **Semantic Data Team:** Team identified a potential data quality issue where Claude 4.5 may be extracting more entities than currently appear in the knowledge graph. API responses indicate 40 entities and 80 relationships being found, but validation logic prevents storage when the graph structure isn\'t valid, creating a blind spot where apparent volume reduction might actually reflect overly aggressive validation. |

|                                                 | **Data Executive Team:** Waterfall enrichment project needs validation through sample data to ensure correct decisions about which data to return and which to exclude. Engineering teams are already building based on requirements documents, but without concrete examples there\'s risk of misalignment between data layer decisions and downstream product needs.                                                             |

| **Infrastructure & Scalability Challenges**     | **Semantic Data Team:** The 2048-dimension limit in BigQuery\'s vector implementation raises concerns about retrieval quality impacting semantic matching capabilities that drive agent performance. Current multi-cloud architecture creates excessive data movement with cost and latency penalties, with data flowing from BigQuery to Postgres to BigQuery in different projects with multiple cloud transfers in between.     |
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                                                 | **Product Ops Team:** Daniel Kong faces data access dependencies blocking product release automation, with permission access issues preventing downloading needed data from Dan\'s team, and when downloads do work, files sometimes contain only null values. Token limit constraints in VOC agents continue, with Kristin Gandini hitting limits in ZI Chat when trying to run agents with large system prompts.                 |
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                                                 | **ZIM Team:** Workbooks row limitation blockers affect customer export requirements, with Jesse Miller proposing capacity doubling to 400K or preview approach displaying subset while sending full lists to external data sources (LiveRamp, Meta, LinkedIn).                                                                                                                                                                     |
+-------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cross-Team Coordination & Alignment Gaps**    | **Intelligence Team:** The Pulses initiative reveals organizational alignment gaps, with multiple teams developing parallel solutions without a unified architecture. Derek Osgood working on event-based triggers through Blaze, Robyn Sablosky received requirements for recommendation engine, and various product teams conceptualizing Pulses differently across Copilot Workspace, GTM Studio, and other surfaces.           |
|                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                                                 | **Core Data Team:** Release communication issues extend beyond education. John Durst documented instances where stakeholders asked for release notes in the same Slack thread where they were just shared, stating \"entire departments that should know\" about release processes remain unaware despite personal notification.                                                                                                   |

| **Customer-Facing Quality & Enablement Gaps**   | **Intelligence Team:** Hallucination rates in Copilot chat are concerning, with Robyn Sablosky\'s testing revealing approximately one in three interactions producing hallucinated responses. This accuracy issue requires immediate attention as it directly impacts user trust and product reliability.                                                                                                                          |

|                                                 | **PMM Engine Team:** AI Action Credit enablement gap represents a significant missed opportunity. Sales received training on mechanics and pricing but lacks the value positioning, discovery questions, objection handling, and talk tracks needed to confidently sell credits. Enablement considers the work complete, while the field is equipped only for defensive conversations rather than proactive selling.               |

### **Bottom Line**

GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace achieved sales-ready and customer-ready status on November 3rd with 1,000+ sellers now actively demoing to customers, generating strong early traction including \~\$1.7M in pipeline from Alex Lazerovich\'s prospecting day alone. The platform demo is fundamentally shifting customer perception from data provider to comprehensive GTM platform. However, the organization faces critical execution challenges requiring immediate leadership intervention: (1) AI credit enablement gaps where sales understands mechanics but lacks confident value-selling talk tracks despite SurveyMonkey usage suggesting \$700K annual revenue potential, (2) hallucination rates affecting one in three chat interactions requiring evaluation framework access for product teams, (3) systematic resource constraints with Core Data reporting only one-third of actual work represented in weekly goals and senior engineers split between immediate UX fixes and foundational GTM Data Model migration, and (4) organizational alignment gaps on Pulses with multiple teams building parallel solutions without unified architecture. The business is consuming \~140,000 AI credits weekly (\$350K annualized), demonstrating proof of concept but requiring urgent focus on credit consumption reporting and change management to align the organization around this North Star metric for 2026 growth.

### **GTM Studio**

**GTM Studio Team:** \"The November 3rd release went live successfully with Studio and Workspace activation now in production, marking a major milestone as we transition from planning to real-world usage with sellers actively using the product in live prospecting blocks. Workbooks saw strong field adoption with revenue leaders activating custom audiences to their sales teams, though semantic enrichment scalability and data coverage concerns remain open items requiring continued attention through next week. Plays received critical feedback during the week that the DoubleO core user experience needs redesign before customer readiness, prompting a pivot in M2 sequencing to prioritize plays core experience over the original scope, with design workshops scheduled for next week to align on the new direction. ROI Analytics successfully completed GTM Data Store validation in staging with the cutover now targeted for November 13th (delayed by 1-2 days for pre-caching), while Arun finalized the Figma prototype for Milestone 1 instrumentation requirements and began scheduling calls with workspace and agentic chat engineering counterparts to identify gaps. Data Management made strong progress with benchmarks complete for the V2 Data Health Scan ready for circulation to prioritized accounts next week, M3 designs buttoned up with three design partners scheduled for validation, and M5 steel thread narrative complete showing the end-to-end data management flow in GTM Studio with AI onboarding designs kicking off next week.\"

### **GTM Copilot Workspace**

**SalesOS/Copilot Team:** \"Sean Walter delivered a refocused roadmap addressing the GTM Data Model pivot while Adam Severance pushed significant chat accuracy improvements live behind feature flags for 25% of users. Workbook activation has emerged as the most requested demo flow from sales teams, requiring potential scope adjustments as this becomes the primary sales motion. GTM Data Model integration is absorbing capacity from senior engineers who are also critical for chat improvements, creating resource tension that needs resolution. Zero Config progress advanced with Harinath Krishnamoorthy establishing Intent Clusters as the bridge between GTM Offerings and Copilot configuration, while MCP server development for Intent data began to enable both Workspace integration and external LLM access.\"

### **GTM AI Context Service**

**Intelligence Team:** \"The team successfully launched M1 for GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace this week, with both products now live in production. While the rollout went smoothly with no major incidents, immediate focus has shifted to addressing cost optimization and agent accuracy issues that emerged during early customer interactions. Ryan Stevens and Lars Vedo are leading efforts to reduce LLM costs through prompt caching and architectural improvements, while simultaneously working to decrease hallucination rates that currently affect approximately one-third of chat interactions. The team demonstrated strong cross-functional collaboration with design teams to unify chat experiences across products, and initial customer demos are generating significant positive feedback despite some rough edges in the demo path.\"

**MCP Tiger Team:** \"The gateway infrastructure reached a major milestone this week with Carter & Topher completing some of the control plane API endpoints (create, get, and update) and advancing request routing functionality. The team now estimates the control plane at 40-45% complete, with ChatGPT integration demonstrating functional capability despite requiring more prescriptive prompting than Claude. Architecture definition remains fluid as implementation proceeds, creating coordination friction that Vinod and Topher flagged for process improvement.\"

**Semantic Data Team:** \"Venkata completed a comprehensive architecture assessment and proposed a scalable redesign that will cut embedding generation costs by 50% through Anthropic batch API calls and eliminate multi-cloud complexity by consolidating the entire pipeline into GCP. The team is now executing a parallel migration strategy---maintaining current operations while building a more efficient system that reduces data hops and enables GPU-accelerated embedding generation through Vertex AI. This 6-8 sprint initiative positions the semantic data infrastructure for enterprise-scale deployment while Jon and Inga maintain tenant quality during the transition.\"

### **Vertical Datasets**

**Data Executive Team:** \"Dow secured the complete S&P fleet data file and expects delivery to Valvoline by week\'s end despite ongoing legal agreement negotiations, unblocking multiple Q4 opportunities. The franchise webinar drew over 15 external participants including prospects like Toast and customer BBSI, with a \$100K proposal moving forward. These vertical dataset motions are generating substantial pipeline, with the team ending October at over \$2 million in new opportunities.\"

### **Other Data**

**Data Executive Team:** \"Dana\'s team exceeded mobile phone enrichment targets by 45%, successfully attaching 5.5 million ByteMine mobile phones to U.S. contacts against a goal of 5 million---with the full 7.25 million records processed ahead of schedule. This substantial lift in mobile coverage positions the team well for the remaining 99 million ByteMine records awaiting processing. Meanwhile, Dow secured the complete S&P fleet data file and expects delivery to Valvoline by week\'s end despite ongoing legal agreement negotiations, unblocking multiple Q4 opportunities. Engineering teams made solid progress defining Company 3.0 profiler requirements, and Suresh deployed a Contributory Network eligibility agent that consolidates compliance data across multiple Salesforce screens into a single view.\"

**Core Data Team:** \"The Core Data team worked to advance shared services platform alignment while navigating significant challenges in customer education and release communication. Magnus Herweyer pursued completion of a shared services AI data management proposal document, though the actual authoring by technical leads Casey and Michael remained pending due to Studio GA release delays. John Durst exposed systematic gaps in release note adoption, documenting instances where stakeholders asked for release notes in the same Slack thread where they were just shared. Heather Ma finalized the production plan for the Deal Insights Agent with identified dependencies and open questions, while Jody Roberts demonstrated rapid AI prototyping capabilities with an SEC data extraction agent. The team faces mounting pressure to prioritize as Peter Overman reported having \"about a third\" of his actual task list represented in weekly goals.\"

### **Other Platform**

**ZIM Team:** \"November 18th release preparation completed with AI Page Rank and bot filtering documentation, videos, and implementation guides finished while website identity pipeline returns to production with ZI data filtering. Adobe \$8-10M revenue gap requires closure through enhanced ad spend and two-year renewal coordination as team navigates website journey data specification misunderstandings from multiple consuming teams. DMP activation planning advances with tomorrow\'s review meeting while workbooks row limitations identified as blocker requiring 400K capacity doubling.\"

**Integrations Team:** \"Marc Frail achieved production readiness for connector publishing, resolving all blocking issues through coordinated cross-team synchronization and completing end-to-end testing. The work is scheduled for Monday morning production promotion, enabling the 22-connector library to become available as enrichment options supporting GTM Studio GA.\"

**Automation Team:** \"Connector publishing achieves production readiness and function nesting complexity emerges for GTM Plays. Marc Frail completed end-to-end testing of connector publishing flow with production promotion scheduled for Monday morning, following resolution of cross-timezone coordination challenges. Adam Peretz secured leadership approval for API versioning proposal and continues Salesforce partnership negotiations. Sam Massie handed off internal connector requirements to engineering but identified that function nesting will be essential for complex GTM Plays scenarios.\"

**Team Provisioning & Login:** \"The high-leverage goal of cutting over to AI action credits in production was a success, with both internal teams and Early Access (EA) customers now generating actual usage data on the AI platform. The immediate challenge is a security and billing risk identified with the \"login as\" feature, where internal users inadvertently charge customer credit lots after impersonating a customer. Jessie Kain Lindstrom is prioritizing a plan next week to deprecate the current \"login as\" functionality and implement the new admin impersonation feature. Concurrently, Brannen Huske is strategically leveraging the impending 2026 cost increase for Legacy SSO infrastructure to create a pricing \"wedge,\" incentivizing customers to migrate to the newer, more secure infrastructure.\"

### **Other Operations**

**PMM Engine Team:** \"AJ Belen\'s team successfully completed the Go-to-Market Workspace rebrand with all assets updated and deployed to the field this week, including the finalized platform narrative deck that rolled out to sellers. The team is now pivoting to address a significant gap in AI Action Credit enablement: while foundational training on mechanics and pricing has been completed, sales lacks the positioning, talk tracks, and objection handling needed to actually sell credits effectively. Dominik Facher and Victor are escalating this to AR, Tuna, and James to drive urgency, with early signals showing substantial revenue potential---SurveyMonkey\'s usage would extrapolate to \$700K annually, and ZoomInfo\'s internal usage suggests \$350K in incremental revenue.\"

**Product Ops Team:** \"Frustrating week as the team encountered major data & infrastructure blockers this week that delayed the planned VOC tool rollout, automated release details, and analyzing Studio/Workspace calls so far, though viable solutions are now in hand and testing resumes this afternoon. Despite these setbacks, the team shipped some tangible wins: Kristin Gandini launched two major capabilities - the agentic platform prototyping tool for the organization and the automated tech documentation tool for the CX team using Github PRs and Jira ticket info, both now in active use. Ken Elwell had promising success running personalized release communication at scale through GTM Studio and Workspace, though some product gaps to work through. The week showcased the reality of building new things - unexpected technical challenges alongside concrete progress.\"

### **Individual Team Reports**

## **DAI Executive Team Weekly Report - November 3-7, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

GTM Workspace and GTM Studio achieved sales-ready and customer-ready status on November 3rd, marking a pivotal milestone with 1,000+ sellers now actively demoing to customers. Early signals are promising: Alex Lazerovich\'s team generated approximately \$1.7M in pipeline from a single prospecting day, and the platform demo is fundamentally shifting how customers perceive ZoomInfo---from a thin data wrapper to a comprehensive GTM platform. However, the team faces immediate challenges around field enablement gaps, particularly on AI credit positioning where sellers understand mechanics but lack confident talk tracks for customer conversations. The week revealed the business is consuming \~140,000 AI credits weekly (\$7,000/week or \$350,000 annualized), demonstrating proof of concept but requiring urgent focus on credit consumption reporting and change management to align the organization around this new North Star metric.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Victor Oliveros and Sneh Kakileti led their teams through the successful November 3rd launch of sales-ready and customer-ready GTM Workspace and Studio products. The platform demo resonates strongly with customers, with sellers reporting that ZoomInfo is \"no longer just a thin app wrapper around the data moat\" but a comprehensive platform solution. Solution consultants have already booked 47 demos for November, with 8 quotes currently outstanding, indicating strong early traction in the field.

Adam Smith advanced critical infrastructure work by mapping out the pulses and message broker roadmap for November delivery, while simultaneously addressing latency and optimization concerns that are directly impacting user experience. The team identified low-hanging fruit for immediate performance improvements while planning longer-term infrastructure investments, ensuring both near-term wins and sustainable scaling.

Brandon Tucker made progress on waterfall enrichment capabilities, with business email enrichment nearly complete in Solr and mobile phone data work underway. The team identified a path to add approximately 100 million contacts to support improved match rates, though longer-term Solr capacity planning remains a focus area for the upcoming data team onsite.

**Goals & Progress**

**GTM Workspace & Studio Launch:** Victor Oliveros and Sneh Kakileti successfully delivered the November 3rd sales-ready and customer-ready milestone after months of intensive work from product, engineering, and design teams. The field is now actively demoing to customers with visible momentum---Alex Lazerovich\'s prospecting day generated \~\$1.7M in pipeline, and sellers consistently report that customers see the next-generation ZoomInfo vision. November priorities focus on studio-to-workspace integration improvements, next-generation artifacts based on sales use cases, and visible product enhancements to maintain field confidence through the inevitable wins and losses of early customer adoption.

**AI Credits Infrastructure & Adoption:** AJ Belen and the team finalized customer-facing AI action credit assets for both economic buyers and end users, completing the foundation for go-to-market motions. However, a critical gap emerged: while sellers understand the nuts and bolts of packaging through enablement sessions from Adam Smith, Mark Harris, and Jesse Lindstrom, they lack confident talk tracks, objection handling, and simulation-based practice for actual customer conversations. Internal ZoomInfo usage demonstrates the model\'s potential---consuming \~140,000 AI credits weekly (\$350K annualized), which would rank as a top 1,000 customer---but systematic change management and reporting infrastructure are needed to drive this as the company\'s primary growth metric.

**Platform Infrastructure & Performance:** Adam Smith worked with engineering leadership to advance November roadmap items including the A2A message broker for pulses, though resourcing gaps require resolution with Carlos Nunez and Derek in the coming week. The team identified efficiency and optimization as critical for addressing latency concerns---a one-for-one correlation exists between inference optimization and speed. Ryan Stevens and Lars are tackling low-hanging fruit while the team evaluates whether to resource additional work through Nebo\'s team for artifacts, enabling parallel execution streams rather than bottlenecking on the core agentic team.

**Strategic Challenges**

The team identified significant enablement gaps around AI action credits that go beyond asset creation. While foundational understanding exists through recent training sessions, sellers lack the offensive positioning, confident talk tracks, and objection handling capabilities needed for customer conversations. The current approach is overly defensive---focused on concerns about overspending and refund requests rather than selling the transformative value. This gap requires more than documentation; it needs role-playing simulations, team meeting practice, and top-down messaging from sales leadership showing aggressive customer conversations about AI credits, similar to how enterprise software companies transitioned to subscription models.

Resource allocation and team overlap emerged as a concern across multiple workstreams. Dominik Facher noted that multiple engineering teams and PMs are effectively working on similar problems in different directions, particularly around plays and automation capabilities. This creates inefficiency and potential for duplicated effort. The team needs to rationalize resource allocation and ensure clear swim lanes, especially as they transition from chasing individual roadmap items to building sustainable platform primitives.

Data management infrastructure faces scaling challenges as the team accelerates dataset onboarding for GTM Studio. Brandon Tucker discovered that while processes are documented, they require too many handoffs and deep expertise across multiple teams. For the vision of dozens to hundreds of datasets next year, the team must templatize and democratize these processes rather than relying on manual coordination and specialized knowledge. The upcoming data team onsite will focus on converting this from a planning session to a working hackathon to address these bottlenecks.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The platform demo\'s success reveals a fundamental shift in customer perception. When executed well, customers begin pitching the vision back to the team rather than raising objections, and pricing conversations naturally emerge as a next step rather than a barrier. This validates the strategic bet on unified platform positioning over point solutions. However, Victor Oliveros observed that Workspace is evolving into half productivity app and half micro-app delivery channel---views serve as the data source, and artifacts built on top create the \"aha moments\" where customers\' eyes light up. This insight should guide January roadmap prioritization.

The conversational intelligence opportunity with semantic data emerged as a major monetization path through discussions between Adam Smith and Sneh Kakileti. Rather than explaining bike processing to customers, the team can package semantic capabilities as tiered conversational intelligence features in Studio, creating a clearer value proposition and revenue model. This represents a significant unlock for driving both product adoption and credit consumption.

Competitive positioning crystallized around two primary threats: Clay and Gong. Brandon Tucker\'s partnership work on DMV and other data sources provides answers to Clay, and the team has high confidence in delivering a convincing Clay response by January. However, Gong represents a more significant challenge---they lead in mindshare despite product shortcomings, and customers consistently cite that \"reps like it, but it\'s expensive.\" Victor Oliveros assessed the current gap as Gong having A-minus offerings on conversational intelligence and action layer while ZoomInfo has C-minus, requiring urgent catch-up work on both capabilities.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Platform infrastructure work led by Adam Smith, Ali Sadat, and engineering teams continues to be foundational for both Workspace and Studio delivery. The team must resolve resourcing for the A2A message broker and pulses work by engaging Carlos Nunez and Derek, while also ensuring clear ownership of the conversational intelligence roadmap now that Adam Smith has taken over Bert Lui\'s team. The feed experience from Copilot V1 demos exceptionally well but is missing from Workspace, creating an immediate dependency that requires bridging work---potentially through pre-generated artifacts for each user---before the full pulses vision delivers in January or February.

Enablement and GTM leadership engagement remains critical for successful market adoption. AJ Belen identified that while foundational training exists, Gabe Sweet\'s enablement team lacks a structured plan for talk track development, objection handling, and simulation-based practice. This requires top-down intervention from sales leaders like Breyers and Tuna, potentially including video examples of aggressive customer conversations, to shift the field from defensive to offensive positioning on AI credits.

**Looking Ahead**

The immediate priority for the week of November 10th centers on maintaining field confidence through rapid iteration on user experience improvements and quick wins. Both Victor Oliveros and Sneh Kakileti identified specific, high-impact improvements---filterable views, display optimizations, Studio-to-Workspace activation flows---that can ship quickly to demonstrate product momentum. These small changes compound to create meaningful sentiment shifts with the sales organization.

Credit consumption must become the organizational North Star, requiring several coordinated efforts. AJ Belen will deliver the first weekly credit consumption report showing both aggregate consumption and cohort-based analysis by entitlement start date. Adam Smith will lead R&D all-hands enablement on how credits work and the platform\'s future app store model where anyone can ship agents, plays, or services in a credit-driven marketplace. Dominik Facher emphasized the urgency of this mindset shift---every person in the organization should wake up knowing how many credits were consumed the previous week, with 2026 operating cadence and focus working backwards from exponential credit growth.

The team must address the \"feed gap\" between current Workspace capabilities and customer expectations set by Copilot V1. Victor Oliveros, Adam Smith, and Sneh Kakileti will explore bridging solutions---potentially pre-generated artifacts for each user that surface prioritized actions and insights---while the full pulses vision remains on track for January/February delivery. This work unlocks the platform story of consolidating scattered tools and attention into a single, prioritized workflow. Parallel efforts on conversational intelligence positioning, Gong competitive capabilities, and infrastructure optimization will position the team to accelerate through Q4 and into the critical planning window for 2026.

## **GTM Studio Team Weekly Report - November 3-7, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The November 3rd release went live successfully with Studio and Workspace activation now in production, marking a major milestone as we transition from planning to real-world usage with sellers actively using the product in live prospecting blocks. Workbooks saw strong field adoption with revenue leaders activating custom audiences to their sales teams, though semantic enrichment scalability and data coverage concerns remain open items requiring continued attention through next week. Plays received critical feedback during the week that the DoubleO core user experience needs redesign before customer readiness, prompting a pivot in M2 sequencing to prioritize plays core experience over the original scope, with design workshops scheduled for next week to align on the new direction. ROI Analytics successfully completed GTM Data Store validation in staging with the cutover now targeted for November 13th (delayed by 1-2 days for pre-caching), while Arun finalized the Figma prototype for Milestone 1 instrumentation requirements and began scheduling calls with workspace and agentic chat engineering counterparts to identify gaps. Data Management made strong progress with benchmarks complete for the V2 Data Health Scan ready for circulation to prioritized accounts next week, M3 designs buttoned up with three design partners scheduled for validation, and M5 steel thread narrative complete showing the end-to-end data management flow in GTM Studio with AI onboarding designs kicking off next week.

**Key Momentum Areas**

**November 3rd Release Shipped with Real Seller Adoption:** The team successfully launched GTM Studio and Workspace activation to production on November 3rd, with sellers immediately putting the product into action during dedicated prospecting blocks. Revenue leaders activated custom-built workbooks to their sales teams, and the field is now using Studio not just for demos but as part of actual go-to-market plays. This represents a fundamental shift from building to delivering measurable business impact, with 47 sales solutions demos already booked in November alone within one week of prospecting. Sneh noted the tremendous positive energy from the field and the strong conviction in the problem space we\'re solving.

**Data Management Gaining Commercial Traction:** Corina\'s Data Health Scan prototype generated immediate pipeline results, with early customer engagement already creating meetings and advancing \$400K+ in active opportunities across prioritized accounts. The team onboarded approximately 40 AMs who are now equipped with the narrative and data points to drive upsell conversations, with early wins including meetings secured at Randstad and Palo Alto Networks based on the scan results. The V2 prototype will validate metrics with real customer data next week, and M3 (Data Health Scan in GTM Studio) has three design partners scheduled for feedback on both designs and narrative.

**Plays Pivot Toward Better Product Experience:** Following the November 3rd release and deeper evaluation of the DoubleO integration, Mohan and the plays team received feedback from Sneh and Dominic that the core plays user experience should be the first priority for M2 rather than the original scope. While M1 successfully proved the POC that DoubleO workflows can run in GTM Studio, the key user flows and experience need redesign before being customer-ready. This strategic pivot maintains the high-level goal of bringing plays to external customers in Q1 but re-sequences the execution path to ensure product quality, with design workshops scheduled for next week to align on the new direction.

**Goals & Progress**

**Workbooks**

**Progress - November 3rd Release Deployed with Strong Field Engagement:** Jagannath\'s team successfully shipped the November 3rd release to production with Studio agentic capabilities now live, including semantic enrichment (though scalability concerns remain), deep research enrichment, and the new AI emailer built in-house to replace the original integration. The release is resonating strongly with customers and internal teams, with the use case artifact landing particularly well---every customer immediately understands what Studio does when walking through the three use cases, and the narrative connecting Studio to Workspace activation is compelling. Tanvi supported the launch by capturing feedback in the backlog sheet, helping test new create/enrich modals, documenting find contacts problems and user journeys, and completing discussions with the engineering team on adding APS to workbook enrichment with a tentative timeline expected next week.

**Strategic Challenges - Semantic Data Coverage and Enablement Gaps (Clear path forward):** While semantic enrichment shipped to production, there are open concerns around data coverage and quality that weren\'t fully resolved by the November 3rd deadline. The team is actively working on semantic scaling, but data coverage and quality issues are still being uncovered. Additionally, enablement across the field, support, and SC teams is weak---there\'s a lack of understanding about what semantic is, how it works, and how it\'s differentiated from other capabilities. Jagan is continuing to drive improvements in semantic scalability, and the team recognizes that while these are not blockers to the release, they represent important areas for rapid iteration based on early production usage. The team also identified that multiple customers (Udemy, Security Scorecard) have workbook use cases requiring custom CRM fields but lack the right stakeholders on calls or immediate capacity to configure these fields, creating friction in early access sessions despite strong customer engagement---once configuration is completed (as seen with Lucidlink), customers can progress quickly.

**Plays**

**Progress - M1 Delivered to Staging with Pivot to Core Experience Redesign:** Karthik and the plays team successfully delivered M1 to staging, making plays navigation available in GTM Studio for internal users to test, which represents an exciting milestone for integrating the acquired DoubleO product into GTM Studio within just a couple of months of acquisition. Mohan completed enablement materials for the November 3rd Copilot activation release including PRFAQ, release notes, demo videos, and how-to guides, and all P1/P0 bugs were addressed for the 11/3 readiness. However, following the release and deeper evaluation, the team received feedback that the DoubleO core user experience needs significant redesign before being ready for customers---while M1 proved the POC that workflows can run in GTM Studio, key user flows around selecting input data sources, designing workflows, and running workflows need substantial polish and enhancement.

**Planning Update - M2 Scope Re-Sequencing for Better Product Experience (Clear path forward):** Following PRD review feedback from Sneh and Dominic, the team is extending the M2 milestone to Jan to prioritize improving the core plays experience rather than the original scope. The DoubleO team doesn\'t have sufficient time to polish the user experience before moving to other work, leaving several UX gaps around input data source selection, workflow design, and workflow execution that need addressing. Mohan is scheduling design workshops for next week to document enhancement areas and align on a new direction for what feels satisfactory to deliver in M2. This represents a re-sequencing of work rather than a major strategic pivot---the high-level goal of bringing plays to external customers in Q1 remains unchanged, but the stepping stones to get there are being re-evaluated to ensure product quality. The team also identified that AI credit charging behavior for workflow previews needs further discussion and alignment, as there\'s a requirement to generate previews free of charge for the first 10 records but current architecture charges credits when data leaves the system. We\'ll parallel path M2 and M3 towards a Jan deliverable date. There are three areas of work: Backend - scalability (running thousands of workflows in parallel) and infrastructure work continues as planned; Frontend - we\'ll prioritize batch run experience in Plays first, then work on workbook connectivity; M3 - Triggers and Actions has very little dependence on M2 and runs in parallel.

**ROI Analytics**

**Progress - GTM Data Store Cutover Validation Complete with December GA on Track:** Arun\'s team successfully completed validation of the GTM Data Store in the staging environment with no critical issues identified, positioning the cutover for November 13th (delayed by 1-2 days from the original November 12th target due to pre-caching job requirements). The team started working on LRT ticket requirements to support the December 9th GA release and made significant progress on instrumentation requirements for Milestone 1, which covers ROI reporting across Workbooks, Workspace, Agentic Chat, and AI Credits. Arun finalized a Figma prototype showing the full instrumentation framework and reviewed it with William Lam for workbooks, with CFA now identifying gaps in workbook instrumentation. Scheduling is underway with Adam, Lars, Jesse, and other engineering counterparts to review requirements for agentic chat, credits, and workspace and identify any remaining gaps.

**Strategic Challenges - Instrumentation Prioritization and Enablement Message Clarity (No additional action required):** The primary challenge this week centered on getting instrumentation and pipeline setup prioritized with source teams for both Workspace and Workbooks, though Brahm is actively working with the relevant teams to ensure these efforts move forward. Jagan will be prioritizing the instrumentation requirements, and Lars will review the proposal to confirm feasibility of embedding workbook analytics. Separately, Brahm identified confusion in early enablement around attribution versus correlation in how the ROI product is built---the product is designed to show correlation rather than claim attribution of ROI to ZoomInfo, but many AMs and CSMs new to the product misunderstand this positioning because most past ROI attempts at ZoomInfo were focused on claiming attribution. This represents an unlearning challenge that\'s being addressed through talk tracks with Gabe Sweet\'s enablement team, making sure the messaging is crystal clear to avoid defensive \"claim the numbers\" discussions that aren\'t the intent of the product.

**Data Management**

**Progress - V2 Prototype Ready and M3 Design Partners Scheduled:** Corina\'s team completed benchmarks for the V2 Data Health Scan prototype, incorporating ZoomInfo CRM data to show customers their current fill rates, benchmark those against industry standards, and demonstrate potential uplift from enrichment---these benchmarks will be used in both the PDF V2 version and the GTM Studio M3 design. The V2 prototype is launching next week to approximately 20 prioritized accounts to validate that metrics align with what customers see in their CRM, essentially functioning as an in-depth QA session with real customer data. For M3 (Data Health Scan in GTM Studio), Corina updated all requirements to include exact logic so engineering can pick up the work in a shovel-ready state, and three design partners are scheduled for next week to validate designs and narrative. For M5 (AI Onboarding), the team completed analysis of the most common rules used in Ringlead to use as suggestions in the AI onboarding flow and has a complete steel thread showing the end-to-end user flow from when a new user clicks on data management through data health scan, purchase, AI onboarding, rule configuration, and job execution.

**Strategic Challenges - Front-End and QA Resourcing Still Open:** While engineering alignment is progressing well with Yamesh identifying names along with Noam and Aran from different engineering teams, and Guy Levine helping on the QA side with front-end support being sought from Nebo\'s team, the specific front-end and QA resources still need to be confirmed. Brahm noted these are being actively solved for and it\'s just a matter of identifying the specific people, but until those resources are locked in, there\'s some risk to M3 (Data Health Scan in GTM Studio) timeline execution. The team needs to confirm who exactly will be helping on the front-end and QA sides so they can be brought into development conversations. That said, there is a clear path forward with active work underway to resolve this, and no additional action is required beyond the resourcing discussions already in progress.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Use Case Artifacts Drive Customer Understanding:** Jagan discovered through customer and internal team sessions that the use case artifact---which outlines the three primary use cases for the November 3rd release and maps features to each use case---lands extremely well in every conversation. Customers immediately understand what GTM Studio delivers when presented with this structured narrative, and the approach of switching between the artifact and live product demo while having customers work through examples in real-time creates an effective training experience. This validates that leading with business outcomes and use cases rather than features creates much stronger comprehension and engagement, particularly as the product grows in complexity.

**Studio Chat Full-Page Experience is Actually Plays:** Jagan had a significant realization during the week that the full-page Studio Chat experience the team has been exploring is fundamentally the same problem that plays is solving. Customers go through a series of steps in their go-to-market work---building exploratory audiences, refining them, moving to actual audience creation, performing enrichment---and this step-by-step rinse-and-repeat journey is exactly what plays orchestrates. Rather than having Studio Chat as a separate capability and plays as another separate thing, these should be unified into one product where the agentic interface helps users navigate through their go-to-market plays. This insight has major implications for how the team thinks about the product framework going forward and will be shared visually with the broader team next week.

**Multiple Customers Blocked by CRM Field Configuration Capacity:** Tanvi observed across multiple early access sessions (Udemy, Security Scorecard) that customers have strong workbook use cases requiring custom CRM fields like \"opp score\" but consistently lack the right stakeholders on calls or immediate internal capacity to configure these fields with their CRM teams. This creates a blocker in progressing during early access sessions despite customer engagement and interest in the product. Once configuration is completed (as demonstrated with Lucidlink), customers can move forward fairly quickly. This pattern highlights a customer behavior and capacity constraint rather than a product issue, but it impacts the efficiency of the early access program and requires consideration in how the team structures customer onboarding and enablement going forward.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

**Workspace and Agentic Chat Instrumentation (No additional action required):** Arun needs to schedule and complete calls with Adam, Lars, Jesse, and other engineering counterparts next week to review Milestone 1 requirements for workspace analytics, agentic chat, and AI credits instrumentation to identify any gaps. Jagan will be prioritizing the instrumentation requirements, and Lars will review the proposal to confirm feasibility of embedding workbook analytics. This is actively being worked on with clear next steps, so no additional action is required.

**Semantic Data Coverage and Scaling (No additional action required):** While semantic enrichment shipped to production, Jagan\'s team is continuing to work on scaling improvements and addressing data coverage and quality concerns that remain open items. The team is actively iterating on semantic scaling, so no additional action is required, though this remains an area of focus for continued improvement through next week and beyond.

**Looking Ahead**

**Production Feedback Cycles and Field Support:** This week marks the shift from building to operating in production with real customers using GTM Studio and Workspace as part of their sales motions. The team expects significant product feedback from sellers during their prospecting blocks and from the broader field as they demo and use the product with customers. Fast feedback cycles with quick wins and bug fixes will be essential to maintain momentum and keep confidence high with the sales team who are effectively selling the product they\'re using. Sneh emphasized the importance of not being reactive but proactively anticipating the questions and feedback that will emerge, particularly around ROI reporting and usage visibility.

**Hardening December Release Planning and Plays Core Experience:** With the November 3rd release successfully shipped, the team can now shift focus back to planning and hardening the December path, which was cooled off during the final weeks of November 3rd preparation. For plays specifically, next week\'s design workshops will be critical to align on the new direction for M2 core experience improvements, determining which enhancement areas to tackle, and establishing what scope feels satisfactory for delivery. Mohan, Neha, and the plays team will work through detailed user flows to get M2 scoped at least 80-90% of the way so execution can start quickly the following week.

**ROI and Plays Pressure Points in Demo Narrative:** As the team ramps customer conversations and demos, two specific areas will require focused attention. First, ROI reporting and usage analytics are consistently the immediate follow-up question after showing the Studio to Workspace journey---customers want to know how they\'ll see if their sellers are doing anything with the activated audiences. Arun and Brahm need to get crisp about the now/next/later roadmap and potentially leverage early Figma mocks with the solution consultant team so they have something to show prospects even before features ship, similar to how the team successfully used design mocks for ROI before product availability. Second, plays naturally comes up in seller conversations as they discuss workspace activation---the framing that sales naturally landed on is that pushing audiences to workspace \"is plays\"---but View publishing alone isn\'t the right product for what sellers need, which is tasks and to-dos. The team needs to be very clear about what use cases View publishing solves versus what will come with play automation to set proper expectations while selling what currently exists.

## **Data Executive Team Weekly Report - November 3-6, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Dana\'s team exceeded mobile phone enrichment targets by 45%, successfully attaching 5.5 million ByteMine mobile phones to U.S. contacts against a goal of 5 million---with the full 7.25 million records processed ahead of schedule. This substantial lift in mobile coverage positions the team well for the remaining 99 million ByteMine records awaiting processing. Meanwhile, Dow secured the complete S&P fleet data file and expects delivery to Valvoline by week\'s end despite ongoing legal agreement negotiations, unblocking multiple Q4 opportunities. Engineering teams made solid progress defining Company 3.0 profiler requirements, and Suresh deployed a Contributory Network eligibility agent that consolidates compliance data across multiple Salesforce screens into a single view.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Dana\'s Research and Data Enablement team processed 7.25 million ByteMine mobile phone records this week, successfully attaching 5.5 million to U.S. contacts---a 45% improvement over the 5 million target. The team also completed 1.1 million bad data fixes, a significant increase over typical production, enabled by dedicated team resources. This momentum continues with an additional 2 million 5x5 freemail records queued for infusion this week, steadily expanding contact coverage in high-demand markets.

Dow received the complete S&P fleet data file and has matching results returning by end of week, positioning the team to deliver productized fleet data to Valvoline by next week. The franchise webinar drew over 15 external participants including prospects like Toast and customer BBSI, with a \$100K proposal moving forward. These vertical dataset motions are generating substantial pipeline, with the team ending October at over \$2 million in new opportunities.

Suresh implemented the Contributory Network Eligibility Status Lookup Agent, now available in legal and compliance workspaces. The agent consolidates contract details, DPA indicators, and data sharing settings into a single consolidated view, eliminating the need to navigate multiple Salesforce and Snowflake screens. Early feedback from compliance teams has been positive, and the platform team has tickets in place to sync eligibility data from Snowflake to ZDP for downstream system access.

**Goals & Progress**

**Company 3.0 Pipeline Development:** Ethan completed requirements documentation for the final three MVP profilers (description, industry, and phone), bringing all MVP profiler requirements to completion. The profiler system includes configurable source weights, validation rules, and value-based boosts, providing unprecedented no-code control for understanding, modifying, and testing data quality improvements. Engineering design reviews are underway, with initial testing of matching and indexing components scheduled for next week to evaluate source migration strategies from Company 2.0 to 3.0.

**Fleet Data Productization:** The complete S&P fleet data file arrived this week with matching results expected by end of week, enabling delivery to Valvoline by next week and supporting additional Q4 opportunities with WEX and Lytx. The team plans to enhance match rates through UDB matching, potentially reaching 60-70% for prospect files. The main remaining blocker is executing the legal agreement with S&P, though the team secured data access to maintain momentum on productization work.

**Email Validation and Generation:** Steve\'s team completed testing of Clickagy data as a source for email generation, achieving 87-90% deliverability for catch-alls and unknowns when Clickagy hashed emails were seen on cookies within the past 60 days. This strong performance validates Clickagy as a valuable new source for international email publishing and improved email coverage. The team is designing a collaborative test with NeverBounce to evaluate whether Web Data on Demand results can predict email validity, though initial skepticism about the approach led to scaled-back validation before committing full resources.

**Strategic Challenges**

Brandon raised concerns about GTM Data Store resourcing and the reliance on Peter to complete schema design work for four additional datasets. While Peter\'s dedication to the work is appreciated, the approach doesn\'t scale for ongoing dataset onboarding needs. The team lacks clear documentation or templates that would enable broader participation across the data organization or even allow partners to self-serve schema design. Multiple stakeholders need sign-off on each dataset, creating bottlenecks that will slow future dataset launches unless the process is streamlined and commoditized.

The Waterfall enrichment project needs validation through sample data to ensure the team is making correct decisions about which data to return and which to exclude. Engineering teams are already building based on requirements documents, but without concrete examples to evaluate against expected application behavior, there\'s risk of misalignment between data layer decisions and downstream product needs. Brandon emphasized the need for samples by end of week to validate assumptions with Amesh\'s platform team and Snee\'s applications team.

Publishing logic currently prevents enrichment for contacts who have valid mobile phones and emails but lack current employment information, putting ZoomInfo at a disadvantage when competitors return this data. Dominik\'s recent studio analysis revealed numerous valuable contacts---investors, limited partners, and others between roles---who remain unpublished despite having accurate contact information. The team identified that the reach-out functionality built for the Canada index provides a template for solving this, potentially just requiring applications teams to invoke the same call, though clarity is needed on whether additional scenarios require different handling.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Brandon observed that the Enterprise New Business Sales Team signed more deals in October than any previous quarter at higher average ACV, with many customers targeting SMB and non-tech companies rather than traditional tech buyers. Companies like Suncoast Rentals (truck and forklift rental) need coverage of small businesses across diverse industries where ZoomInfo\'s data is better than competitors but still has significant gaps. This shift in customer profile highlights the strategic importance of accelerating leadership page crawling and employee page scraping to unlock hundreds of millions of contacts at smaller companies.

Ethan\'s preliminary analysis of leadership, board, and employee page crawling opportunities suggests hundreds of millions of potential contacts could be added through systematic website scraping. Combined with faster domain addition from customer contributions, improved crawling capabilities, and incentives for large customers in new industries to contribute their email data, the team sees a convergence of three capabilities that could dramatically improve SMB contact coverage. This approach is particularly powerful because new customer segments likely possess significant email data for small companies that ZoomInfo hasn\'t historically covered well.

Jody\'s key reflection emphasized the need for more ruthless prioritization across the Core Data team, acknowledging that there will never be a shortage of work but the team can achieve more impact by focusing efforts rather than keeping a hundred plates spinning simultaneously. The first step involves documenting all work on each team member\'s plate and explicitly identifying items that are known needs but not current priorities. This shift in approach aims to drive better alignment on outcomes and reduce the tendency to start solutions before clearly defining the problem being solved.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our collaboration with Ali\'s platform engineering team on GTM Data Store onboarding revealed significant process gaps that need resolution before dataset onboarding can scale efficiently. While the platform team is driving toward standardization, unclear handoffs and multiple required sign-offs create friction. Brandon observed that if five different people need to approve each new data source, the process simply won\'t work. The team is exploring whether a comprehensive playbook could enable the broader data organization---or even partners---to define schemas and make data available without extensive engineering coordination.

The applications and platform teams need clarity on reach-out functionality to enable enrichment for unpublished contacts with valid contact information. Ethan noted that the Canada index implementation already provides the necessary infrastructure, potentially requiring just a configuration change to expand availability. Brandon requested that Ethan connect with Casey and John to understand current plans and ensure alignment on whether the existing reach-out approach handles all necessary scenarios or requires modifications for broader unpublished contact access.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s primary focus continues the momentum on ByteMine, planning for the broader 99 million record dataset. Dana\'s team will coordinate with George to scale up throughput for adding all 5x5 and ByteMine emails and mobiles---even for contacts where ZoomInfo already has data---to support the Waterfall enrichment capability with comprehensive secondary values for business email, supplemental email, and mobile attributes.

Fleet data delivery to Valvoline by week\'s end remains the top vertical dataset priority, followed by continued productization work to support WEX and Lytx opportunities. Dow\'s focus includes securing execution of the S&P legal agreement while maintaining momentum on entity resolution and calculated fields based on the matched data. The franchise dataset continues generating pipeline with multiple customer conversations in flight, and the team is refining marketing approaches to run more targeted vertical campaigns to specific accounts and personas.

Ethan begins testing the Company 3.0 pipeline matching and indexing components next week with newly established environments, evaluating both complete company reshuffling and bootstrapping approaches to determine the optimal source migration strategy. The profiler requirements are progressing through engineering design review, positioning the team to integrate these no-code configurable systems into the pipeline as development continues. Brandon will lead the team through GTM Data Store schema design working sessions to accelerate readiness for four additional datasets while developing better documentation to enable future scaling.

## **SalesOS/Copilot Team Weekly Report - November 3-6, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Sean Walter delivered a refocused roadmap addressing the GTM Data Model pivot while Adam Severance pushed significant chat accuracy improvements live behind feature flags for 25% of users. Workbook activation has emerged as the most requested demo flow from sales teams, requiring potential scope adjustments as this becomes the primary sales motion. GTM Data Model integration is absorbing capacity from senior engineers who are also critical for chat improvements, creating resource tension that needs resolution. Zero Config progress advanced with Harinath Krishnamoorthy establishing Intent Clusters as the bridge between GTM Offerings and Copilot configuration, while MCP server development for Intent data began to enable both Workspace integration and external LLM access.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

**Copilot Workspace chat accuracy received its largest quality improvement to date**, with Adam Severance shipping dozens of prompt refinements addressing semantic ambiguities, SFDC navigation issues, and tool call failures. The improvements are going live behind feature flags for a % of users, with expanded testing planned before full GA. This addresses the #1 user complaint about chat not understanding account/opportunity context correctly, directly impacting the core Workspace experience that sales teams are now demoing to customers.

**ZoomInfo Intent data integration into Workspace advanced through MCP server architecture**, with Harinath Krishnamoorthy completing technical discovery that identified two implementation paths: MCP server attachment (higher capability) versus direct field addition (available today). Lars and the Agentic team confirmed MCP as the preferred approach, enabling both natural language queries for Intent data and external LLM access for customers wanting to use Intent signals in Claude or ChatGPT. This positions ZoomInfo ahead of competitors like 6sense by making Intent data accessible across customer workflows.

**Zero Config requirements achieved breakthrough architectural clarity** when Harinath Krishnamoorthy identified Intent Clusters as the natural bridge between GTM Offerings and Copilot configuration. Rowan and the GTM Config team validated this approach, which eliminates manual topic selection during onboarding by automatically recommending topics based on what products/services customers sell. This directly addresses the 2-3 week configuration delay that increases early churn risk and enables day-one value delivery.

**Goals & Progress**

**Copilot Workspace:** Major progress on multiple fronts including chat accuracy overhaul (dozens of improvements live in staging), CRM update UX finalization (API contracts in progress), and email sequencing solution alignment (cross-team review scheduled). Dylan Halladay built five new HTML artifact templates and advanced slides artifact capability with POC for corporate deck recreation. Sean Walter completed the sales-ready 3-month roadmap and initiated GTM Data Model requirements documentation with meetings scheduled with Andres\' team. The 2K limit experience improvements and recommended filters work shipped, though Views functionality remains constrained by API-call architecture pending GTM Data Model migration.

**ZoomInfo Intent:** Harinath Krishnamoorthy completed technical discovery for Intent in Workspace, establishing MCP server as the implementation path with dual benefits: Agentic platform integration and Enterprise API exposure for customer LLMs. Zero Config architecture defined using Intent Clusters to bridge Offerings data, enabling hyper-personalized topic recommendations at first login. Data Science pipeline validation continues after bug fixes, with LLM Judge evaluation framework in development using production data. Intent Recommendation Phase 2 validation work partially complete with final feedback summary delivery pushed to next week.

**Admin Zero Experience:** David Goulden finalized documentation and info packs for Admin Defined Territories GA release, though video recording delayed until developer returns from vacation. MCP development for opening territory definitions to Agentic layer progressing but slower than desired. Priority Accounts work continues with GTM Data Model query testing showing some scalability concerns, requiring alternative approach. UI designs for admin tuning of CRM matching rules completed and ready for circulation. Engineering team remains heavily constrained by customer escalations and Workbooks-related priorities.

**Additional Initiatives:** Gabe Pirela advanced multiple initiatives including CRM update designs (engineering feedback incorporated), email sequencing requirements refinement (cross-team review scheduled), and Workspace desktop app (security review complete, targeting week of 11/17 for internal release). Ant Cuomo distributed pulses product brief and is sourcing feedback, with call scheduled with Sri to align on out-of-the-box pulses from signals pipeline. Concept and UX iterations for pulse continue with Ryan McMaster. Homepage refresh design finalized with engineering kickoff completed, targeting delivery before 11/18. Mobile prototype socialization continues ahead of design resource allocation. Profiles NBA agent iterations ongoing to ensure proper JSON formatting and output rendering.

**Strategic Challenges**

**Resource contention between short-term UX fixes and GTM Data Model migration** is creating difficult prioritization decisions for the Workspace team. Sean Walter flagged that temporary improvements to address current direct/API SFDC integration limitations are absorbing significant capacity from the same senior engineers needed for GTM Data Model work. The 2K limit issues, grouping improvements, and filter enhancements all require medium-to-large development efforts, yet the team faces the prospect of \"throwaway work\" knowing GTM Data Model migration will replace this architecture. Adam Severance emphasized users are currently taking the hit while the team debates how much to invest in improvements that may become obsolete in months.

**Workbook activation flow has emerged as the critical demo motion** but lacks the polish needed for consistent success, according to Sean Walter\'s assessment after observing multiple sales demonstrations. This workflow---where users activate Studio workbooks into Workspace---is increasingly what prospects want to see, yet current implementation has friction points affecting demo quality. Sean noted this may require bumping priority higher and making compromises elsewhere, though he explicitly wouldn\'t compromise on chat improvements or pulses work. Victor Oliveros confirmed this is being demoed heavily by the enterprise sales team but questioned breadth of adoption across the broader field organization.

**Evaluation framework gaps are stifling Chat Accuracy improvements**, as Adam Severance discovered during this week\'s improvement sprint. An evaluation framework exists but isn\'t scaled to comprehensively test all edge cases, and isn\'t accessible to the Workspace Product team. Ryan Stevens and Carlos Nunez\'s teams are making rapid improvements--- with new data science hires now in the mix--- but timeline for product team access is still unknown. This has created a \"death by a thousand cuts\" scenario where small failure points are getting through to Production (e.g. semantic ambiguity handling, tool call failures, drift, SFDC navigation issues), oftentimes only visible with live SFDC data. To help resolve, the team has flagged the new agent and is slowly expanding internal access to facilitate A/B testing between old and new.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Intent Clusters function as a natural \"Rosetta Stone\" between products**, a key architectural insight from Harinath Krishnamoorthy\'s Zero Config work this week. Rather than building separate mapping tables for each offering-to-topic relationship, Intent Clusters already represent \"collections of topics for business interests\"---exactly what GTM Offerings describe. This pattern of finding existing abstractions that capture relationship semantics rather than creating integration-specific data structures could apply to other cross-product scenarios like AFS models mapping to CRM fields. The GTM Config team\'s immediate enthusiasm for this approach validates that manual configuration is a friction point affecting multiple teams, strengthening the business case for Zero Config investment.

**MCP server architecture provides dual strategic value: internal Workspace integration plus external customer LLM access.** Harinath Krishnamoorthy\'s technical discovery revealed that building MCP for Intent solves two problems simultaneously: enabling natural language Intent queries in Workspace while allowing customers to access ZoomInfo Intent data in Claude, ChatGPT, or other LLM environments. This transforms ZoomInfo from a destination application to an embedded intelligence layer, directly addressing the \"AI-native enterprise software\" competitive landscape where customers expect tools to work in their preferred AI workflows. ZoomInfo already published MCP servers for contact and company data; adding Intent creates a powerful arsenal while 6sense and DemandBase remain walled gardens.

**Workbook activation represents a fundamental shift in how customers want to experience Workspace**, per Sean Walter\'s observation after watching multiple demos. Rather than starting fresh in Workspace, prospects want to see how their existing Studio workflows translate and activate. This validates the platform convergence strategy but also exposes that the current implementation isn\'t demo-ready for this primary use case. Victor Oliveros\' question about breadth of adoption (is it just the enterprise sales team or the entire field?) is critical---if this becomes the standard demo motion, resource allocation must adjust accordingly even if it means compromising other initiatives.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the GTM Data Model team on Workspace integration continues to be critical for eliminating current SFDC limitations. Sean Walter documented comprehensive requirements covering data needs (objects, SLAs, filtering, sorting), integrations (write-backs, reads), and initiated conversations with Andres, Mark, and others for a December POC. However, this work is pulling the same senior engineers who are critical path for chat accuracy improvements, creating resource tension that Victor Oliveros and engineering leadership need to resolve. The team cannot sacrifice chat quality for data model work, yet both are essential for Workspace success.

David Goulden\'s Priority Accounts work with the Platform and Enterprise Search teams revealed fragmentation in how Target Accounts and Priority Accounts APIs are currently structured. Cross-team discussions continue on how to access GTM Data Model CRM data in Search, with potential need for API wrapper simplification. The broader vision involves AI-assisted setup to reduce admin manual work while maintaining configurability, requiring alignment between David\'s work, the Platform team, and Enterprise Search. Territories as a cross-platform object for Search/Intent/WebSights also needs decision framework, as customers continue requesting this expansion.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week\'s focus centers on finalizing the 11/18 release while advancing foundational work for December\'s GTM Data Model integration POC. Sean Walter will complete the internal roadmap artifact for downstream teams and finalize GTM Data Model requirements through Friday\'s meeting with Andres\' team---critical since this affects all Workspace areas from views to profiles to chat.

Key priorities include: Dylan Halladay finalizing slides artifact release plan and gathering internal user feedback on current feature-flagged version; Gabe Pirela completing CRM update designs handoff to engineering and driving email sequencing solution alignment through cross-team review; Ant Cuomo advancing pulses definition through call with Sri on out-of-the-box signals coverage and collecting survey feedback on alert types/frequency/configurability; Adam Severance expanding chat accuracy improvements to 25% of users while continuing work on views improvements and GTM expansion conversations. Harinath Krishnamoorthy will finalize Intent MCP server requirements, complete Data Science pipeline validation after bug fixes, and advance Zero Config implementation plan with offerings-based recommendations.

The team faces a critical balancing act between delivering visible 11/18 improvements (artifacts, views polish, homepage refresh) that counter customer objections as sales begins demoing to prospects, while not losing momentum on foundational work (GTM Data Model integration, MCP architecture, Zero Config) that enables the world-class experience Victor Oliveros emphasized the product must achieve. Resource constraints remain the primary limiting factor, particularly around senior engineers pulled between immediate UX fixes and architectural migrations.

## **Intelligence Team Weekly Report - November 3-7, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The team successfully launched M1 for GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace this week, with both products now live in production. While the rollout went smoothly with no major incidents, immediate focus has shifted to addressing cost optimization and agent accuracy issues that emerged during early customer interactions. Ryan Stevens and Lars Vedo are leading efforts to reduce LLM costs through prompt caching and architectural improvements, while simultaneously working to decrease hallucination rates that currently affect approximately one-third of chat interactions. The team demonstrated strong cross-functional collaboration with design teams to unify chat experiences across products, and initial customer demos are generating significant positive feedback despite some rough edges in the demo path.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

The M1 milestone was successfully deployed to production on Friday, marking a significant achievement for both GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace. Derek Osgood completed the tools infrastructure with CRM, email, and ZoomInfo tools all functional in staging, while the underlying workflow automation is now operational. The launch included the successful implementation of AI credits flowing through the system, providing the team with baseline metrics on actual customer usage patterns and credit consumption.

Cross-team design collaboration reached a new level of maturity this week. Lars Vedo worked with design leadership to map all chat entry points across Sales OS and GTM Studio, proposing unified patterns that are now moving into engineering implementation. The embedded chat experience is visible in workspace staging environments, demonstrating tangible progress toward a consistent user experience across the platform.

External validation came through a standout customer demo with True Context, where Victor showcased the workspace artifact creation capabilities. The demo leveraged semantic data to pull exact quotes from customer calls, directly addressing client pain points and generating visible enthusiasm from prospects. This successful demo pattern is now being studied to identify UI improvements and streamline the demo flow for broader sales team adoption.

**Goals & Progress**

**Platform Launch & Stabilization:** The team successfully toggled feature flags and deployed the M1 release with both GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace now live in production. Derek Osgood\'s tools wave completed with search, scrape, research, docs, spreadsheets, ZoomInfo data, CRM, email, Slack, LinkedIn, and Outreach tools all QA\'d and production-ready. Ryan Stevens moved web search and email agents into batch UDP mode, enabling workbooks to call an infinite number of cells for enrichment through a queue-based approach. The new agent architecture supporting more accurate view creation with ZoomInfo and Salesforce columns is in final testing, with deployment targeted for today to address one of the platform\'s biggest accuracy gaps.

**Cost & Performance Optimization:** Lars Vedo and the engineering team are actively working to address the cost concerns that have become a primary sales barrier. Josh implemented prompt caching improvements currently in testing, with a PR ready for deployment. The team is exploring advanced patterns including orchestrator architecture refinements to reduce context passing between agents, which directly impacts both latency and cost. Ryan Stevens emphasized the focus on cost reduction will yield latency improvements as a byproduct, with initial efforts targeting the removal of unnecessary thinking tokens in React loops and reducing average iteration counts from 3-4 down by at least one iteration. This work is critical as internal feedback and sales team concerns indicate that credit costs are currently the biggest obstacle to customer adoption.

**Context Service & MCP Integration:** Rowan Bailey completed the Q4 roadmap rework for GTM Context, consolidating several months of conversations into a unified direction. The updated microsite and proposed manifest for external MCP integration are now ready, with documentation covering implementation paths from internal to external tools. A significant technical milestone was achieved when ChatGPT was successfully connected as a third-party orchestrator over the MCP, though side-by-side comparisons with Claude revealed completely different interpretations of the same prompts. The team is now working to normalize the experience across orchestrators through improved tool descriptions and will initiate the process to get listed in OpenAI\'s directory next week. Lars Vedo\'s team also implemented a citation pattern that MCP tools can now adopt, with Josh documenting the approach for broader team adoption.

**Strategic Challenges**

Hallucination rates in Copilot chat are concerning, with Robyn Sablosky\'s testing revealing approximately one in three interactions producing hallucinated responses. This accuracy issue requires immediate attention as it directly impacts user trust and product reliability. The root causes are being investigated through prompt analysis and access to LangSmith spaces, with Carlos Nunez coordinating an effort to establish a replicable evaluation framework. The team has smartly narrowed the initial scope to focus on reducing hallucinations as a measurable goal, rather than the broader and harder-to-measure objective of \"making the agent more intelligent.\" Christian and the ML team are being brought in to establish KPIs around agent performance, with clear metrics planned for tracking improvement over time.

The sales team\'s nervousness about value selling AI credits is creating friction in go-to-market efforts. Rather than positioning the platform based on value delivered, the sales organization is approaching conversations as cost reduction exercises, asking how to discount credits and emphasize low pricing instead of demonstrating transformative capabilities. This mindset represents a significant barrier to successful enterprise sales, as the team has built genuinely impressive technology that generates visible excitement in demos. Adam Smith noted that while cost optimization is important, the real issue is helping sales teams shift from defensive pricing discussions to confident value demonstrations. The upcoming focus on cost reduction should help address sales confidence, but cannot come at the expense of product quality or the compelling user experience that currently generates strong customer reactions.

The Pulses initiative reveals organizational alignment gaps, with multiple teams developing parallel solutions without a unified architecture. Derek Osgood is working on event-based triggers through the Blaze system, Robyn Sablosky received requirements for a recommendation engine to surface daily insights, and various product teams are conceptualizing Pulses differently across Copilot Workspace, GTM Studio, and other surfaces. Adam Smith identified that the A2A message broker architecture documented six months ago for the Workflows product redesign needs to be pulled forward and unified across these efforts. Without consolidation, the team risks building four different versions of Pulses that don\'t integrate well, creating fragmented experiences and technical debt. This requires immediate leadership attention to align all stakeholders on a single pulse system architecture that serves as the foundation for all implementations.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The launch week provided critical real-world validation of the platform under actual customer load. The AI credits system exercised successfully, revealing baseline usage patterns that inform future optimization efforts. More importantly, the team gained concrete understanding of where the product excels and where it struggles. The demo path with True Context demonstrated the platform\'s ability to deliver genuine wow moments when properly orchestrated, with artifact creation and semantic data integration creating tangible value that prospects immediately recognize. However, Victor had to work around several UI friction points to achieve this result, highlighting specific areas requiring polish rather than wholesale changes.

Third-party orchestrator integration revealed important insights about architectural flexibility. When ChatGPT was connected as an external MCP orchestrator alongside Claude, the two systems interpreted identical prompts completely differently and presented results in distinct formats. This discovery validates the team\'s early architectural decision to provide abstraction layers rather than tightly coupling to specific LLM behaviors. The challenge now is finding middle-ground clarity in tool descriptions that work well across multiple orchestrators without over-optimizing for any single one. This learning also reinforces that MCP tools should align to conceptual jobs the AI performs rather than REST API-style object structures, requiring a shift in how the team thinks about tool design.

Carlos Nunez\'s work on evaluation frameworks highlighted the importance of scoping problems precisely. Ryan Stevens\' proposal to focus specifically on reducing hallucinations rather than broadly \"improving intelligence\" provides a measurable, actionable target. This approach of reducing complex AI improvement challenges to specific, quantifiable metrics represents a methodology the team should apply to other optimization efforts. The pattern of starting with narrowly defined goals, establishing clear measurement, and iterating based on data will be crucial as the platform scales and handles increasingly diverse customer use cases.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Collaboration with Carlos Nunez\'s platform teams has been essential for progress this week. The front-end engineering resources Carlos helped provision are now picking up Human in the Loop work and embedded chat kit implementation. Brett\'s contribution as a PM supporting the semantic data and agentic platform work proved invaluable, with Ryan Stevens emphasizing that the launch wouldn\'t have been possible without this support. The design team collaboration on unifying chat experiences across products demonstrated effective cross-functional work, with clear alignment on entry points, embedding patterns, and shared UI components now moving into implementation.

The GTM Data Store team relationship requires ongoing attention, particularly around the company data model for config data and the new offerings concept being introduced. Carlos Nunez noted some holdups in reaching agreement on schemas, which is blocking the GTM Config UX work even though Tomer has end-to-end screens ready. A demo is planned for November 15th, but will write to a local database until the data model alignment is resolved. This dependency could delay downstream consumers of account briefs and offerings from testing the new objects in their applications, suggesting the need for a focused alignment session with Linda, Majed, and the GTM Store leadership.

**Looking Ahead**

The immediate priority for next week is getting the new agent with improved view creation capabilities deployed to production, which addresses one of the platform\'s most significant accuracy gaps. Simultaneously, the cost optimization work must continue with urgency, as sales team confidence depends on demonstrating manageable credit consumption patterns. Lars Vedo and Ryan Stevens will balance these two critical paths while ensuring no regressions in the production environment that could undermine early customer trust.

Derek Osgood will shift focus to AI credits implementation in the Double-Zero workspace, with Ryan Stevens offering to pair program on a simple pattern that should integrate cleanly. Rowan Bailey will turn attention to GTM Config loose threads, working with Aadhi to finalize design patterns for one-to-many mappings and other configuration challenges. The team will also initiate the OpenAI directory listing process for the MCP integration, leveraging Dominic\'s existing partnership conversations to smooth the path if needed.

Srivatsa Marthi will finalize November stories for the triggers system, getting both front-end and back-end teams fully implementing toward the early December launch. The discussion with Carlos Nunez and Derek Osgood around aggregation at the play level versus GTM Store level needs resolution to avoid duplicated effort. Carlos will continue advancing the semantic data service backend roadmap for GCP migration while working with the team to establish replicable tests ensuring consistency as models change. The new office hours ritual Lars Vedo is establishing for platform builders should help accelerate adoption across the broader engineering organization as more teams begin leveraging the agentic capabilities.

## **MCP Tiger Team Weekly Report - November 7, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The gateway infrastructure reached a major milestone this week with Carter & Topher completing some of the control plane API endpoints (create, get, and update) and advancing request routing functionality. The team now estimates the control plane at 40-45% complete, with ChatGPT integration demonstrating functional capability despite requiring more prescriptive prompting than Claude. Architecture definition remains fluid as implementation proceeds, creating coordination friction that Vinod and Topher flagged for process improvement.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Carter & Topher delivered the core control plane API endpoints---create, get, and update---establishing the foundation for gateway configuration management. This unblocks subsequent integration work and positions the team to begin end-to-end testing once the gateway layer is operational.

Zheng achieved ChatGPT integration functionality, revealing important behavioral differences between LLM providers that will inform future prompt engineering strategy. The team plans to demonstrate this capability in the 11:30 leadership meeting, providing visibility into integration progress despite the model\'s limitations compared to Claude.

Request routing implementation advanced substantially, though final completion awaits control plane stabilization. This parallel progress across infrastructure layers demonstrates effective task decomposition.

**Goals & Progress**

**Control Plane Development**: Carter & Topher completed create, get, and update API endpoints while actively refining the update functionality. The control plane infrastructure now supports basic configuration operations, establishing the scaffolding for more sophisticated gateway orchestration. Vinod estimates the control plane at 40-45% completion based on delivered functionality relative to end-state requirements.

**Request Routing**: Implementation is substantially complete pending control plane dependency resolution. Topher delivered a working version that operates independently but requires control plane integration for full functionality. This positions the team to rapidly complete routing once upstream dependencies stabilize.

**LLM Integration**: ChatGPT integration is operational but revealed prescriptive prompting requirements compared to Claude\'s more autonomous behavior. Vinod is documenting these differences to inform tool design decisions and determine whether provider-specific optimization is warranted or if consolidated prompt strategies remain viable.

**Strategic Challenges**

Architecture definition is occurring in parallel with implementation, creating coordination overhead as new requirements surface during development. Topher identified that the mcp server URL storage requirement and entitlement/tagging approach were not communicated until implementation was underway. While the team is managing these discoveries, the pattern suggests documentation gaps that slow velocity and create rework risk.

Information flow between Frank and the engineering team relies on private conversations with individual contributors rather than centralized documentation. Topher noted that design decisions discussed with Zheng and Carter were not captured in JIRA or architecture documents, forcing him to rediscover requirements when assuming work. This creates unnecessary friction as team members transition on and off workstreams.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

LLM provider behavior varies significantly in ways that impact tool design philosophy. ChatGPT requires substantially more prescriptive prompting than Claude to achieve comparable results, raising questions about whether tools should be optimized per provider or designed for a lowest-common-denominator approach. This discovery emerged from direct implementation experience and will inform the manifest design strategy.

The gateway migration presents an optimal point to execute tool reconfiguration and rebundling rather than implementing in stages. Rowan and Vinod aligned on consolidating these changes to avoid double-migration costs. This sequencing insight emerged from discussing implementation logistics and prevents wasted engineering effort.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Coordination with Frank on gateway architecture requires better documentation practices to support team scalability. The current reliance on synchronous conversations creates knowledge silos that impede work continuity when team members transition. Vinod plans to address this in a separate discussion to establish more sustainable information-sharing protocols.

**Looking Ahead**

The team targets end-of-November to early December for completing core gateway infrastructure components, at which point focus shifts to end-to-end integration testing. The immediate priority is stabilizing the control plane and completing request routing integration to enable initial tool migration experiments.

Post-infrastructure completion, the team will design and implement a pilot V1 API tool through the gateway to validate the full integration pattern before scaling to additional tools. This will precede the broader tool reconfiguration and rebundling exercise, which Rowan and Vinod agreed should coincide with gateway migration to minimize disruption.

Vinod expects to provide refined timeline estimates within 1-2 weeks as remaining architectural decisions crystallize and implementation velocity becomes more predictable. The team maintains confidence in delivery despite capacity constraints this week, with Carter and Zheng\'s return next week restoring full bandwidth for sprint completion.

## **Semantic Data Team Weekly Report - November 7, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Venkata completed a comprehensive architecture assessment and proposed a scalable redesign that will cut embedding generation costs by 50% through Anthropic batch API calls and eliminate multi-cloud complexity by consolidating the entire pipeline into GCP. The team is now executing a parallel migration strategy---maintaining current operations while building a more efficient system that reduces data hops and enables GPU-accelerated embedding generation through Vertex AI. This 6-8 sprint initiative positions the semantic data infrastructure for enterprise-scale deployment while Jon and Inga maintain tenant quality during the transition.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Venkata delivered a detailed migration plan that addresses critical scalability bottlenecks in the current semantic data pipeline. The proposal eliminates unnecessary data transfers between clouds and Postgres intermediaries, moving to a pure GCP architecture using BigQuery for batch embeddings and exploring Milvus for real-time vector storage. This consolidation enables 50% cost reduction through batch API processing while maintaining quality through continued use of Anthropic models.

Jon focused on operational continuity, conducting knowledge handoffs from Danny to ensure smooth tenant onboarding and pipeline optimization. His work maintaining current system stability creates the runway needed for Venkata\'s architectural migration, preventing any service degradation while the team executes the parallel build strategy.

Sai made progress provisioning a Milvus cluster for vector database evaluation, preparing to test whether it outperforms BigQuery for embedding storage on latency and quality metrics. This evaluation runs parallel to the main migration path, offering potential operational improvements that can be adopted through straightforward data migration.

**Goals & Progress**

**Infrastructure Consolidation**: Venkata mapped the complete migration path from the current multi-cloud architecture to a GCP-native system. The plan preserves the existing system intact while building new pipelines that eliminate Postgres intermediaries and AWS data hops. The team will run both systems in parallel until confident in the new infrastructure\'s stability, then gradually migrate agents to the new BigQuery tables. This approach minimizes risk while delivering substantial efficiency gains.

**Operational Stability**: Jon maintained pipeline quality and tenant onboarding processes during significant team transition. His knowledge transfer work with Danny ensures continuity as the team composition shifts, while his focus on tenant quality metrics keeps the current system healthy. This operational discipline creates the stable foundation required for executing architectural changes without customer impact.

**Vector Database Evaluation**: Sai advanced Milvus cluster provisioning and is now pushing evaluation data to test against production requirements. This parallel workstream provides optionality---if Milvus demonstrates clear advantages over BigQuery for vector storage on latency and retrieval quality, the team can migrate with minimal friction since the data formats remain compatible.

**Strategic Challenges**

The team identified a potential data quality issue where Claude 4.5 may be extracting more entities than currently appear in the knowledge graph. Jon observed that API responses indicate 40 entities and 80 relationships being found, but validation logic prevents storage when the graph structure isn\'t valid. This creates a blind spot where apparent volume reduction might actually reflect overly aggressive validation rather than extraction problems. The team needs to analyze Datadog logs to understand which entity types trigger validation failures and adjust either prompting or validation logic accordingly.

The 2048-dimension limit in BigQuery\'s vector implementation raises concerns about retrieval quality. While this constraint could impact the semantic matching capabilities that drive agent performance, the team has contingency options including Rayscale for GPU-accelerated embeddings or custom model hosting through Vertex AI. The dimensional limitation isn\'t a blocker since the architecture supports alternative embedding approaches if evaluation reveals quality degradation.

The 6-8 sprint timeline for complete migration requires careful resource allocation and sequencing. Venkata needs engineering capacity to execute multiple parallel workstreams---batch processing migration, near-real-time pipeline redesign, and BigQuery table schema implementation. The team is allocating resources aggressively but must balance migration work against operational maintenance to avoid service disruption.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The architecture review revealed excessive data movement creating both cost and latency penalties. Data currently flows from BigQuery to Postgres to BigQuery in different projects, with multiple cloud transfers in between. Venkata\'s analysis showed these hops exist due to historical evaluation of AlloyDB that never concluded decisively. Eliminating these intermediaries by processing embeddings directly in BigQuery where source data already lives dramatically simplifies the system while improving performance.

The team discovered that validation logic may be masking rather than revealing quality issues with Claude 4.5. Rather than accepting apparent entity volume reduction at face value, Jon\'s investigation into API response counts versus stored entities suggests the model is extracting appropriately but downstream validation rejects valid graphs due to overly strict matching rules. This insight shifts the diagnosis from model capability questions to data quality validation tuning.

Consolidating to GCP unlocks capabilities beyond cost reduction. Running the full pipeline in a single cloud environment enables straightforward use of Vertex AI for hosting alternative embedding models if needed, provides access to managed GPU infrastructure through Rayscale for acceleration, and creates a standardized embedding cookbook that other Applied AI teams can adopt. This strategic positioning extends beyond immediate technical benefits to organizational capability building.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Carlos emphasized coordination with Applied AI org on embedding standards and infrastructure patterns. The Milvus evaluation and potential Rayscale integration represent opportunities to establish common tooling across multiple teams working on semantic and vector search problems. Venkata\'s migration plan deliberately preserves flexibility to adopt shared infrastructure decisions rather than locking the semantic data team into isolated technical choices.

**Looking Ahead**

The team enters an 8-12 week migration period focused on building the new GCP-native pipeline while maintaining operational quality in the existing system. Success requires parallel execution across multiple fronts---Venkata architecting the new data flows, Jon maintaining tenant quality and addressing the entity validation issue, and Sai completing vector database evaluation to inform storage layer decisions.

Next week, Jon and Inga will investigate the entity extraction validation mismatch by analyzing Datadog logs to identify which entity types and relationships trigger failures. This analysis should reveal whether prompting adjustments or validation logic changes can unlock the full extraction capability that API responses suggest exists. Sai will complete Milvus evaluation metrics and coordinate with Venkata on batch processing architecture decisions---specifically whether embeddings should flow directly to Milvus or through intermediate BigQuery storage.

The team\'s ability to execute this transition smoothly while maintaining service quality will establish the scalable foundation needed for enterprise semantic data deployment. Venkata\'s phased migration approach minimizes risk by keeping current systems operational until new infrastructure proves stable, giving the team confidence to move deliberately rather than rushing changes that could impact customer experience.

## **Core Data Team Weekly Report - November 3-7, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The Core Data team worked to advance shared services platform alignment while navigating significant challenges in customer education and release communication. Magnus Herweyer pursued completion of a shared services AI data management proposal document, though the actual authoring by technical leads Casey and Michael remained pending due to Studio GA release delays. John Durst exposed systematic gaps in release note adoption, documenting instances where stakeholders asked for release notes in the same Slack thread where they were just shared. Heather Ma finalized the production plan for the Deal Insights Agent with identified dependencies and open questions, while Jody Roberts demonstrated rapid AI prototyping capabilities with an SEC data extraction agent. The team faces mounting pressure to prioritize as Peter Overman reported having \"about a third\" of his actual task list represented in weekly goals.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Magnus Herweyer worked toward getting Michael and Casey to author a platform document for shared services technical architecture, aiming to establish how shared services, Ringlead, and AI data management will work together. While Magnus prepared groundwork and drafted initial content from Slack conversations and confluence docs, the technical leads\' completion was delayed by Studio GA release priorities. Magnus also discovered monetization opportunities through Neustar API pricing analysis, finding phone validation costs at approximately one penny per call, with potential for margin at four cents through NeverBounce.com credits. Additionally, he received roadmap input from Brahm, Ash, and Corina requiring incorporation into shared services planning.

Heather Ma finalized the production plan for the Deal Insights Agent after conducting review sessions with Brandon Tucker (product strategy), Brandon Wilson (data engineering), and Lars Vedo (AI Platform team). The plan shifts from a 10-customer pilot to an immediate GA launch to all \~1,000 eligible CN customers, following AI industry best practices for continuous improvement. Of \~7,000 customers on EULA_05_2025, only \~1,000 are actively contributing data, generating benchmarks for \~360 target companies currently. The plan establishes a 6-milestone roadmap with Brandon Wilson leading agent development while data pipeline work requires dedicated engineering support. Critical dependencies identified: Ron Catineau/Jessie Lindstrom\'s team must move the CN eligibility flag from Snowflake to ZDP (Milestone 1 blocker), and engineering resource assignment needed for data aggregation pipeline (Milestones 2-3).

Jody Roberts successfully socialized a one-pager product strategy & goals template with the team for new initiatives moving forward. Additionally, Jody built an automated agent for SEC data extraction that \"scrapes EDGAR for DEF 14A forms, matches contacts to ZoomInfo profiles, and writes results to Google Sheets,\" demonstrating the capability with a few companies as an example.

John Durst made progress on multiple initiatives including deliverability work for waterfall, VP roadmap development, and establishing evaluation criteria for expanded contact network. He scheduled Thursday working sessions with DaaS teams for feedback on geographic and industry expansion frameworks. His technographics research revealed that GTM motion, new business VP, and data science teams all had \"weak pitch\" rather than strong must-have requirements for the capability, leading him to recommend remediation over major investment.

**Goals & Progress**

**Deal Insights Agent Production Planning**: Heather Ma finalized a 100-day production plan with 6 milestones, shifting from pilot approach to immediate GA launch following AI industry best practices. Brandon Wilson will build initial tables in his BigQuery dev space (yazi-dev-ready-playerone.bwilson) and manage daily update jobs until production infrastructure is established. Critical blockers identified: (1) Ron Catineau/Jessie Lindstrom\'s team must complete CN eligibility flag migration from Snowflake to ZDP, (2) engineering resources needed for Milestones 2-3 data pipeline work. With \~1,000 contributors generating benchmarks for only \~360 companies, launch strategy embraces limited initial coverage that improves as network grows.

**Platform Documentation Status**: The document outlines how AI Data Management and Shared Services work together is nearly completed and will be presented to Imesh, Hasmik, Hanan, and Casey next week to align Shared Services \<\> AIDM. The document aims to clarify \"how teams use shared services\" and establish technical standards, but remains incomplete pending technical lead availability after Studio GA release.

**SEC Leadership Data Extraction**: Jody Roberts \"went down a rabbit hole on building an agent for extracting SEC data\" that can \"put in a company and it\'ll go scrape EDGAR for DEF 14A form, find all of the contacts, try to match them and then write them to a Google sheet.\" The Nvidia example \"looks pretty good\" according to the team feedback.

**Release Communication Breakdown**: John Durst documented that \"entire departments that should know\" about release processes remain unaware. He shared a specific example: \"I posted the release notes and say these are the release notes\...10 lines later they asked us oh, do we have release notes, like in the same conversation.\" He\'s working to establish a codified place for data change inquiries rather than having engineering answer routine questions.

**Strategic Challenges**

Data pipeline ownership for the Deal Insights Agent remains unclear, with Heather expressing uncertainty about whether \"that\'s Roi\'s team\" and who would handle daily query execution and table updates. This ownership gap could delay production deployment despite having engineering resources and schema identified.

The release communication issues extend beyond education. John Durst explained: \"We are personally telling \[people\] that the release notes are \[there\] and not looking at them in the same slack conversation.\" He emphasized this requires \"ownership on the consumers\" rather than more education efforts from product teams, noting that even people present in meetings about the process later claim ignorance.

Resource allocation remains strained across the team. Peter Overman stated each of his items \"probably should get 2 to 6 hours of my time this week. And I\'m gonna be able to give them about 15 minutes based on all the meetings that I have.\" He concluded: \"I feel like I need to cut about 80% of my projects.\" Magnus warned that adding one-pager requirements to already overloaded teams could result in \"less innovation and less scrappiness\" as people lack capacity for additional documentation.

GTM Store deadlines shifted after leadership revealed alternative approaches. John Durst reported that in discussions with Hasmik and VP organization, \"they\'re like, well, we could use our shim\" - referring to copying search service outputs into production, though \"nobody\'s committed\" to this approach, leaving teams uncertain about December 31st requirements.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Heather Ma learned the importance of focused weekly goals, stating: \"Try to be focused on one thing every week. Otherwise, but then of the week I do feel like I didn\'t achieve anything, but I\'m so so busy.\" This echoes the broader team sentiment about the need for ruthless prioritization.

Peter Overman\'s usage analysis challenged fundamental assumptions: \"we\'re not as concentrated in terms of usage, as I had previously imagined. We talk a lot about Fortune 1,000\...There is a lot of usage in the long tail.\" This insight suggests data quality and maintenance priorities should expand beyond flagship enterprise accounts.

The Neustar API pricing discovery revealed specific economics: \"to process about 5 million calls would be about 62 grand a month\" with Magnus calculating that \"if we wanted a 70% profit margin on that service, we charge about 4 cents per phone,\" validating the business model for shared services monetization.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The Deal Insights Agent requires clarity on data pipeline ownership between potential teams including Roy\'s organization. Heather needs resolution on \"who would own the part to run the query every day\" to move forward with production deployment, despite having Python engineering resources and schema ready.

Waterfall MVP December 1st deployment needs tactical alignment across teams. John Durst suggested \"there\'s maybe a misalignment between what engineering can do and what this group of people can do\...I think they have more capacity than we do even if they won\'t say it,\" indicating potential for rebalancing work distribution.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week Heather aims to present the Deal Insights Agent production plan to DAI team to secure engineering resources for data pipeline work, with Brandon Wilson ready to begin agent development independently while infrastructure decisions are being made.

Jody Roberts emphasized continued prioritization needs: He offered direct support to help teams \"identify their true top 3-5 priorities and explicitly drop items 6-50.\"

Critical decisions include finalizing the shared services document once Casey becomes available post-Studio GA, establishing consumer accountability mechanisms for release note adoption rather than more education attempts, and determining appropriate scope for one-pager documentation to avoid further burdening teams while maintaining alignment benefits.

## **Team Provisioning & Login Weekly Report - November 3, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

The high-leverage goal of cutting over to AI action credits in production was a success, with both internal teams and Early Access (EA) customers now generating actual usage data on the AI platform. The immediate challenge is a security and billing risk identified with the \"login as\" feature, where internal users inadvertently charge customer credit lots after impersonating a customer. Jessie Kain Lindstrom is prioritizing a plan next week to deprecate the current \"login as\" functionality and implement the new admin impersonation feature. Concurrently, Brannen Huske is strategically leveraging the impending 2026 cost increase for Legacy SSO infrastructure to create a pricing \"wedge,\" incentivizing customers to migrate to the newer, more secure infrastructure.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Jessie Kain Lindstrom successfully deployed the AI action credits in production, which is crucial for tracking utilization and is already capturing real usage from internal teams and EA customers. This milestone is the first step toward validating the platform\'s value and supporting the upcoming billing structure.

Brannen Huske advanced the SCIM implementation by meeting with Zscaler, establishing a satisfactory path forward for moving to a reporting structure user group and defining basic reporting standards. This progress on identity and access management is essential for improving the GTM Studio and GTM Workspace login experiences.

A strategic breakthrough was the formulation of a pricing strategy to drive the migration off Legacy SSO. Brannen Huske initiated conversations with the packaging and pricing group to utilize the extra infrastructure costs starting in 2026 as a tool to incentivize customers to move to a newer, more secure and feature-rich login experience.

**Goals & Progress**

**AI Credit Provisioning**: Jessie Kain Lindstrom successfully cut over to AI action credits in production, achieving the high-leverage goal for the week. The platform is now capturing actual usage data, though no customers have paid for the credits yet. A short-term solve is being implemented to address the \"login as\" issue by adding the existing banner to Workspace.

**Login Experience Modernization**: Brannen Huske refocused on improving GTM Studio and GTM Workspace login items. The team made progress on SCIM implementation by aligning with Zscaler, which involved moving to groups for management and defining a basic API for license reporting. Brannen also began work to create options to push people off Legacy SSO to enable improved features like passkeys and biometrics.

**AI Credit Promo Definition**: A blocker related to the unlimited AI credit promotion was addressed by defining how the credit lots and SKUs can work for tracking. Brannen Huske\'s next step is to collaborate with the Agentic team, RevOps, and other stakeholders to create a simple-to-implement promo structure, consciously avoiding over-engineering for a short-term offering.

**Strategic Challenges**

A critical security and billing gap was identified with the \"login as\" feature immediately following the AI credits go-live. The issue arose when internal users, logged in as customers, inadvertently attempted to charge customer credit lots when engaging with chat in Workspace. While there was no customer impact this week as no AI credits had been purchased, this poses a major risk of accidentally billing customers in the near future.

Pushback on moving customers off Legacy SSO remains a persistent challenge, as customers lack a strong friction point to motivate a move to the newer infrastructure. Legacy SSO also has a bug where it fails to expire certificates, creating a security and management overhead that requires \"weird solutions\" to support. Brannen Huske is addressing this by using the upcoming 2026 infrastructure cost as leverage for a pricing incentive.

The team has not yet found the root cause or pattern for users being signed out in certain situations. The development team is continuing to investigate and is actively trying to gather survey results and talk to customers to identify underlying patterns for this disruptive login bug.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

The successful cutover to AI credit charging immediately highlighted the unforeseen liability of the existing \"login as\" feature. This demonstrated that seemingly minor utility features can become major billing risks once a paid consumption model is introduced, mandating a fast follow to deprecate the functionality.

The discovery that Adobe is a high-quality partner for Zscaler in returning useful usage information via SCIM provides an industry standard to aim for. Brannen Huske and the team will now analyze competitor offerings to ensure the SCIM implementation hits industry best practices, moving beyond the current, basic offering.

The impending cost increase for Legacy SSO infrastructure in 2026 is a valuable strategic lever for driving customer behavior. The insight is that without a financial or operational friction point, customers will not voluntarily transition to a better login experience, such as one supporting passkeys and biometrics. Pricing the legacy option and offering the modern solution for free is the proposed incentive.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Our work with the Packaging and Pricing group is critical for creating the necessary pricing strategy to drive the migration off Legacy SSO. Continued collaboration is needed to finalize the pricing structure that will effectively incentivize customers to move from the paid Legacy SSO to the free, modern SSO starting in 2026.

The Agentic Team and Semantic Data API team are essential for advancing the Converstaion Intelligence tool and other roadmap items. Specifically, the Agentic team is needed for resource allocation to support Contact ID for the Converstaion Intelligence tool. Additionally, the Agentic team and RevOps will be key partners for Brannen Huske to define a simple, implementable structure for the unlimited AI credit promotion.

**Looking Ahead**

The primary focus for next week is to rapidly address the \"login as\" security risk while continuing to modernize the login experience and advance the AI credit promotion structure.

Jessie Kain Lindstrom\'s immediate priority is to kick off the plan to deprecate the existing \"login as\" feature and begin implementation of the new admin impersonation feature. This will eliminate the significant risk of accidentally charging customers and is an essential fast-follow to the AI credits launch. Brannen Huske will be working with the Agentic team, RevOps, and other stakeholders to finalize a simple plan to implement the unlimited AI credit promotion. This work is necessary to enable a key sales motion without over-engineering a solution for a short-term offering. The team will also focus on benchmarking competitors like Adobe to ensure the SCIM implementation achieves industry best-in-class standards, supporting the goal of a better GTM Workspace login experience.

## **PMM Engine Team Weekly Report - November 3, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

AJ Belen\'s team successfully completed the Go-to-Market Workspace rebrand with all assets updated and deployed to the field this week, including the finalized platform narrative deck that rolled out to sellers. The team is now pivoting to address a significant gap in AI Action Credit enablement: while foundational training on mechanics and pricing has been completed, sales lacks the positioning, talk tracks, and objection handling needed to actually sell credits effectively. Dominik Facher and Victor are escalating this to AR, Tuna, and James to drive urgency, with early signals showing substantial revenue potential---SurveyMonkey\'s usage would extrapolate to \$700K annually, and ZoomInfo\'s internal usage suggests \$350K in incremental revenue.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

Jennifer Scharrer finalized and shipped the platform narrative deck after incorporating Friday stakeholder feedback, with Ellie providing final design versions for upload to Seismic. The Go-to-Market Studio two-pager also reached completion this week and was delivered to Henry, addressing a standing request from field leadership.

AJ Belen led the sprint to update all collateral from \"Copilot Workspace\" to \"Go-to-Market Workspace,\" ensuring consistency across seismic, docket, and supporting documentation. The team completed this rebrand without any reported issues or gaps reaching the field, demonstrating strong execution under tight timelines.

Brett Jacobs made progress on the Voice of Customer tool despite technical setbacks, working with William on the chatbot team and Ryan Stevens on the Agentic platform to resolve timeout issues. The tool analyzed 700K+ customer conversations from Mid-Market Plus accounts over three months, surfacing pain point patterns that provide clear directional insight for product prioritization.

**Goals & Progress**

**GTM Studio & GTM Workspace**: The platform narrative deck is finalized and in the field, with the Go-to-Market Studio two-pager completed and delivered to Henry. Jennifer Scharrer kicked off deeper collaboration with Victor and Dylan Holliday to improve Workspace artifact output quality, focusing on standardizing five core artifact types with scalable design patterns. The team is establishing a knowledge management loop across docket, foundational documents, and messaging frameworks to ensure consistency as the product evolves.

**AI Action Credits**: Tria completed revisions on the economic buyer asset, with the end user version in progress. AJ Belen identified that sales has foundational knowledge of how credits work but lacks the positioning and talk tracks to sell them effectively---a gap that enablement considers resolved but the field experiences as incomplete. Victor, Adam, and Dominik aligned on escalating this to leadership, with plans to develop more offensive positioning assets involving Jennifer Scharrer and potentially Jesse Lindstrom plus an AE with prior AI credit selling experience.

**PMM Engine Infrastructure**: Brett Jacobs\' Voice of Customer tool hit implementation blockers this week related to processing large datasets through the Agentic platform, causing timeout issues in the micro app. The team is working through solutions but expects to encounter additional obstacles before achieving a sustainable, automated pipeline. Daniel is focusing on clarifying the knowledge loop process across stakeholders including Marcella, enablement, launch ops, and PMs to establish clear ownership of information updates.

**Strategic Challenges**

The AI Action Credit enablement gap represents a significant missed opportunity. Sales received training on mechanics and pricing---the foundational \"nuts and bolts\"---but lacks the value positioning, discovery questions, objection handling, and talk tracks needed to confidently sell credits. Enablement considers the work complete, while the field is equipped only for defensive conversations rather than proactive selling. With usage data showing SurveyMonkey on pace for \$700K annually and internal ZoomInfo usage suggesting \$350K in incremental revenue, this gap has material top-line implications. Dominik and Victor are engaging AR, Tuna, and James to drive alignment, and the team is exploring resources including Kyle Poirier (Growth Unhinged newsletter expert on product-led growth and credits) and Manny Medina\'s new AI credit platform company.

Brett Jacobs is struggling to identify which sales calls discussed Workspace and Studio at scale. Chorus tagging returns insufficient results, and the chatbot can\'t process enough calls to surface meaningful patterns---initial queries returned only four calls when significantly more exist. The team is working with Russell to analyze the approximately 7,000-8,000 accounts in territories owned by Lauderman, Lazer, and Lincoln, limiting scope from the full 40,000 account universe. If this approach doesn\'t succeed by Sunday, it signals a broader company capability gap since enablement requires this analysis for multiple use cases. The team can execute manual one-off analyses if needed, but establishing a sustainable, automated pipeline remains the objective.

Enablement continues operating reactively, fulfilling field requests as they arrive and pulling PMM into commitments without strategic resourcing discussions. Jennifer Scharrer flagged multiple instances this week where work was promised without PMM consultation, creating misalignment on priorities and capacity. The team agreed not to accept requests reflexively and to partner with enablement on strategic prioritization before committing resources.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

Early AI Action Credit usage data reveals compelling revenue expansion potential that strengthens the case for better enablement. SurveyMonkey\'s weekly usage, when extrapolated annually, suggests \$700K in incremental revenue from a single customer. ZoomInfo\'s internal usage across teams would generate approximately \$350K annually. These aren\'t small incremental gains but represent 50-70% growth trajectories that could meaningfully change forecasts. The gap between this potential and current sales capability makes positioning and talk track development an urgent priority rather than a nice-to-have follow-up to foundational training.

Jennifer Scharrer uncovered a key insight working with Victor on Workspace artifacts: the team wants chat outputs to more frequently produce artifacts rather than text responses, with these artifacts meeting or exceeding the quality of what sellers create manually. This requires standardizing design patterns across five core artifact types, bringing Jennifer\'s content and deck-building expertise to bear on making the outputs formulaic and scalable. This work has broader implications for product velocity since better default outputs reduce friction in seller adoption.

The team\'s release process thinking is evolving beyond traditional monthly cycles. Ken and Brett explored using GTM Studio and Workspace to personalize release communications at the account level---combining release information with account-specific data from Studio to help reps understand which updates matter for their customers. While this will likely surface product limitations, solving this use case would unlock numerous similar automation opportunities across the business. The team is building a proof-of-concept with one CSM ahead of the release workshop to demonstrate art-of-the-possible rather than delivering a finished solution.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

The team\'s relationship with enablement requires calibration around request intake and strategic prioritization. Multiple instances this week involved enablement committing PMM resources to field requests without prior consultation, then creating tension when PMM questioned the commitments. Emily\'s team recently reprimanded Jennifer Scharrer for working with Nikki/Kayla to upload content to Seismic without looping Emily in, despite the enablement team making the upload themselves. AJ Belen, Jennifer, and Brett agreed to push back on reactive requests and insist on strategic discussions before accepting new work, ensuring alignment on what moves the business forward versus simply fulfilling inbound demands.

Collaboration with Victor\'s team is deepening productively. Jennifer Scharrer is now supporting Victor and Dylan Holliday on improving Workspace artifact quality, bringing PMM expertise to product development in a way that should improve adoption outcomes. The team also needs clearer communication around the knowledge management loop across docket questions, foundational documents, and product updates, with Daniel working to establish shared understanding across Marcella, enablement, launch ops, and PM teams about ownership and processes.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week the team focuses on mapping out key activities for Workspace and Studio through year-end, moving from reactive firefighting to proactive planning. AJ Belen and Jennifer Scharrer will document what needs to happen and when, then socialize with Sneh and Victor to pressure-test assumptions and identify gaps.

Jennifer Scharrer continues supporting Victor on standardizing Workspace artifacts and will develop a launch process proposal while the team finalizes swim lanes ahead of Lauren\'s return. She\'s also committed to providing enablement with use case materials and historical context they\'ve been requesting. Brett Jacobs aims to unblock the Voice of Customer tool and roll it out to PMs next week, pending resolution of the timeout issues, and will review the tool with AJ, Jennifer, and Aksheth before communicating broadly. The team will also review the plan for identifying Workspace and Studio sales calls once Russell\'s analysis returns Sunday, escalating if the approach doesn\'t yield a sustainable solution.

The AI Action Credit positioning work represents the highest-leverage opportunity. Once Dominik and Victor secure leadership alignment with AR, Tuna, and James, Jennifer Scharrer will lead development of offensive positioning assets, potentially bringing in Jesse Lindstrom and the recently hired AE with AI credit experience. The team is also exploring external expertise from Kyle Poirier and examining Manny Medina\'s new AI credit platform for messaging insights. Getting sales equipped to proactively sell credits rather than just defend them could unlock 50-70% revenue growth trajectories based on early usage patterns.

## **Product Ops Executive Roundup - November 3, 2025**

**Executive Summary**

Frustrating week as the team encountered major data & infrastructure blockers this week that delayed the planned VOC tool rollout, automated release details, and analyzing Studio/Workspace calls so far, though viable solutions are now in hand and testing resumes this afternoon. Despite these setbacks, the team shipped some tangible wins: Kristin Gandini launched two major capabilities - the agentic platform prototyping tool for the organization and the automated tech documentation tool for the CX team using Github PRs and Jira ticket info, both now in active use. Ken Elwell had promising success running personalized release communication at scale through GTM Studio and Workspace, though some product gaps to work through. The week showcased the reality of building new things - unexpected technical challenges alongside concrete progress.

**This Week\'s Progress**

**Key Momentum Areas**

**Agentic Platform Prototyping Launch**: Kristin Gandini successfully launched the agentic platform prototyping tool to the organization, enabling PMs to build and prototype their own agents using whatever tools, artifacts, and prompts they want, then incorporate these directly into prototypes. The tool creates an unexpected benefit by using the real agentic platform, naturally injecting real data into prototypes and making them more realistic for planning purposes.

**CX Team Tech Documentation Automation**: Kristin Gandini launched the automated tech documentation tool with the CX team enablement group, who are now running with it independently. This marks the second production deployment this week of tools that directly benefit end stakeholders, demonstrating increasing operational maturity in delivering finished capabilities.

**GTM Studio Personalized Releases Success**: Ken Elwell successfully ran personalized releases through GTM Studio and Workspace, demonstrating the first working example of pushing information directly to the GTM team without middlemen. The workflow enables identifying which releases are most relevant to specific accounts and why, then delivering that context directly to where sellers execute. A few product gaps emerged during testing that need attention, but the core functionality works well and will be tested with CSMs next week.

**Goals & Progress**

**VOC Tool Infrastructure Resolution**: Brett Jacobs encountered major timeouts between the agentic platform and chatbot that blocked the planned VOC tool rollout. Sam Darcy spent the week addressing networking restrictions in the stack given the non-standard architecture with microapp front end, agentic layer, and MCP server for tool calls. As of this morning, a fix is available and being implemented. Sam is pushing out a workaround version this afternoon that uses the API to generate the fragments and entities needed, then imports results into the microapp, enabling testing to proceed while the permanent networking fix deploys.

**Pitch Talk Track Analysis Framework**: Ken Elwell developed the three-part framework for analyzing pitch effectiveness: identifying which calls pitched Studio or Workspace and getting call IDs, gathering full transcripts for those calls since summaries won\'t capture specific rep language, and analyzing the transcripts at scale. Russell is working on unblocking the most challenging part - identifying relevant calls at scale - with an update expected Sunday. BigQuery provides a viable path for transcript retrieval once call IDs are identified.

**Automated Release Information Data Blockers**: Daniel Kong sent out communications and aligned stakeholders on responsibilities for the product knowledge system rollout, including quick phone calls with Randy and the TPM team to resolve initial confusion. The focus shifted to automated product release information, but Daniel hit blockers on the data side. This work relates to Kristin Gandini\'s tech release automation tool that uses GitHub PRs and Jira ticket information, where Kristin worked with technical support people to establish the data flow. Daniel needs to see the actual data from Dan\'s team but faces permission access issues - when downloads do work, files sometimes contain only null values, making it impossible to determine what\'s possible to create.

**VOC Workflow Proposal Development**: Kristin Gandini shared a proposal for an ongoing VOC workflow focused on top customer feedback and continued building out the top-down report capabilities. Token limit challenges persist in ZI Chat when using large system prompts, but the core workflow structure for collecting Jira tickets and enabling deeper investigation into specific feedback areas is mapped out and ready for testing once infrastructure limitations are resolved.

**Strategic Challenges**

**Data Access Dependencies Blocking Product Release Automation**: Daniel Kong remains blocked waiting to see data from Dan\'s team before being able to design the automated product release information system. Permission access issues prevent downloading needed data, and when downloads do work, the files sometimes lack the necessary information. The time zone and weekend differences with the offshore team require quick morning feedback rounds to maintain progress, but without seeing the actual data structure and content, it\'s difficult to determine what\'s possible to create and how to integrate into existing workflows.

**Token Limit Constraints in VOC Agents**: Kristin Gandini continues hitting token limits in ZI Chat when trying to run agents with large system prompts and CSV data for the top-down VOC report workflow. The system prompt is too large even before adding any actual analysis data. Brett Jacobs suggested workarounds including splitting datasets by theme and filtering CSV data to remove uncategorized fragments (about 30% of content), but this requires engagement with the chat team to find a sustainable solution that maintains analytical depth.

**Pitch Call Identification at Scale**: Ken Elwell faces the challenge of identifying which calls discussed GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace at scale to enable pitch effectiveness analysis. While transcript gathering and analysis appear tractable once call IDs are available, determining which calls are relevant from the full corpus is proving harder than expected. Russell\'s analysis will determine whether the semantic pipeline or Chorus API provides a viable path, with the complication that semantic data contains fragments rather than full transcripts, potentially requiring reconstruction of complete conversations.

**Strategic Insights**

**Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Direct GTM Enablement Opportunity**: Ken Elwell discovered this is the first time he has actually needed to use ZoomInfo products rather than just looking around at them, revealing a valuable opportunity. The GTM Studio to Workspace flow creates a direct channel to push information to the GTM team without middlemen, enabling Product Ops to leverage deep release knowledge to identify relevant account implications and deliver actionable context directly where sellers execute.

**Agentic Platform Prototyping Side Benefits**: Kristin Gandini found that the agentic platform prototyping tools create a valuable side benefit beyond their primary purpose. Because they use the real agentic platform, they naturally inject real data into prototypes, making them more realistic for planning purposes. This bridges a long-standing gap where prototypes often felt artificial and disconnected from actual system capabilities.

**Communication Mode Effectiveness**: Daniel Kong validated that aligning via quick calls is much more effective than sending long messages via Slack, though sometimes both are necessary. The phone conversations with Randy and the TPM team quickly resolved confusion that written communications had created, establishing clear role boundaries and workflow expectations that might have taken multiple message rounds to achieve.

**Infrastructure Complexity Reality**: Brett Jacobs articulated the learning that many things that seem like they should be easy turn out to be hard, citing examples like identifying calls that discussed specific products or resolving timing and gateway issues. The team lacks clear patterns for solving these types of problems, making it difficult to estimate effort or identify when to escalate versus persist. This uncertainty complicates planning and creates frustration when straightforward-seeming work reveals hidden complexity.

**Cross-Team Dependencies**

Russell\'s work on identifying relevant pitch calls will be sent Sunday, providing the foundation for Ken Elwell\'s talk track analysis work. The approach Russell develops for this problem will likely inform similar use cases requiring selective call identification from large conversation datasets.

Dan\'s team controls access to the product release data that Daniel Kong needs to build the automated release information system. The permission and data format issues are blocking progress on a system with substantial downstream value for both Product Ops and the broader organization.

The chat team\'s involvement will be necessary to resolve Kristin Gandini\'s token limit issues, as current workarounds degrade the user experience and analytical capability. The CSV size and system prompt length are both contributing factors that need architectural solutions beyond individual optimizations.

**Looking Ahead**

Next week focuses on recovering momentum after this week\'s infrastructure setbacks while pushing forward on multiple workstreams that are now unblocked or have clear paths forward.

**VOC Tool Testing and Deployment**: Brett Jacobs and Kristin Gandini will test the VOC extension this afternoon once the front end is ready, with Brett needing to leave at 2:30 to pick up Elise. Despite expecting to encounter more issues based on this week\'s experience, there is high confidence that the underlying functionality works well and the remaining challenges center on deployment and user interface refinements rather than fundamental design problems. Sam Darcy\'s workaround enables testing to proceed before the permanent networking fix is in place.

**CSM Testing of Personalized Releases**: Ken Elwell plans to test the personalized release flow with actual CSMs next week, building on this week\'s successful run-through of the GTM Studio to Workspace functionality. The test will use a real CSM (likely Zach Day, who has been discussing AI capabilities with Ken) to validate whether personalized account summaries can effectively reach reps and be actionable in their territory planning. The few product gaps identified this week need attention, but the core capability is proven and ready for real-world validation.

**Product Release Automation Data Acquisition**: Daniel Kong will focus intensively on the product release automation work, needing to see the actual data and figure out what is possible to create and how to bring it into existing workflows. The goal for next week is having knowledge bases updated with automated release information, including replicating Joggin\'s newsletter automation. Kristin Gandini will also work on bridging the gap between automated weekly releases and the LRT piece, as this backtracking is becoming increasingly necessary given Mary\'s feedback.

**Top-Down VOC Report Rollout**: Brett Jacobs will begin rolling out the top-down report workflow while continuing to refine the VOC tool based on testing results. Kristin Gandini will focus on ensuring the workflow can stand up whenever the tool is fully ready, and will spend time investigating how to enable PMs to use VOC for further discovery beyond the tactical execution focus of the top-down report. The real value multiplier comes from setting up infrastructure that PMs can use independently, similar to Klein, rather than from one-off report generation.

The team demonstrated resilience this week by identifying workarounds for major blockers while still shipping two production capabilities. The focus on unblocking dependencies and validating real world workflows positions next week for significant progress across multiple initiatives, with clearer understanding of both technical constraints and user needs informing the path forward.
