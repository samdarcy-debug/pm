DAI Executive Roundup - August 18th -
August 21st, 2025

Executive Summary

Copilot V2 narrative control is now our highest priority - GTM teams are asking urgent questions
about pricing, rollout strategy, and positioning after internal demos spread beyond the intended
audience. Victor Oliveros has aligned rollout strategy with leadership and will demo to sales
leaders Monday, but we need immediate executive coordination to prevent mixed messaging
that could undermine Q3/Q4 renewals. Gartner Revenue Action Orchestration Magic Quadrant
demo performed well Tuesday, positioning us as potential leaders quadrant candidates.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Victor Oliveros delivered a strong Gartner MQ demo performance Tuesday, demonstrating
ZoomInfo's expanded platform capabilities beyond prospecting data. The team expects
placement in either the challengers or leaders quadrant, with particular strength in top-of-funnel
and sales coaching capabilities through Chorus integration. This positions us well for changing
external market perception.

Dominik Facher reports October data release momentum is building with Company 3.0
infrastructure coming together. Multiple long-running initiatives are converging, including rebuilt
data pipelines and enhanced company data quality. The team has also established promising
flywheel partnerships, with OneMind moving quickly toward two new data streams in the next
few weeks.

Sneh Kakileti's GTM Studio early access program now has 10 customers actively using the
product, with expectations to reach 25-30 customers by mid-September. Customer feedback
validates core features including engagement data and agentic experiences, with particular
strength in new business account planning and prioritization use cases for Q4.

Goals & Progress

Copilot V2 Rollout Strategy: Victor Oliveros achieved 95% completion on GTM rollout and
PMM asset strategy, establishing clear cohort criteria and positioning framework. Sales
leadership demo scheduled for Monday will jumpstart controlled rollout to high-value renewal
customers starting late September/October. AJ Belen is coordinating enablement conversations
to ensure proper activity ownership and prevent scope creep.

Technical Infrastructure: Ali Sadat made limited progress on Copilot V2 engineering alignment
due to competing priorities, maintaining the same goal for next week. Critical discussions
continue with Majid and Nebo on query architecture and CRM writebacks. Brandon Tucker
achieved 80% progress on Company 3.0 strategy memo, with clear resource allocation for
shared services and location data improvements.

Early Access Execution: Sneh Kakileti reached 20% goal completion on GTM Studio demo
paths and roadmap clarity. Two critical infrastructure gaps emerged: need for centralized
orchestrator for agentic tools/datasets, and inconsistent first-party data flows across product
touchpoints causing customer confusion during export processes.

Strategic Challenges

Cross-functional coordination gaps are consuming disproportionate time relative to technical
complexity, particularly around contributory network data ingestion and partnership processes.
Brandon Tucker reports 6-week procurement cycles that overwhelm smaller partners with
security and legal requirements inappropriate for data partnerships. The team is working directly
with procurement to streamline processes, with vendor relationships as the initial test case for
an accelerated model.

Engineering resource clarity remains incomplete despite all-hands communication efforts. Team
members report uncertainty about H2 priorities and connections between individual work and
broader objectives. While strategic direction exists, the operating cadence and DRI assignments
need refinement to ensure consistent execution understanding across all teams.

Customer performance and scale concerns are escalating as GTM Studio usage increases.
Sneh Kakileti reports growing customer questions about service timing, workbook processing
duration, and error handling. These issues weren't critical during early testing but require Q4
attention as the customer base expands to 25-30 active users.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

Data platform architecture is becoming more modular and service-oriented, enabling faster
integration of new datasets and attributes. Dominik Facher notes this shift from tightly integrated
systems to platform/consumer models will accelerate custom dataset delivery and vertical use
case support. The shared services framework, once properly resourced, will benefit multiple
teams including Studio's data management needs.
Identity graph capabilities have reached market-leading status, creating partnership
opportunities beyond direct competition. The Pipedrive discussions illustrate how ZoomInfo can
serve market segments we wouldn't directly pursue while building contributory network effects.
These PLG/enrichment partnerships could unlock significant data value with minimal customer
acquisition costs.

Customer onboarding patterns reveal GTM Studio's learning curve validation from early access
users like Brex. The platform requires simplified enablement approaches rather than intensive
training programs. This insight is driving product decisions toward more intuitive workflows and
better contextual guidance within the application.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with integrations and connectors teams continues to be critical for GTM Studio early
access program support. Export functionality and CRM connectivity issues directly impact
customer experience during the critical onboarding phase. Current dependencies on Platform
team resolution of Hubspot opportunity data health issues are blocking ROI analytics progress
for affected customers.

Enablement team coordination requires immediate attention as they've developed broad rollout
plans that don't align with our focused cohort strategy for both Copilot V2 and GTM Studio. AJ
Belen reports 35-slide presentations and all-hands approaches that contradict our product-led
motion strategy. Executive alignment needed on messaging ownership and activity boundaries.

Looking Ahead

Next week focuses on controlling the Copilot V2 narrative through precise sales leader
engagement and enablement alignment. Victor Oliveros will conduct the Monday demo while AJ
Belen drives conversations with enablement leadership to establish proper boundaries and
expectations.

GTM Studio momentum continues building toward September soft launch with Sneh Kakileti
driving alignment with sales and customer success leadership on Q4 support motions.
Performance and scale improvements become critical as customer base approaches 30 active
users. The team will prioritize error handling and processing transparency to maintain positive
early access experience.

Engineering priorities and resource allocation require final clarity to maintain H2 execution
momentum. While strategic direction is solid, operational details and individual contributor
understanding need reinforcement to prevent execution drift. The upcoming engineering
alignment sessions will establish clear DRI assignments and milestone dependencies.
