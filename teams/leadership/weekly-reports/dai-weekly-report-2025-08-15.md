DAI Executive Roundup - [August 11th -
August 15th, 2025]

Executive Summary

The Gartner Magic Quadrant demo on Tuesday positions ZoomInfo for a potential
upper-right placement in the consolidated Revenue Action Orchestration category,
fundamentally shifting our market perception from data provider to GTM platform. Victor
Oliveros and Sneh Kakileti have unified our entire product surface area into a compelling
narrative that leverages workbooks, Account AI, and Chorus momentum view to score 75/100
on forecasting despite lacking a true forecasting tool. The SalesLoft-Clary merger creates a 2-3
year integration nightmare for competitors, clearing our path to market leadership. However,
internal confusion around Copilot V2 rollout timing has activated hundreds of people without
proper coordination, requiring immediate narrative control.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Adam Smith's team rebuilt the foundational Copilot orchestration agents over the
weekend, delivering a demo-ready experience that confidently showcases end-to-end
workflows from UI to chat output. The engineering team worked 18 consecutive days to
overcome Friday's critical failures, resulting in consistent, high-quality agent performance that
eliminates the dice-rolling uncertainty that previously plagued demos. Henry and James Roth's
positive reception validates both the renewal potential and sales viability of our agentic platform.

Brandon Tucker finalized the target account list for vertical datasets, unlocking a clear
path to $10M+ incremental H2 revenue through 300+ qualified accounts across
restaurant, franchise, and contractor segments. The team resolved critical franchise data
matching blockers and secured an S&P Global Mobility partnership for best-in-market fleet data,
transforming a zero-revenue assumption into a significant upside opportunity. Dow is already
engaging account managers on the highest-potential accounts with comprehensive tracking of
every touchpoint.

Ali Sadat established architectural clarity on the Query API and datasets delivery, with
Majid leading end-to-end architecture and weekly engineering reviews driving toward
October phase 1 completion. The GraphQL metadata-driven approach provides a scalable
foundation that preserves existing federated search investments while enabling future
expansion. Clear requirements alignment with Adam Smith's team on Copilot V2 data retrieval
creates a solid technical path forward.

Goals & Progress

Gartner Magic Quadrant Positioning: Victor Oliveros achieved 75% completion on the
Revenue Action Orchestration demo, successfully unifying ZoomInfo's entire product ecosystem
into a coherent go-to-market platform narrative. The AI-assisted questionnaire drafting
accelerated preparation, and the consolidated quadrant format plays to our strengths in
prospecting while competitors struggle with integration challenges. Sneh Kakileti's partnership
on demo script development ensures technical depth matches marketing messaging.

Copilot V2 Development Momentum: Adam Smith's team achieved breakthrough consistency
in agent performance after weekend infrastructure rebuild, moving from unreliable dice-rolling to
production-ready demonstrations. The pricing model with Mark Harris progressed significantly,
establishing flexible AI credit architecture that scales across Studio and Copilot without
foundational restarts. However, sales readiness requires additional rough-edge polishing
beyond demo-specific implementations.

Vertical Datasets Revenue Engine: Brandon Tucker delivered 90% completion on target
account qualification, with V1 lists finalized and franchise data matching blockers resolved. The
self-serve cube evaluation capability removes manual bottlenecks that previously slowed
customer engagement. S&P Global Mobility partnership expands addressable market beyond
initial projections, while systematic AM touchpoint tracking ensures no qualified opportunity falls
through execution gaps.

Strategic Challenges

Internal narrative control has become critical as Copilot V2 excitement generated
hundreds of activated stakeholders without coordination, creating chaos that threatens
execution focus. Random employees are scheduling training sessions on non-existent
products, and one-on-one Slack responses from PMM team members scale poorly, generating
telephone-game misinformation. The organization's nervousness around short timeframes
justifies the anxiety, but requires top-down narrative ownership rather than reactive individual
responses to restore order.

Query API confusion persists across teams, with conflicting timelines from "end of year"
to "available in August" creating engineering uncertainty and blocking dependent work
streams. The federated search versus GraphQL API distinction needs clarity for consuming
teams to make informed decisions. While Ali Sadat's narrowed scope on datasets provides
focus, broader GTM data model requirements remain unresolved, potentially impacting
workbook team integration post-September.

GTM Studio's current chat implementation directly interacts with workbook pipelines,
limiting agentic capabilities to existing data source connections rather than enabling
general-purpose research and list building. Sneh Kakileti identified this as a fundamental
pattern that must be generalized for true agentic value - today's implementation cannot support
workflows like "research Dreamforce sponsors and find VPs of event marketing," which
represents the core value proposition for Q4 sales planning use cases.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

The Gartner Magic Quadrant consolidation creates an unexpected opportunity for market
leadership, as ZoomInfo checks more boxes than initially anticipated across the
expanded category scope. Victor Oliveros discovered our workbooks, Account AI, and Chorus
integration provide credible forecasting capabilities that score significantly higher than expected.
The SalesLoft-Clary merger represents a survival deal rather than offensive strategy, with
Vista's cost-cutting mandate forcing immediate engineering relocation to India and creating 2-3
year integration paralysis for key competitors.

Q4 sales planning and territory building emerges as the optimal positioning for GTM
Studio, aligning product capabilities with seasonal timing and ops-focused personas.
Sneh Kakileti's analysis of successful customer demos reveals that account-specific attribute
preparation and use case-driven flows generate the strongest engagement. This seasonal focus
provides clear messaging differentiation from Copilot V2's seller-focused capabilities while
leveraging Studio's current technical strengths.

Website buyer ID represents our most compelling signal for immediate monetization, yet
lacks sufficient product surface area for customers to experience its value. Dominik
Facher identified this as easily a few million dollars in new business opportunity, requiring
signal-based workbooks, API access, and MCP integration to create end-to-end customer
value. The identity graph improvements and real-time resolution capabilities provide competitive
differentiation that remains largely invisible in current product interfaces.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with engineering teams on agentic platform stability continues to be critical for both
Copilot V2 and GTM Studio success. Adam Smith's weekend rebuild demonstrates the
engineering team's commitment, but maintaining momentum requires continued focus on
customer-ready polish beyond demo-specific implementations. The credit system architecture
under Brandon Tucker and Ali Sadat's teams needs completion to enable proper consumption
tracking across all AI-powered features.

Partnership execution with S&P Global Mobility and vertical dataset partners requires legal and
procurement process optimization to avoid the current 6+ week contract cycles that overwhelm
smaller partners. Brandon Tucker identified this as a bottleneck for the broader flywheel partner
strategy, where procurement complexity burns relationships before signature completion.
Looking Ahead

Next week's primary focus centers on controlling the Copilot V2 narrative through
executive-driven communication while maintaining engineering momentum toward
customer readiness. Victor Oliveros, Adam Smith, Sneh Kakileti, and Dominik Facher will
create a rollout schedule asset that provides clarity on access timing, asset delivery, and training
availability to address organizational anxiety and eliminate counterproductive individual
responses.

The Gartner Magic Quadrant demo on Tuesday represents a pivotal moment for market
repositioning, requiring final alignment between product capabilities and messaging
strategy. Success here fundamentally shifts ZoomInfo's perception from data provider to GTM
platform leader, providing significant pipeline generation and competitive differentiation.
Post-demo execution must immediately capitalize on this positioning through coordinated sales
enablement and customer messaging.

GTM Studio's September soft launch preparation demands resolution of the agentic
platform limitations and signal-based workbook delivery to unlock Q4 sales planning use
cases. Sneh Kakileti's demo script completion and workbook library development create the
foundation for seasonal positioning, while technical dependencies on query APIs and
general-purpose research capabilities determine feature completeness. The intersection of
these initiatives with Copilot V2 rollout requires careful coordination to avoid market confusion
and maximize combined impact.
