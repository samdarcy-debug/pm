DAI Executive Roundup - [Monday
September 8, 2025 - Friday September 12,
2025]

Executive Summary

The team delivered significant progress on partnership strategy with Adobe and Outreach while
maintaining strong momentum across data initiatives, but coordination challenges are emerging
as we scale multiple AI products simultaneously. Adobe discussions advanced to concrete
reselling proposals with potential ZIM integration synergies, while Outreach alignment cleared
marketing messaging blockers for their broader launch. However, cross-functional coordination
gaps - particularly around legal, security, and engineering alignment on data initiatives - are
consuming disproportionate time relative to technical complexity and require immediate
attention to prevent development paralysis.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Partnership Strategy Gains Traction: Ali Sadat successfully advanced discussions with
Adobe, securing a concrete reselling proposal and identifying technical delivery pathways
through collaboration with sales and product teams. The Adobe partnership now presents dual
opportunities - both platform integration and potential ZIM synergies that weren't initially
proposed but could drive significant revenue impact.

Franchise Dataset Production Reset Accelerates Delivery: Brandon Tucker completed a
comprehensive reset of the franchise dataset production process, establishing new team
structures, validation protocols, and order of operations that immediately improved output
quality. The team now has a reusable sample covering 20 diverse franchisors and is positioned
to complete samples for the top 50 franchisors, with clear plans to leverage Solutions
Consultants and Data Services teams for scaled execution.

AI Credits Implementation Maintains September Timeline: Despite ongoing technical
discussions, Sneh Kakileti confirmed that AI credits implementation remains on track for
end-of-September delivery with little buffer. The team successfully aligned sales leadership and
enablement teams on GTM Studio readiness timelines, establishing dedicated Solution
Consultant environments for demos and clearing the path for paid proof-of-concept motions.
Goals & Progress

Partnership Development: Ali Sadat achieved 80% completion on Adobe and Outreach
partnerships this week. Adobe discussions progressed to commercial negotiations involving
sales and partner teams, with clear technical delivery paths identified through Product. Outreach
alignment was successfully completed, resolving marketing messaging conflicts that had
blocked their broader launch capabilities. The focus shifts to operationalizing ISV partnership
processes with Andres to handle the expected influx of partnership opportunities.

Vertical Data Acceleration: Brandon Tucker made substantial progress with 50% goal
completion, establishing a complete reset on franchise dataset processes that immediately
improved quality and speed. The team successfully transferred work streams to new teams for
acceleration, completed a three-hour intensive session, and established clear pathways to
leverage Solutions Consultants and Data Services for scaled support. GTM.AI launch
preparations are advancing with significant remaining work on existing dataset content.

GTM Studio Sales Readiness: Sneh Kakileti successfully aligned with sales leadership and
enablement teams on field readiness timelines and plans, establishing clear coordination with
Antuna and AR's teams. The team configured dedicated Solution Consultant environments for
GTM Studio demos and established clear talk track and demo paths for the Solution Consultant
team. September release preparations are on track for production deployment on 9/23, with
paid proof-of-concept motions being developed.

Strategic Challenges

Cross-Functional Coordination Complexity: The team's work on data ingestion, website key
buyer ID requirements, and partnership integration processes reveals systematic challenges in
aligning legal, security, and engineering stakeholders around data initiatives. These coordination
gaps are consuming disproportionate time relative to the technical complexity of the work itself,
creating bottlenecks that could impact multiple product timelines. Brandon Tucker's experience
with flywheel partner opportunities demonstrates the need for streamlined processes that don't
overwhelm smaller partners with extensive security and legal requirements.

Multi-Product Positioning Clarity Needs: AJ Belen identified that sales leaders are requesting
unified platform narratives that encompass not just AI products like Copilot V2, GTM Studio, and
GTM Context Service, but also existing solutions like Ringlead, Chorus, and ZIM. The team
needs practical sales motion guidance that clarifies when to lead with which products for
specific customer scenarios, personas, and lifecycle stages. This positioning challenge reflects
the broader complexity of managing multiple product launches simultaneously while maintaining
clear market messaging.

Engineering Resource Allocation Questions: Multiple team members highlighted resource
constraints and coordination challenges across engineering teams. Dominik Facher noted that
advanced search migration work is creating resource allocation questions about whether to
invest in current systems or defer until retirement, while teams need immediate architectural
decisions to prevent feature development paralysis. The query layer confusion mentioned by
Dominik specifically around federated search capabilities requires clarification to avoid repeated
setbacks.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

Partnership Operations Require Strategic Simplification: The Adobe and Outreach
experiences revealed that partnership operations need fundamental restructuring to match the
speed and complexity requirements of modern data partnerships. Traditional procurement and
security processes that work for infrastructure purchases create unnecessary barriers for data
partnerships, where risk profiles are fundamentally different. Brandon Tucker's insight about
taking 6+ weeks from intention to signature, often burning partnerships with smaller businesses
due to process overhead, highlights the need for differentiated approaches based on
partnership type and risk profile.

AI Credits Present Unprecedented Revenue Model Opportunities: Dominik Facher's
strategic observation about AI credits creating powerful revenue opportunities through
distribution strategies represents a fundamental shift in business model thinking. The insight
that the team could distribute tools widely and monetize through usage rather than licenses
challenges traditional software sales approaches, but requires sales team education and
confidence-building around a model they've never sold before. This creates both opportunity
and organizational change management challenges.

Data Integration Capabilities Are Becoming Competitive Differentiators: Ali Sadat's
progress on unified profile and GTM query interfaces, combined with Brandon Tucker's work on
dataset production processes, demonstrates that data integration speed and quality are
becoming key competitive advantages. The ability to rapidly incorporate new datasets, respond
to custom data requests, and maintain high data quality through automated processes directly
impacts win rates and customer satisfaction. The technical foundation work on GTM Data
Manager and query APIs is creating capabilities that competitors cannot easily replicate.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with Salesforce on data integration initiatives continues to show significant potential
for revenue expansion through deeper platform integration. Dominik Facher's observation about
the query layer creating unique value propositions - particularly around signal stacking
capabilities that don't exist elsewhere - positions these collaborations as strategic differentiators
rather than tactical partnerships.

The Adobe partnership discussions have revealed additional opportunities for ZIM integration
that weren't initially proposed but could create compound value across multiple product lines. Ali
Sadat's work with the partner and sales teams is identifying synergies that could significantly
amplify the revenue impact of individual partnerships through integrated go-to-market
approaches.

Looking Ahead

Next week's priorities center on consolidating the partnership momentum while ensuring
execution readiness across multiple product launches. The Adobe partnership requires
continued commercial and technical alignment sessions, while the Outreach success creates
opportunities to systematize ISV partnership operations for scalable growth.

The franchise dataset work represents a critical proof point for vertical data monetization
strategies, with Brandon Tucker's process improvements creating a foundation for rapid dataset
expansion. The team's ability to complete top 50 franchisor samples while simultaneously
establishing scalable processes will demonstrate whether the $10M+ vertical data revenue
target is achievable. Simultaneously, the GTM Studio September release represents a crucial
milestone for AI product market readiness, with Sneh Kakileti's alignment work with sales
leadership creating the foundation for successful field adoption.

The technical foundation work on query layers and data integration capabilities continues to
build competitive moats that will become increasingly valuable as AI product adoption scales.
The combination of improved data processing speed, enhanced integration capabilities, and
simplified partner onboarding processes positions the organization to capitalize on market
opportunities more effectively than competitors who lack these foundational capabilities.
