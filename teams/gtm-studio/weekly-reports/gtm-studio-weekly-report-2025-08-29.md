# **GTM Studio Executive Roundup - 08/29/2025** 

## **Executive Summary**

**GTM Studio approached September GA with strong execution momentum but
revealed critical customer activation gaps requiring immediate field
readiness intervention.** The team achieved 81.3% average goal
completion, with standout performances from Tanvi Vaidya (100%) and Sneh
Kakileti (100%) driving October preparation and sales alignment
initiatives. However, customer feedback sessions exposed a fundamental
challenge: users struggle to activate studio-generated insights with
sellers, asking \"How do I get talking points and next best actions to
sellers?\" Meanwhile, Data Management team's analysis identified a
cross-sell/upsell opportunity with \~4K existing ZI customers, while
agent capabilities moved toward production deployment by Wednesday,
positioning the product for September readiness.

## **This Week\'s Progress**

### **Key Momentum Areas**

**September GA Preparation and October Pipeline**: Tanvi Vaidya
delivered 100% completion transferring October backlog items to Jira
while coordinating engineering reviews and customer kickoff call
insights. Her systematic approach to post-GA feature preparation created
clear development pipeline continuity, while customer use case
documentation from early access programs provided valuable validation
for upcoming capabilities. This preparation work ensures seamless
transition from September delivery to sustained development momentum.

**Sales Leadership Alignment and Field Readiness**: Sneh Kakileti
achieved 100% completion securing sales leadership alignment for Q4 GTM
Studio motions, establishing launch goals with SC and AM leadership
teams. His field readiness initiative addresses the critical customer
challenge around seller activation, moving from product capabilities to
practical implementation support. This alignment creates the foundation
for scalable customer success as the product transitions from
development to market deployment.

**Revenue Opportunity Validation and Data Management Strategy**: Brahm
Kohli reached 80% completion with significant strategic breakthroughs
including \~4K customers for cross-sell/upsell opportunity
identification through Manu Pari\'s analysis and successful AM
leadership review with Stephen Antuna on latest of ROI analytics. The
ROI enablement materials handoff to Gabe Sweet\'s team and FAQ agent
staging deployment demonstrate progress on multiple fronts, while the
data management milestone view provides clear execution framework for
Chad Coleman\'s analytics team on the POC for Data Health Scan.

### **Goals & Progress**

**Agent Platform Production Readiness**: Jagannath Ramesh advanced agent
capabilities toward Wednesday production deployment despite achieving
60% completion due to SFDC MCP leadership decision delays and
performance issue reprioritization. His CSV transformation BigQuery POC
breakthrough enables workbook generation from unlimited data processing,
creating powerful DaaS integration opportunities. The quality focus
shift positions agent capabilities for stable customer deployment.

**Activation and Integration Development**: Mohan Sun and Veronica
Hudson progressed on multiple activation pathways with Copilot export
requirement alignment and technical feasibility discussions with Marc
Frail, Sean Walter and Nebojsa Bogdanovic, while workflow experience
reviews established the UX foundation for seamless data activation to
external destinations. Customer feedback sessions with Brex, Adobe and
ZI Labs provided validation for activation approaches, though
Outreach/Salesloft activation research initiation remains pending due to
resource prioritization.

**Data Foundation and Partnership Evolution**: Corina Soto achieved
mixed results with partner data QA experiencing delays due to count
aggregation dependencies, though successful name change to \"Add-On
datasets\" improves user clarity. Her data management work reached 70%
completion with Milestone definitions on AI data management, engineering
estimates coordination and target account identification for presales
motions. The route service discovery for plays functionality represents
unexpected efficiency gain through existing RingLead engineering
components. More to be defined next week along with Engineering.

### **Strategic Challenges**

**Customer Activation and Seller Enablement Gap**: The most critical
challenge emerged from customer feedback revealing fundamental
activation barriers where users cannot effectively translate
studio-generated insights into seller actions. Customers consistently
ask \"How do I get talking points and next best actions to sellers?\"
indicating a gap between product capabilities and practical field
implementation. This represents a core product-market fit concern
requiring immediate field readiness and customer success intervention.

**Technical Infrastructure and Decision Dependencies**: Multiple
technical blockers require executive resolution, including SFDC MCP
strategic decision pending with leadership that affects integration
roadmap progression. Performance gaps identified for September GA
readiness need systematic resolution, while GTM Data Model engineering
evaluation continues for ROI analytics. Additionally, routing
functionality development needs better coordination along with the
RingLead Engineering team. Discussions lined up for next week.

**Resource Coordination and Holiday Impact**: The shortened holiday week
created execution challenges with Corina Soto\'s partner data QA blocked
on engineering dependencies, while performance issue resolution required
reprioritization affecting other development streams.

**Strategic Insights**

### **Key Learnings & Discoveries**

**Incremental Revenue Opportunity in Data Management**: Data Management
team's analysis with Manu Pari revealed \~4K customers for potential
cross-sell/upsell opportunity, representing business impact potential
for data management initiatives. The milestone view framework provides a
clear execution pathway for capturing this opportunity, while target
account identification enables focused presales motion development with
sales team coordination. Discussions with presales, sales and CSM/AM
leadership in progress.

**Agent Architecture Breakthrough for Unlimited Processing**: Jagannath
Ramesh\'s CSV transformation BigQuery POC demonstrates capability to
process unlimited data volumes while generating multiple workbook sheets
from million-record files. This architectural advancement removes
previous processing constraints and enables enterprise-scale data
manipulation through agent interfaces, significantly expanding
addressable use cases for GTM Studio capabilities.

**Customer Success Challenge Requires Field Evolution**: Customer
feedback consistently reveals that technical activation capabilities are
insufficient without accompanying seller enablement and field
implementation support. Users can generate insights but cannot
effectively operationalize them within existing sales processes,
indicating need for enhanced customer success resources and field
training programs to drive adoption success.

**Fundamental Architecture Pivot for Copilot Integration:** Technical
discovery revealed that the original Workflow-based approach for
Studio-to-Copilot data transmission is incompatible with Copilot\'s
architecture. A new solution leveraging GraphQL queries through GTM Data
Store is decided instead, creating a direct pipeline from GTM Studio to
seller-specific Copilot Views. This pivot requires resolution in Studio
assignment functionality (development of routing features) while
introducing timeline risk due to the late-stage architectural decision,
with next week\'s GraphQL POC now on critical path for October launch
feasibility.

### **Cross-Team Dependencies**

Sales leadership coordination with Stephen Antuna\'s team and Gabe
Sweet\'s enablement organization becomes critical for addressing
customer activation gaps and ensuring successful field deployment. The
AM leadership alignment secured by Sneh Kakileti requires continued
coordination to translate strategic alignment into tactical execution
support for customers struggling with seller implementation.

Intelligence Platform collaboration continues requiring resolution of
SFDC MCP strategic decisions and performance optimization coordination.
Chad Coleman\'s analytics team continues to support data management
efforts for POC phase.

## **Looking Ahead**

The team enters September GA with strong technical foundation but
critical field readiness requirements demanding immediate attention.
Focus shifts from product development to customer success and market
readiness as activation challenges require systematic resolution.
