SalesOS/Copilot Executive Roundup -
[August 18th - August 21st, 2025]

Executive Summary

Intent Topic AI Recommendation feature successfully launched to 100% of eligible customers
with immediate recommendations available for ~3,000 accounts. Harinath Krishnamoorthy
delivered the full rollout with comprehensive monitoring systems in place.

While where we end up in the Gartner MQ is unknown, Gabe Pirela's Gartner Magic Quadrant
demo performance positioned us strongly for potential "Leaders" quadrant placement, with
forecasting/pipeline management capabilities as the biggest questionmark.

Key challenge: AI emailer prototype quality still needs significant improvement before
engineering handoff, requiring human-level output standards to drive user adoption.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Intent recommendations went live across our entire customer base without critical incidents,
representing a major step toward AI-driven user guidance. Harinath delivered not just the
feature launch but established measurement frameworks through Amplitude events and
Snowflake pipelines, enabling weekly adoption tracking. The 30-60% relevancy rate provides a
baseline for iterative improvements while giving 3,000 customers immediate value.

Adam Severance completed Copilot internal access program setup, clearing the path for
September's external customer beta. The AccountAI upgrade wave processed ~800 customers
successfully, demonstrating our ability to execute large-scale product improvements. These
operational wins build confidence for the upcoming GTM Copilot launch targeting $61M in
renewals through year-end.

Ant Cuomo's company profiles redesign work with Katya is uncovering significant opportunities
to improve information presentation in GTM Copilot. Their daily 90-minute design sessions are
yielding fresh approaches to profile architecture, particularly around intent integration. The
mobile mapping feature discovery - despite being shelved due to location data quality issues -
highlighted both our data gaps and the substantial market opportunity in field sales route
optimization.

Goals & Progress
GTM Copilot V2 Development: Adam achieved 70% completion on onboarding experience
designs despite designer availability constraints, with clear dependencies on GTMC design
coordination. The internal access rollout is complete, positioning us for controlled external beta
launch. Copilot V2 represents our flagship effort to unify disparate experiences that have
historically limited adoption rates.

AI Agent Development: Gabe progressed to 50% on emailer iteration with engineering team
now ready to take the prototype forward on the Agentic platform. However, output quality
remains below human SDR standards, requiring systematic improvement against gold-standard
email examples. The engagement insights prototype reached 25% completion, focusing on
identifying the 4-5 critical questions users need answered about account-level engagement
patterns.

Enterprise Infrastructure: David advanced admin-defined territories to 50% completion with
successful beta customer onboarding and positive initial feedback. The territories system
already integrates with workflows for routing, validating the technical approach. Priority accounts
work reached 25% completion as engineering teams converge on GTM data model integration
approach, though product alignment on search infrastructure access remains ongoing.

Strategic Challenges

AI emailer quality represents our most immediate product risk - without achieving human-level
output quality, users won't invest time iterating on generated emails, limiting adoption of this
core Copilot capability. The current prototype surpasses existing emailer performance but falls
short of best SDR output. Engineering handoff is proceeding, but we need parallel prompt
optimization and systematic quality measurement against curated examples to reach acceptable
standards.

Admin-defined territories faces resource contention as multiple engineering teams juggle
competing priorities. The Ringlead team's delay on user summary page development pushes
GA timeline while bulk upload testing encountered staging compatibility issues. Despite strong
beta customer feedback, the feature needs consolidated ownership and streamlined
development process to reach production readiness.

Cross-functional bottlenecks are emerging around design resources and GTM data model
integration. Adam's V2 onboarding work is constrained by designer availability just as multiple
teams swarm GTMC development. Simultaneously, David's priority accounts work depends on
resolving how new GTM data model interfaces with existing search infrastructure, requiring
alignment across Platform, Enterprise Search, and Apps teams.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries
The Intent Topic AI Recommendation launch validated our hypothesis that AI-driven setup can
dramatically improve user experience - recommendations were immediately available
post-launch rather than requiring manual configuration. However, the 30-60% relevancy rate
suggests significant room for improvement through better recommendation algorithms and user
feedback loops. This pattern should inform all future features requiring user setup.

UXR insights from Al Nevarez's advanced search interviews reveal a critical split in user
preferences: large enterprise customers demand filter facets for precise control and evidence of
search accuracy, while smaller customers prefer natural language interfaces. This suggests our
advanced search evolution needs hybrid approaches rather than wholesale replacement of
existing functionality. The popularity of chat-based search with persistent history indicates strong
user appetite for conversational interfaces.

Mobile feature development exposed severe limitations in our people location data quality,
forcing us to shelve a highly-requested mapping feature. This represents both a immediate
product gap and a broader data quality challenge that affects customer satisfaction across
multiple use cases. The $2M+ renewals driven by mobile export features demonstrate the
revenue impact of addressing field sales workflows effectively.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our collaboration with the Agentic platform team on emailer development is progressing
smoothly with clear handoff protocols established. Gabe's prototype serves as the foundation
while the email engineering team (X-Wing) continues development and enhancement. This
partnership model should be replicated for other agent development initiatives.

Design resource allocation requires strategic coordination as Katya works intensively on Ant's
profiles redesign while Sarah supports both Gabe's emailer designs and Al's advanced search
prototyping. The upcoming GTM Copilot launch will intensify design demands, suggesting need
for additional design capacity or more structured prioritization frameworks.

Looking Ahead

Next week's priorities center on quality validation and external launch preparation. The Intent
Topic AI Recommendation monitoring system goes live, providing our first comprehensive view
of AI feature adoption patterns and user behavior. These insights will guide both immediate
feature improvements and broader AI-first product development principles.

GTM Copilot rollout planning takes center stage with a phased approach targeting high-value
renewals while managing support burden. The $61M renewal pipeline through year-end
requires aggressive rollout timeline balanced against feature request volume and team capacity.
Success here establishes GTM Copilot as our primary growth driver and validates the unified
experience approach.
Product review preparation for agentic profiles represents a key strategic milestone, positioning
our vision for AI-powered account intelligence in front of executive leadership. Ant's work on
next best actions, informed by learnings from previous "recommended plays" attempts, could
differentiate us significantly if we nail the agentic framework approach. The combination of
quality profile information presentation and actionable recommendations positions us as the
market leader for actionable account intelligence.
