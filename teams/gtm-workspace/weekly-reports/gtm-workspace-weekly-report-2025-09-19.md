SalesOS/Copilot Executive Roundup -
[September 15th - September 18th, 2025]

Executive Summary

Copilot Workspace launched successfully to 100+ internal users with strong engagement and
valuable feedback identifying critical quality-of-life improvements needed for broader rollout. Ant
Cuomo has profiles engineering-ready for 10/6 MVP while mobile V2 prototype work
accelerates Q4 launch timeline. Multiple production launches completed including HubSpot
CRM prioritization affecting 400+ customers, with Forrester Wave competitive positioning
strengthened through comprehensive RFI responses.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

Adam Severance executed a successful Copilot Workspace internal launch to over 100 users,
generating extensive feedback that revealed both strong user engagement and specific usability
improvements needed for the next wave rollout. The feedback is driving immediate
optimizations in view manipulation, filter controls, and chat context accuracy that will strengthen
the foundation before expanding to 200+ additional users next week.

Harinath Krishnamoorthy delivered two major production feature launches - HubSpot CRM
package prioritization and Date Filter in AFS - impacting 400+ customers while completing
comprehensive Forrester Wave RFI responses that strengthen ZoomInfo's competitive
differentiation in the Revenue Marketing category. His Q4 2025-H1 2026 roadmap now includes
10 strategic initiatives spanning persona-based intent, new data sources, and multi-product
support.

Gabe Pirela advanced the email agent architecture to a sub-agent pattern on the agentic
platform, enabling more scalable and reliable bulk email capabilities while launching the internal
MEDDPIC extraction pilot with 25+ reps receiving automated post-call analysis via Slack.
Design work for the deal qualification assistant in Copilot Workspaces is progressing rapidly with
engineering validation confirmed.

Goals & Progress

Profiles & Mobile Development: Ant Cuomo has GTMC profiles designs finalized and
engineering dependencies resolved, ensuring 90% of planned features will be ready for the 10/6
MVP launch. Mobile V2 development gained momentum with two major agents (Pulse for daily
priorities and Discover for research insights) in active development, positioning the team ahead
of Q4 mobile expansion goals.

Email & Automation Systems: The email agent transition to sub-agent architecture unlocked
bulk email use cases while improving repeatability and token efficiency across all chat
interactions. MEDDPIC extraction automation is generating high-quality outputs for internal
validation, with parallel design streams preparing the Copilot Workspace integration for rapid
deployment once validation completes.

Infrastructure & Territory Management: David Goulden made progress on admin-defined
territories despite increasing complexity from enterprise customer requirements for Salesforce
integration and bulk upload capabilities. Zero admin setup discussions with Tingting's team are
clarifying domain ownership and establishing foundation for 5-day onboarding goals, though
significant alignment work remains.

Strategic Challenges

Priority accounts API fragmentation continues to create complexity across multiple teams, with
engineering dependencies on federated search capabilities still being resolved. David Goulden's
team needs standardization of the Priority Accounts API and clarity on GTM data model
integration to support enterprise CRM setups effectively. The current distributed approach
requires coordination across Platform, Enterprise Search, and multiple product teams.

Copilot Workspace feedback reveals fundamental usability issues in view manipulation and filter
controls that could impact broader rollout success if not addressed quickly. Adam Severance
identified chat hallucination problems, including incorrect ACV calculations that erode user trust,
requiring immediate attention to context accuracy and data validation before expanding the user
base beyond the current 100-person cohort.

Admin-defined territories faces increasing scope complexity as enterprise customers request
Salesforce territory import and bulk upload capabilities that extend beyond the original vision.
The integration requirements with CRM data models and ongoing maintenance challenges may
require architectural decisions about API approaches versus out-of-the-box solutions for
sustainable scaling.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

The sub-agent architecture implementation by Gabe Pirela's team revealed that the previous
monolithic agent approach was causing repeatability issues and excessive token usage. The
new coordinator pattern with specialized sub-agents shows early promise for both cost
efficiency and response quality, establishing a scalable foundation for future agent development
across all product areas.

Internal user feedback from Copilot Workspace launch demonstrated that quality-of-life features
matter more than advanced capabilities for driving adoption. Users prioritize reliable filter
manipulation, accurate data context, and smooth view transitions over complex AI features,
suggesting the product strategy should emphasize foundational user experience excellence
before adding sophisticated automation layers.

Enterprise territory management requirements prove significantly more complex than
anticipated, with customers using territories for both rule-based matching and CRM
segmentation. This discovery challenges the current approach and may require fundamental
architectural decisions about whether to extend the GTM data model early in its lifecycle or
develop more sophisticated integration patterns.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with the Agentic Platform team on sub-agent architecture continues to be critical for
email functionality and overall chat experience reliability. Lars and Ryan's team has confirmed
feasibility for bulk email use cases while implementing the coordinator pattern that will benefit all
future agent development across the platform.

Design team coordination with Megan Cartlidge becomes increasingly important as multiple
initiatives (profiles, mobile, MEDDPIC extraction, engagement widgets) require concurrent
design work. The team is managing competing priorities while maintaining quality standards
across initiatives targeting the 10/6 launch date.

Looking Ahead

Next week focuses on executive go/no-go decisions for expanding Copilot Workspace from 100
to 200+ users based on current feedback resolution and quality improvements. The team will
prioritize addressing chat context accuracy, view manipulation issues, and filter controls while
preparing persona-specific FTUE for the next wave rollout.

Engineering kickoffs for profiles will accelerate development toward 10/6 MVP delivery while
mobile V2 agent development continues with Pulse and Discover prototypes. MEDDPIC
extraction pilot feedback will inform rapid iteration cycles leading to Copilot Workspace
integration planning. Territory management decisions on Salesforce integration scope and zero
admin setup alignment will establish foundation for sustainable enterprise customer onboarding.

The successful internal launch momentum positions the team well for broader rollout while
current feedback provides clear optimization priorities that will strengthen the product foundation
before external customer exposure.
