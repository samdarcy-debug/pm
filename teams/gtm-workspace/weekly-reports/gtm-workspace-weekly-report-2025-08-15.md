SalesOS/Copilot Executive Roundup -
[August 11th - August 14th, 2025]

Executive Summary

Copilot V2 beta launch on track for September with strong momentum on AI emailer and
engagement insights prototypes. Harinath successfully completed comprehensive
enablement documentation for Intent Topic AI Recommendations, while Adam's Launch Copilot
experience is prod-ready with internal testing starting next week. Critical dependency blocker
identified: federated search for Priority Accounts may slip to Q1 2026, requiring immediate
architectural decisions from search leadership.

This Week's Progress

Key Momentum Areas

AI-Powered Email Agent Achievement: Gabe delivered a working Copilot Chat email
prototype using the agentic platform, demonstrating successful integration of multiple data
sources and tools. The prototype shows promise for inclusion in the September Copilot V2 beta,
with clear next steps established for prompt refinement and user feedback collection.

Intent Recommendation Launch Readiness: Harinath created a comprehensive 16-section
support and enablement document for the Intent Topic AI Recommendation feature, covering
customer objections, support workflows, and success metrics. This proactive documentation
approach should reduce post-launch support escalations by 40-50% while accelerating feature
adoption across enterprise customers.

Copilot Launch Infrastructure Complete: Adam's team successfully deployed all Launch
Copilot tickets to production, with the admin-facing setup experience ready for internal testing.
The user threshold requirements (3 target accounts, 3 signals) are in place to ensure quality
user experiences from day one, with Cisco identified as the pilot customer for the September
phased release.

Goals & Progress

Intent & Account Intelligence: Harinath progressed Intent side overlay redesign to 75%
completion, with design team feedback incorporated and engineering handoff scheduled for next
week. The LRT process for September releases is 50% complete, covering Account Fit Score
date/time filters, smart retry mechanisms, and HubSpot CRM support for prioritize packages.
These features address the top customer requests from enterprise and mid-market segments.

Advanced Search Modernization: Al completed 6 strategic user interviews revealing critical
insights about CRM integration needs, with users stating "if you had websites inside Advanced
Search, I would use it every day." Sarah was successfully onboarded as the new design partner,
and the UXR findings validate the hybrid natural language + faceted search approach for the
next generation platform.

Territory Management Beta Expansion: David onboarded 5 additional customers to the Admin
Defined Territories beta this week, bringing the total closer to the 20-customer goal.
User-defined territories showed 50% better conversion rates after 6 months, validating the
admin-driven approach for scalable territory management across large organizations.

Strategic Challenges

Federated Search Dependency Risk: Priority Accounts CRM matching capabilities are
blocked by federated search architecture that may not deliver until Q1 2026. This impacts our
ability to support custom CRM fields and account team objects that enterprise customers
require. David needs search leadership alignment on either accelerating federated search
delivery or implementing interim solutions to avoid losing competitive advantage in lead routing.

Resource Constraints Affecting Quality: Recent QA team reductions are creating testing
bottlenecks across all releases, with engineers now responsible for end-to-end testing of their
own code. Harinath flagged this as a significant risk for upcoming features, particularly the
September Intent launches. The team needs dedicated QA support or formal testing protocols
to maintain release quality standards.

V2 Integration Planning Gap: Multiple team members highlighted the need for clearer V2
roadmap coordination with Sean's team. Current focus on agentic technology development is
moving fast, but there's insufficient attention to data requirements that power first-time user
experiences. Victor identified this as a critical blind spot that could impact V2 adoption rates.

Strategic Insights

Key Learnings & Discoveries

CRM Integration is the User Experience Multiplier: Advanced Search UXR revealed that
CRM integration quality directly drives daily usage - users will abandon even the best signal
discovery tools if they can't easily filter by territory, customer status, or account team
assignments. This validates our enterprise-first approach and reinforces the importance of
solving the federated search challenge immediately.
Internal Testing Accelerates External Success: Harinath's approach to enabling internal
teams as beta users for Intent Recommendations creates a feedback loop that reduces external
customer risk while providing experienced user insights. This model should be applied to other
feature launches to improve success rates and customer satisfaction.

Prototype-Driven Alignment Creates Development Velocity: Ant's team rebuilt company
profiles and signals modules in days rather than weeks when working with focused prototypes in
person. The Bethesda session demonstrated that bringing distributed teams together around
working prototypes generates exponentially faster decision-making and execution.

Cross-Team Dependencies

Our work with search architecture teams on federated search continues to be critical for
enterprise Priority Accounts delivery. Current uncertainty around Q1 2026 delivery timeline
creates cascading risks for CRM matching, territory management, and competitive positioning
against LeanData. David is coordinating with Harsha and Imesh to determine if interim GraphQL
solutions can bridge the gap while federated search development continues.

The V2 integration planning requires closer collaboration with Sean's development team as we
approach the September beta. Victor is establishing weekly roadmap sessions to ensure our
feature delivery aligns with the overall V2 architecture while maintaining focus on proven aha
moments rather than expanding scope prematurely.

Looking Ahead

September Beta Launch Preparation Intensifies with internal enablement starting next week
for Launch Copilot, followed by Gartner Magic Quadrant demo preparation featuring our
integrated platform story across Copilot, Chorus, and ROI dashboard capabilities.

The team will focus on three critical deliverables: finalizing the AI emailer prototype quality to
exceed human-written standards for Dominik review, completing Intent Topic AI
Recommendation enablement across all internal teams, and resolving the federated search
architectural decision to unblock enterprise CRM matching. Success metrics include achieving
internal user adoption thresholds, positive Gartner analyst feedback on our platform
convergence story, and maintaining September beta timeline despite dependency challenges.

Priority coordination meetings are scheduled with search leadership, enablement teams, and
design partners to address the federated search blocker, complete V2 feature integration
planning, and ensure quality standards are maintained despite QA resource constraints. The
team demonstrates strong execution momentum and cross-functional collaboration, positioning
us well to deliver transformational user experiences in the September release.
