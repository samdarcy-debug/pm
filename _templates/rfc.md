# RFC: {Title}

## Summary

One paragraph explaining the proposal. Assume the reader has limited time—what's the core idea?

## Motivation

**Why are we doing this?**

What problem does this solve? What pain point are we addressing?

**Why now?**

What makes this the right time? What's the urgency or catalyst?

**Who benefits?**

Which users, teams, or stakeholders benefit from this change?

## Detailed Design

This is the meat of the proposal. Be specific and thorough. Include:

### Architecture

High-level architecture or system design. Diagrams are encouraged.

### Implementation Details

Key technical details, APIs, data models, etc. Be as specific as necessary for reviewers to evaluate feasibility.

### User Experience

How does this affect the user experience? What changes at the product level?

### Data & Privacy

Any implications for data handling, storage, or privacy?

## Alternatives Considered

What other approaches did you evaluate? For each:

### Alternative 1: {Name}

**Description**: What is this alternative?

**Pros**: What are the advantages?

**Cons**: What are the disadvantages?

**Why not this**: Why are we not choosing this option?

### Alternative 2: {Name}

(Repeat structure)
