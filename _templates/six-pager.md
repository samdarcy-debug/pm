<!--
ABOUT THIS TEMPLATE:
This is an Amazon-style six-pager narrative document. Six-pagers are designed to be read silently
at the beginning of a meeting, then discussed. They replace PowerPoint and force rigorous thinking
through complete, narrative writing.

WHY SIX PAGES?
- Forces you to think deeply and completely about your idea
- Eliminates the ambiguity of bullet points
- Levels the playing field (everyone reads, then discusses)
- Creates a permanent, referenceable artifact

HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:
1. Write in complete sentences and paragraphs, not bullets
2. Aim for ~2500 words (roughly 6 pages in a standard document)
3. Be specific, not abstract. Use data, examples, and concrete details.
4. Answer the "so what?" at every turn. Why does this matter?
5. Expect people to read this silently for 15-20 minutes before discussion

WRITING TIPS:
- Start with the customer/user, not the solution
- Be crisp and direct. Eliminate jargon.
- Use subheadings to guide the reader
- Front-load your key insights and recommendations
- Anticipate and address objections

## Introduction

**Purpose of this document:** In 2-3 sentences, state clearly what this document is about and what you're asking of the reader. Are you proposing something? Sharing a decision? Seeking input on a direction?

**Context:** What's the backdrop? What situation, problem, or opportunity prompted this document? Give just enough context so the reader understands why this matters now.

---

## Goals

**What are we trying to achieve?** State the goals clearly. These should be outcome-oriented, not activity-oriented.

*Example: "Increase enterprise customer retention from 85% to 92% by end of Q3 2025" rather than "Build better customer success tooling."*

**Success Metrics:** How will we know we've succeeded? Be specific about what we'll measure.

- **Metric 1:** [Specific, measurable outcome]
- **Metric 2:** [Specific, measurable outcome]
- **Metric 3:** [Specific, measurable outcome]

---

## Tenets / Principles

**What are the core beliefs or principles guiding this work?** Amazon calls these "tenets." They're the non-negotiables that inform your decisions. List 3-5 tenets that will guide this initiative.

*Example tenets:*
- *"We optimize for long-term customer value, not short-term revenue."*
- *"We ship iteratively and learn from real usage."*
- *"We build for scalability from day one, not as an afterthought."*

1. **Tenet 1:** [Statement of principle and why it matters]

2. **Tenet 2:** [Statement of principle and why it matters]

3. **Tenet 3:** [Statement of principle and why it matters]

## Current State / Background

**Where are we today?** Describe the current state in detail. What's working? What's not? What data do we have?

This section should be **factual and objective**. Use data, customer quotes, metrics, and concrete examples. Help the reader understand the landscape before you propose a solution.

### What We Know

[Describe what you know with certainty. Include data, research findings, customer feedback.]

### What We Don't Know

[Be honest about gaps in knowledge or areas of uncertainty. This builds credibility.]

### Why This Matters Now

[Why is this the right time to address this? What's the urgency or opportunity?]

---

## Proposal / Recommendation

**What are you proposing?** This is the heart of the document. Be specific and comprehensive. Don't just say what you want to do—explain *how* and *why*.

### The Core Idea

[Describe your proposal in narrative form. What are you recommending? What will actually happen? Paint a picture.]

### How It Works

[Explain the mechanics. If you're proposing a new feature, how does it work from the user's perspective? If it's a process change, walk through the new process step by step.]

### Why This Approach

[Defend your recommendation. Why is this the right approach? What makes this better than alternatives? Use data, precedent, or logical reasoning to build your case.]

### Customer / User Experience

[How does this affect the customer or end user? Tell the story from their perspective. What changes for them? Why is their experience better?]

*Tip: Write a "press release" style paragraph imagining you're announcing this to customers. What would you say?*

---

## Alternatives Considered

**What else did you evaluate?** Being thorough about alternatives shows you've done the work and builds trust. For each alternative, explain what it is, why you considered it, and why you're not recommending it.

### Alternative 1: [Name]

**Description:** [What is this alternative?]

**Pros:** [What are the advantages?]

**Cons:** [What are the downsides?]

**Why not this:** [Why are you not recommending this option?]

### Alternative 2: [Name]

[Repeat the structure]

### Alternative 3: [Name]

[Repeat the structure]

### Do Nothing / Status Quo

**Why not do nothing?** Explicitly address the "do nothing" option. What's the cost of inaction?

---

## Dependencies & Risks

**What needs to be true for this to succeed?** Be explicit about dependencies on other teams, systems, or initiatives. What could go wrong?

### Dependencies

- **Dependency 1:** [What depends on what? Who owns it?]
- **Dependency 2:** [What depends on what? Who owns it?]

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact (H/M/L) | Likelihood (H/M/L) | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| [Describe the risk] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How will we address or monitor this?] |
| [Describe the risk] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How will we address or monitor this?] |
| [Describe the risk] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How will we address or monitor this?] |

## Resources & Investment

**What will this cost?** Be realistic about the resources required. Include engineering time, design time, operational costs, opportunity costs, etc.

**Team / Headcount:**
- [Team or person] - [Estimated time or % allocation]
- [Team or person] - [Estimated time or % allocation]

**Budget / External Costs:**
- [Any external costs, vendor fees, infrastructure costs]

**Opportunity Cost:**
- [What are we *not* doing if we pursue this?]
