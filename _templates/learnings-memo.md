**[Metric Name]:** Brief description of metric movement and your contribution.

**[Metric Name]:** Brief description of metric movement and your contribution.

## Key Learnings

> What non-obvious insights did you discover this quarter that other teams should know?

**[Learning Title]:** Detailed explanation of what you learned and why it matters. Focus on insights that weren't obvious at the start—the things you only know after doing the work.

**[Learning Title]:** Another key learning with context and implications.

**[Learning Title]:** Continue with 3-5 major learnings.

## Hypotheses & Results

> What assumptions did you test this quarter, and what did you learn from the results?

**H1: [Hypothesis statement]**
**[Validated/Partially Validated/Invalidated].** Explanation of what you tested, what you found, and what it means going forward. Include specific data or customer feedback that informed the conclusion.

**H2: [Hypothesis statement]**
**[Validated/Partially Validated/Invalidated].** Explanation of results.

**H3: [Hypothesis statement]**

## Go-forward Changes & Plan

> Based on your learnings, what strategic shifts are you making? What are you doubling down on or stopping?

**Critical Blockers:** What must be resolved to make progress? What dependencies exist?

**Scale What Works:** What validated approaches are you expanding or accelerating?

**Strategic Pivots:** What direction changes are you making based on learnings? What are you stopping or deprioritizing?

**Q{Next} Priorities:** High-level focus areas for next quarter based on this quarter's insights.

## Leveraging AI

> How did you use AI this quarter? What infrastructure or process insights did you gain?

**Q{N} Implementations:** Specific AI tools, prototypes, or features you built or used.

## Tips for Writing Effective Learning Memos

1. **Focus on non-obvious insights**: Don't document what everyone already knows. Share what you learned by doing the work that others couldn't know without experiencing it themselves.

2. **Be specific with evidence**: Back up learnings with customer quotes, data, or concrete examples. "Customers want faster load times" is obvious. "Users abandon features when load time exceeds 2 seconds, as shown by Dylan's workspace testing" is a learning.

3. **Write for future PMs**: Imagine a new PM joining your team next quarter. What would you want them to know that isn't in PRDs or docs?

4. **Connect learnings across teams**: Reference related insights from other team's memos. Cross-team patterns are often the most valuable.

5. **Include failures**: Invalidated hypotheses and failed approaches are often more valuable than successes. They prevent others from making the same mistakes.

6. **Quantify impact where possible**: Metrics, customer counts, revenue impact, time saved—numbers make learnings concrete and actionable.

7. **Link to people and docs**: Use wiki-links to reference teammates, related PRDs, RFCs, and other learnings memos.
