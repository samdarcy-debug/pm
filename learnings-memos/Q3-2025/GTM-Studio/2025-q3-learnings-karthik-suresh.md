## **Metric Alignment**



As the new PM leader for GTM Studio Plays (joined September 2nd), I\'m

yet to establish north-star metrics but these are the metrics I\'m

considering:



**Current Focus Metrics:**



- Activation Campaigns Run per GTM Studio User



- AI Credits Consumption per GTM Studio User



- Workbook-to-Workflow Conversion



These ladder to Platform Revenue by driving usage-based expansion.



## **Key Learnings**



1.  In my first two months, the revelation was that AI-native apps are

    still brand new and need to win trust from both internal teams and

    external customers - everyone\'s excited but skeptical.



2.  The \"activation gap\" between GTM Studio insights and actual

    campaign execution is massive - teams build beautiful audiences but

    struggle to operationalize them.



3.  There is a ton of potential across various ZoomInfo apps to

    integrate Agentic workflows and supercharge the products.



## **Hypotheses & Results**



**Hypothesis 1: \"The DoubleO acquisition/rebrand would create

opportunity for innovation\"**



- **Result**: TRUE. While there\'s healthy debate around terminology

  (Agents vs. Workflows vs. Actions vs. Chatbots), this has sparked

  valuable conversations about what automation truly means for GTM use

  cases. Customer enthusiasm is through the roof - they\'re eager to

  adopt.



- **Learning**: Customer excitement validates the vision - focus on

  shipping value quickly



**Hypothesis 2: \"Quick wins would come from existing Plays

customers\"**



- **Result**: TRUE. Potential customers are eager to start using Plays



- **Learning**: Quickly build and deploy top 5 use cases as workflows

  and test.



**Hypothesis 3: \"Large company integration would be challenging\"**



- **Result**: FALSE. ZoomInfo moves incredibly fast - full integration

  roadmap approved in 3 weeks



- **Learning**: The company\'s agility is a superpower. We can outpace

  competitors by shipping integrated experiences they can\'t match



## 



## **Go-forward Changes & Plan**



**Q4 2025 Priorities (First Full Quarter):**



1.  **Trust Building**: Ship 5 \"hero workflows\" with guaranteed ROI

    metrics to build confidence in AI-native approach



2.  **Unified Experience**: Embed Plays directly in GTM Studio UI



3.  **Integration Infrastructure**: Build robust connectivity to

    Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, Salesloft and other apps for seamless

    workflow execution



4.  **Sales & CS Enablement**: Develop comprehensive training program

    ensuring every customer-facing team member can demo and position

    Plays effectively



## **Leveraging AI**



**Most Impactful Use Case**: **DoubleO.ai for Rapid Workflow

Prototyping**



DoubleO.ai is an AI automation platform (which was recently acquired by

ZoomInfo) that allows non-technical users to build complex workflows by

simply describing what they want in natural language. The platform

creates teams of specialized AI agents that can handle different parts

of a task one might gather data from the web, another might draft

content or update spreadsheets, and another might send communications.



I\'m currently using DoubleO.ai to automate a lot of my own personal

workflows including daily call prep, writing PRDs, and creating research

reports.



**Q4 AI Expansion:**



- **Native Integration**: Embed DoubleO AI directly inside GTM Studio,

  allowing users to build workflows using natural language without

  leaving the platform



- **Platform-Wide Framework**: Deploy the DoubleO framework as a shared

  service across all ZoomInfo products.



- **Developer Platform**: Open the DoubleO framework to partners and

  customers for building custom AI-powered integrations



The strategic vision: Transform DoubleO from a standalone product into

ZoomInfo\'s core AI orchestration layer - every team should be able to

automate workflows using natural language, regardless of which ZoomInfo

product they\'re using. This positions us to own the entire GTM AI

automation category.
