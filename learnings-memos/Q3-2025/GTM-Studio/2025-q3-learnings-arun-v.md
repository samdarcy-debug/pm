**Q3 '25 LEARNINGS MEMO\

Product Area:** CFA \| **Domain focus:** ROI & Usage Analytics \|

**PM:** Arun v



#### **Metric Alignment**



**Integrations (Driver)** -- Achieve a 50% conversion rate of customers

who visit the dashboard without a connected CRM, driving them to

integrate after viewing ROI impact.



**More consumptions (North Star)** -- Number of accounts recommended per

record under management. Achieve 5% consumption. (Total Recommended

Accounts / Total Records Under Management)\

\

**Net Retention Rate (Business North Star)** -- Since CFA cross-cuts

multiple products and highlights the ROI of ZoomInfo offerings, NRR is a

key metric we track. We aim for 90% of tenants to renew after engaging

with the dashboard.



#### **Key Learnings**



Derived from insights across 50+ accounts via internal reviews with AMs

and CSMs, 30+ customer calls, and beta enablement of the ROI Dashboard:



**Magic Number**: Customers trust 20--35% pipeline influence as

credible. Showing higher numbers triggers skepticism, so it's important

to offer ways to provide more reliable correlation.



**New Business \> Renewal**: Enterprise+ customers care more about

influence on new business than on renewals. While renewals account for

70% of enterprise revenue, our GTM teams often struggle to demonstrate

impact there. Showing influence on new deals resonates as most credible

with customers.



**Strong Market Validation**: 80% of beta customers rated ROI Analytics

as valuable, and 95% of AMs/CSMs reported higher renewal confidence

[^[\*1]{.underline}^](#this-is-qualitative-data-derived-from-analyzing-transcripts-of-customer-and-aecsm-calls-recorded-in-chorus-with-summarized-insights-shared-as-part-of-the-beta-program-report.).

The beta covered \$45M+ in ACV across 50+ accounts. Unlike push products

that need heavy enablement to drive adoption, ROI Analytics was a **pull

product,** customers and AM/CSMs actively sought it out to prove ROI.



**Different cohorts, different needs:** Enterprise and Strategic

customers expected deeper validation, asking for exportable

opportunity-interaction correlation data and multi-currency support so

their analysts could verify the ROI claims. In contrast, Mid-Market

customers were less focused on granular proof and found value in a ROI

memo that helped them communicate the story to their leadership teams.



**Attribution:** About 2--5% of customers remain unconvinced by

correlation alone and require attribution to accurately map ROI. For

now, the data is shared with them through exports.



**Key Gaps to Address:\**



- CRM configuration complexity delays activation.



- Customers want to confirm if emails/calls were made to

  ZoomInfo-researched contacts. Need Email/Call engagement data for

  accurate correlation.



- Only \~600 of 15K CRM-connected customers have proper team hierarchy

  data. Need SCIM hierarchy for better hierarchy-level reporting.



###### ^\*1^ This is qualitative data derived from analyzing transcripts of customer and AE/CSM calls recorded in Chorus, with summarized insights shared as part of the [[Beta program report]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1bEC6tdYPRlxNlYfxM8uOXw7mQJHSOw45IdBcQyqR1_U/edit).



###### 



#### **Hypotheses & Results**



1.  **Hypothesis:** If customers are given more control over defining

    what counts as "influence" (filters by interaction type, opportunity

    type, engagement type, and activity thresholds), they will find the

    ROI metrics more credible and aligned with their definition of

    value.\

    **Result:** Customers validated this by consistently asking for

    filters and the ability to highlight wins tied to specific

    interactions. Before adding these controls, 40% of calls included

    pushback on ROI credibility; with filters, this concern nearly

    disappeared.



2.  **Hypothesis:** Embedding Self-Serve analytics agent in the

    user/team productivity section will allow customers and AMs/CSMs

    eliminate the need to build multiple separate widgets.\

    **Early Result:** Still in testing, but initial use cases show high

    demand for understanding Copilot trial user performance over the

    last 30--60 days, tracking usage trends over time, comparing Team A

    vs. Team B, and identifying active/inactive users based on custom

    definitions (beyond simple logins). This reduces reliance on

    multiple dashboards and widgets, and improves their ability to take

    action based on usage insights.



#### **Go-forward Changes & Plan**



*Outlook: Based on your learnings & insights, what will you prioritize

next quarter?*



1.  **Beyond Renewals**



> ROI Analytics product has shown strong early results in driving

> customer renewals. Now, we want to take the next step, turn it into a

> growth driver that delivers more value to customers and increases

> credit consumption. Note: ROI Analytics is already part of regular

> customer review meetings - weekly, biweekly, monthly, and quarterly.\

> \

> **Hypothesis:** If we add biweekly account recommendations directly in

> the platform, and let customers or AMs/CSMs share quick feedback on

> what worked and what didn't in the review meetings, we can create a

> feedback loop that makes recommendations smarter over time and drives

> better results.\

> \

> **Idea:** We're not building another scoring model. Instead, we'll use

> existing data like AFS, Intent Topics, IMS, along with context and

> offering information from the GTM Studio portal. This will help us

> recommend the right accounts that can grow pipeline and activate

> high-value signals to speed up deals already in progress.



2.  **Workbook and Workspace Analytics ROI**



> Extend the current dashboard to capture usage and ROI across the full

> workflow, from Workbook to Workspace.



3.  **Team Insights:** The "Usage Insights" dashboard, which includes

    logins, recent activity, and credit consumption data, will be

    consolidated under the User/Team Productivity section.



#### **Leveraging AI**



**Self Serve Analytics Agent:** Chat Agent that enables customers and

internal teams to instantly receive interactive charts and visual

insights on product usage.

calculated, trace their data sources, and provides step-by-step guidance

when there are issues with CRM connections or discrepancies in numbers.\
