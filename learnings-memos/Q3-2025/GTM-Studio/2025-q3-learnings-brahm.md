# **Q3 2025 Learning Memo**



**Product Area:** GTM Studio \| **Domain Focus:** Data Management, ROI

Analytics, GTM Config\

**PM:** Brahm Kohli \| **Quarter:** Q3 2025



## **From Analytics to AI-Assisted Operations**



My scope expanded this quarter from ROI Analytics to the broader RevOps

operational stack: data management, GTM configuration, and ROI

intelligence. This shift reflects fundamental learnings on how we serve

the operator persona through AI-assisted capabilities that proactively

manage data quality, simplify complex configurations, and surface

actionable intelligence. The strategic imperative: transform ZoomInfo

from a data provider into the operational foundation that powers revenue

execution, where clean data, intelligent insights, and simplified

workflows compound to drive measurable pipeline impact and customer

retention.



## **Key Learnings**



**1. ROI visibility converts directly to revenue retention and

expansion.** Q3 validated that demonstrating quantifiable business

impact drives measurable outcomes. Indeed expanded from \$1M to \$1.66M

ACV (first multi-year \~\$5M TCV deal) after engaging with ROI,

explicitly citing it as decisive. Zendesk, which churned in July,

returned within 60 days at \~\$120K ACV after receiving an ROI memo.

Analysis of 340+ customers engaged with ROI shows 86% renewal win rates

versus 79% for non-engaged accounts, translating to \$7.7M in renewals.

Opportunity cost remains substantial: \$31.8M in lost ACV from

non-engaged accounts despite active CRM integrations, indicating need

for broader enablement as we get closer to GA.



**2. Data management represents significant trapped value opportunity.**

Our \$125M+ ACV business (20% YoY growth, 106% net retention, probably

second best performing product after DaaS) operates at structural

capacity constraints: 3-6 month implementation timelines, manual

pre-sales assessments consuming scarce solution consulting capacity, and

roadmap clarity gaps escalating to enterprise renewal threats (Paychex,

Workday demanding product investment transparency). Meanwhile, \~12K

existing ZoomInfo customers with active CRM integrations represent

whitespace. Systematic revenue expansion is blocked by operational

complexity rather than product-market fit. The strategic question isn\'t

whether customers need data management (100s of manual pre-sales

assessments quarterly prove demand), but whether we can deliver at scale

through AI-assisted simplification.



**3. Enterprise and Strategic customers demonstrate strong analytics

adoption; Mid-Market and SMB segments might require different enablement

models.** ROI adoption analysis shows clear segmentation patterns:

Enterprise/Strategic accounts generating \$4.92M across 37 Copilot

customers with high engagement rates, while Mid-Market represents 36% of

total ACV losses despite CRM integration availability. This suggests

opportunity to expand adoption in Mid-Market and SMB through

lighter-touch, more automated value delivery given organizational

capacity constraints on the customer side.



**4. Configuration complexity, not missing features, drives adoption

failure.** GTM Config discovery revealed customers struggle not because

capabilities are absent, but because current approaches force premature

structuring before customers understand their GTM strategy. Admins spend

weeks to months on manual setup lacking visibility into how

configurations generate \~30 recommended signals, creating perception of

a black box. This drives distrust and abandonment. The path forward:

enable customers with zero-config starting points, describe their GTM

context conversationally through AI.



## **Hypotheses & Results**



### **Data Management: AI-Assisted Simplification Unlocks TAM Capture**



**Hypothesis:** Can we scale data management adoption by addressing the

implementation bottleneck through AI-assisted onboarding, reducing

timelines from 3-6 months to 2 weeks?



**Method:** Designed crawl-walk-run roadmap: retention enhancements,

self-service data foundation management (mid Q1), AI-assisted onboarding

(mid Q2). Built Data Health Scan prototypes targeting \~4K

Enterprise/Strategic/Mid-Market accounts.



**Result:** Strategic direction validated with Sales/CX leadership. Data

Health Scan prototypes built for 1,200+ accounts with GTM partnership

across 25+ AMs driving Q4 upsell motion. Technical delivery team

validated as unable to scale to 12K+ whitespace with existing product;

proven product-market fit (\$125M+ ACV, 106% retention, 20% YoY growth)

trapped behind implementation friction. AI-assisted approach plus

simplified design required to unlock.



**Decision:** Build data management within Studio while maintaining

tactical RingLead improvements. Prioritize conversational configuration,

intelligent troubleshooting, and proactive data health monitoring to

eliminate support and implementation overhead by 90%.

### **ROI Analytics: From Beta to Revenue Driver**



**Hypothesis:** If customers see quantifiable ROI correlation between

platform usage and pipeline/team productivity outcomes, it drives

renewal confidence and expansion conversations.



**Method:** Expanded beta from 5-10 customers to 150+ CSM/AMs across

100+ accounts. Addressed data health issues through GTM Data Store

migration achieving 99% data match across 20+ staging accounts.



**Result:** Strong validation. Beyond Indeed and Zendesk wins: 86%

renewal win rates for engaged versus 79% non-engaged. 341 unique

viewers. \$31.8M lost ACV from non-engaged accounts indicates

opportunity as we approach GA in Q4.



**Decision:** Accelerate Q4 GA following GTM Data Store migration.

Expand from Copilot V1 + ZIS to include Copilot V2, Workbooks, and Data

Management interactions to tell end to end GIP platform ROI story.



### **GTM Config: Ownership Clarity Enables Rapid Prototyping**



**Hypothesis:** Clear separation between GTM Config (user-facing agent)

and Intelligence team (context data product) accelerates velocity and

reduces friction.



**Method:** Established ownership: GTM Config owns Config Agent,

Intelligence owns Context Service. Prioritized Config for Context over

Admin onboarding. Leveraged v0 for rapid prototyping.



**Result:** Enabled alignment and iteration. Validated offering-centric

architecture with AI-generated 0-config defaults and conversational

interface. Testing approach established. Config Agent roadmap defined

for end-November.



**Decision:** Proceed with offering-centric prototyping. Defer Admin

onboarding until Context foundation proves successful.



## **Go-Forward Changes & Plan**



**Data Management (Q4 2025 to Q1 2026):**



1.  **Revenue Acceleration:** Execute Data Health Scan GTM motion with

    AMs/CSMs targeting \~4K Enterprise/Strategic/Mid-Market accounts.

    Enrich Premium+ expansion to HubSpot/Dynamics) protecting \$28M+ Q4

    renewals.



2.  **MVP Foundation (Q4 to Q1):** Complete planning and development for

    Data Foundation Management (dedupe, normalize, segment) within GTM

    Studio, delivering table-stakes functionality forming core of

    sellable product.



3.  **AI-Assisted Onboarding (H1 2026):** Design conversational

    configuration and intelligent troubleshooting targeting 2-week

    implementation versus current 3-6 months. Build recommendations from

    RingLead usage patterns.



**ROI Analytics (Q4 2025):**



1.  **GA Readiness:** Complete GTM Data Store migration.



2.  **Platform Expansion:** Extend from Copilot-only to Workbooks,

    Copilot V2, and Data Management providing comprehensive GTM value

    story.



**GTM Config (Q4 2025):**



1.  **Config Agent MVP:** Deliver end-November release with

    conversational interface, 0-config defaults, and offering-centric

    experience enabling natural language context validation.



2.  **Early Validation:** Execute prototype testing validating Config

    for Context reduces complexity and improves signal relevance.



## **Leveraging AI**



**ROI Memo Generation & Natural Language Analytics:** AI-powered

narrative insights proved effective for executive communication,

directly contributing to Zendesk win-back and Indeed expansion. This

validates AI excels at translating complex analytical data into

compelling business narratives for C-level stakeholders lacking time for

product exploration. Additionally, Self-Serve Analytics Agent and ROI

FAQ Agent demos generated strong demand. Everyone shown these

capabilities awaits launch for natural language exploration of

analytical data.



**Expanding AI Usage:**



- **Conversational Data Management & Config:** Natural language

  interfaces translating business requirements into technical rules,

  eliminating weeks of manual setup



- **Intelligent Data Management Troubleshooting:** Context-aware

  guidance explaining errors and suggesting fixes, reducing support

  dependency



- **Pattern Recognition:** Recommendations from RingLead usage analysis

  accelerating implementation through proven configurations



## **Data Flywheel Contribution**



Q3 advances both contributory network enhancement (ROI measurement

driving CRM+Opportunity data sync, 400+ accounts connected their CRM

after engaging with Copilot Potential dashboard, more expected with ROI

launch) and behavioral context capture (every analytics interaction,

data management decision, and configuration choice generates signals

about customer priorities and successful patterns). Data management

creates our most defensible feedback loop: cleaner customer data drives

superior play outcomes, generating behavioral insights, improving AI

recommendations, increasing platform stickiness and driving further

adoption. This compound advantage strengthens our GTM Intelligence

platform moat against competitors focusing solely on workflow

orchestration without addressing foundational data quality.
