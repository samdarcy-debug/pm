#### **Metric Alignment**



Our work on the GTM Intelligence Platform directly supports the north

star metric of driving credit consumption. The primary mechanism for

this is the automated attribute generation via the AI Data Agent in GTM

Studio, which enables operators to create insights at scale across their

TAM. Early access customers are already demonstrating significant usage,

with one sales play alone processing AI insights for over 100,000

records.



Core use cases driving this consumption include web research for account

prioritization and crafting personalized outreach. For instance,

SurveyMonkey leveraged the AI Data Agent to identify best-fit accounts

for a new product launch from a list of 100,000 prospects, and Compass

Group automated the previously manual task of researching corporate

websites to identify key amenities for their catering services. This

tangible value is resonating, with customers like QuickBase noting [[how

much easier the data

in Studio is compared to competitors like Clay.\

\

**Key Learnings**



The GTM Studio early access program has validated strong product-market

fit, evidenced by a 59% high-tier conversion likelihood among 46

enterprise participants. However, realizing this potential requires us

to address critical adoption hurdles. While we\'ve effectively solved

for net-new business identification, the lack of seamless activation

capabilities prevents customers from realizing the end-to-end value of

the platform.\

\

Customers are also experiencing \"Tool Overload,\" ([[Brex explaining

the

struggle]{.underline}](https://hello.chorus.ai/listen?guid=f1f2511e8df74a88aa0c52375ccc4fab))

and we\'re not just competing with other products, but for the focus and

mindshare of our users. To cut through the noise, we must deliver

undeniable value.\

\

Our moat is the ecosystem play---leveraging Chorus's Conversation

Intelligence data to solve complex challenges like churn prevention is a

key differentiator that competitors who lack foundational data cannot

match. Paychex and Quickbase have shown immense interest here. Our path

to winning the mid-market and enterprise segments is to be the platform

that consolidates their tech stack.



> **Critical Implementation Barriers**



1.  **Administrative Access Requirements:** The requirement for

    admin-level Salesforce permissions is a significant blocker, causing

    implementation delays for 23% of customers, particularly those with

    locked-down IT environments like Figma. *"I don't want all my users

    to be able to push from Studio to Salesforce". "Some of my GTM

    Studio users don't have Admin access, how do we get them into the

    product?"*



2.  **Product Maturity Concerns:** 18% of customers are hesitant to

    invest fully in an early-stage product. "Studio is clearly in it's

    early stages. We want to wait & see".



3.  **ROI Attribution Gaps:** A significant 34% of customers are

    requesting better frameworks to measure business impact. Michael

    Dooley from ClassPass articulated this need clearly: \"We want to

    know whether this came from this tool in some form of fashion\".

    Similar feedback came from Ben Perceval, Spekit.



#### **Value Proposition Resonance & Clay Comparison**



> Our core value propositions are resonating strongly, which serves as a

> powerful validation of our strategy.



- **Data Unification:** This is the strongest predictor of conversion

  success. Customers feel the \"death by 1,000 cuts\" problem from tool

  switching, and our ability to consolidate platforms is a primary value

  driver.



- **AI-Powered Automation:** The ability to transform manual account

  planning into automated, strategic plays is especially compelling for

  technology companies.



- **Self-Service Data Operations:** Eliminating dependency on IT and

  data science teams strongly appeals to our target RevOps persona,

  reducing project timelines from weeks to days.



- **Enterprise-Ready Alternative to Clay:** 34% of customers are

  actively comparing us to Clay. We are successfully positioning GTM

  Studio as the enterprise-ready choice, differentiated by our superior

  credit efficiency, native ZoomInfo ecosystem integration, and

  white-glove support model



#### **Hypotheses & Results**



Based on these learnings, the success of GTM Studio hinges on

prioritizing the following initiatives:



1.  **It's easy to onboard into Studio:** This is the most critical

    immediate action. We must reduce the dependency on admin-level

    permissions to unlock the 23% of implementations currently delayed.

    As Julie Hannan at Figma noted, \"Not everyone gets Salesforce admin

    access\... there needs to be that middle zone\".



2.  **Just CRM Exports are not enough:** We have a major gap in our

    offering. The next step is to activate the insights generated in

    Studio for front-line sellers through Copilot workspaces and build

    automated plays via DoubleO. This keeps customers within our

    ecosystem and closes the loop on the end-to-end use case.



3.  **Customers will see ROI from Studio:** To justify investment and

    drive expansion, we must deliver on the need for a measurable

    business impact framework. This is a requirement for 34% of

    customers and is essential for moving them from beta to paid

    contracts.



4.  **Our product is easy to use:** We will continue to invest in our AI

    differentiation. A key priority is expanding natural language query

    capabilities to reduce onboarding friction and make it easier for

    users to leverage our data without extensive training



#### **Go-forward Changes & Plan**



Based on these learnings, the success of GTM Studio hinges on

prioritizing the following initiatives:



1.  **Role-Based Access Controls:** This is the most critical immediate

    action. We must reduce the dependency on admin-level permissions to

    unlock the 23% of implementations currently delayed. As Julie Hannan

    at Figma noted, \"Not everyone gets Salesforce admin access\...

    there needs to be that middle zone\".



2.  **Activation:** We have a major gap in our offering. The next step

    is to activate the insights generated in Studio for front-line

    sellers through Copilot workspaces and build automated plays via

    DoubleO. This keeps customers within our ecosystem and closes the

    loop on the end-to-end use case.

    expansion, we must deliver on the need for a measurable business

    impact framework. This is a requirement for 34% of customers and is

    essential for moving them from beta to paid contracts.



4.  **Advanced AI Capabilities:** We will continue to invest in our AI

    differentiation. A key priority is expanding natural language query

    capabilities to reduce onboarding friction and make it easier for

    users to leverage our data without extensive training.



#### **Leveraging AI**



This quarter, my most impactful use of AI was synthesizing unstructured

customer feedback from dozens of Chorus calls and reports into the

strategic insights that form this memo. Moving forward, I will expand my

use of AI to accelerate the product lifecycle by:



- Automating the creation of PRDs and launching enablement content.



- Using Studio Chat to analyze customer sentiment at scale within

  Workbooks.



- Systematically analyzing user research interviews to reduce synthesis

  time by 60-70%, enabling faster iteration on product requirements
