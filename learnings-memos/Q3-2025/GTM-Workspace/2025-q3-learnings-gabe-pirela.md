#### **Metric Alignment**



*Which north star and/or sub-driver metric(s) has your work contributed

to and how? You may describe other metrics that are primarily impacted

by your work that are not North star or North star sub-driver metrics,

but **you must specify how those ladder up to a North star or North star

sub-driver metric.** You can reference the [[Product Report

spreadsheet]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JtTCw0Wkxj2WAW0VxHz4rcpf2G0sienPvMnHUxHRolM/edit?gid=1313716005#gid=1313716005)

to see the full list of North star metrics and North star sub-metrics.*



**Active Integrations** - Introduced new CI integrations to Copilot

(Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, Salesloft, Clari) to drive consumption of

engagement data and strengthen our GTM intelligence foundation.



**Converting Actions per User per Month** - Introduced conversation

intelligence capabilities that drive use of Copilot AI feature set.

Users can now review calls, query meeting transcripts and get AI-powered

insights about their accounts, increasing engagement and product

stickiness.



#### **Key Learnings**



*In 10 sentences or fewer: "What does everyone in the product

organization need to know that you learned about our customers, users,

or products this quarter?"*



**Customers want intelligence, not just data access:** We\'ve seen a

significant increase in requests for Chorus data share access. Many

customers are attempting to build their own version of ZI chatbot to

query meeting transcripts and extract insights. This signals strong

demand for conversational AI that answers account-level and

opportunity-level questions, not just call playback.



**Enormous manual overhead remains in post-meeting workflows:** The

typical pattern looks like this: download transcript, upload to ChatGPT,

extract MEDDIC/BANT elements, manually populate CRM fields, document

competitors, and capture next steps. This extends beyond deal

qualification. Managers spend hours scoring calls and coaching reps one

by one. These activities desperately need automation at scale.



The market is fragmenting with niche providers solving these problems in

silos. This creates a clear consolidation opportunity for ZoomInfo.



**Our platform story is strong, but our packaging creates friction with

existing Chorus customers:** When we position Copilot and Chorus

together, we stand toe to toe with anyone. The challenge is that Chorus

customers rarely have one-to-one license parity with Copilot. Their

feature requests typically align with capabilities already available in

Copilot. At renewal, they see a lack of innovation in Chorus because our

investments are going into Copilot. From their perspective, accessing

the features they need requires paying for another product.



This creates a strategic bottleneck. We want to converge the platforms.

We\'re investing in Copilot to build our long-term GTM intelligence

vision. But Chorus customers at risk of churn cite these gaps as reasons

for evaluating competitors. The crux is solving access and packaging. If

we can give Chorus customers a path to the full suite of features, we

free ourselves to focus on building the strategic future in Copilot

rather than maintaining two platforms.



#### **Hypotheses & Results**



*Walk through 3-5 hypotheses you had going into the quarter and the

learnings for each. Be specific & nuanced.*



- **Experiment with integrated deal management and coaching insights**



  - Hypothesis: Creating insights/ agents that combine deal

    qualification methodologies (like MEDDIC) with coaching will provide

    more value than separate solutions and drive adoption.



  - Learnings: The two do go together, but in sequence. Strong customer

    interest validated demand for automated MEDDIC writeback to CRM as

    the starting point. Once the writeback is in place, tracking

    adherence and performance coaching naturally follows. The learning

    is that we can\'t deliver coaching insights without first automating

    the data capture. We need to prioritize adherence tracking and

    performance features after completing the writeback capability to

    deliver the full integrated value.



- **Partner with CFA on how to connect rep performance to business

  outcomes**



  - Hypothesis: Comparing rep behaviors to actual deal outcomes creates

    more valuable coaching insights than generic best practices.



  - Learnings: This work was deprioritized in partnership with CFA due

    to competing priorities. While theoretically compelling,

    outcome-based coaching requires data infrastructure that we don\'t

    yet have in place.



#### **Go-forward Changes & Plan**



*Outlook: Based on your learnings & insights, what will you prioritize

next quarter?*



**Accelerate Copilot Workspace and Chorus convergence.** The workspace

interface better aligns with typical Chorus personas/ use cases. This

gives us a clear convergence path while we partner with GTM to solve

existing customer packaging friction.



**Prioritize trend analysis as a must-have capability.** Lack of trend

analysis puts customers at risk. We can deliver this in a differentiated

way by pairing it with our core dataset. This enables the outcome-based

coaching and strategic insights customers are requesting.



**Build agents for automated bulk use cases.** Managers spend hours

scoring calls and coaching reps one by one. We need agents that automate

scorecards and coaching at scale. This addresses the manual overhead and

sets up adherence tracking that follows MEDDIC writeback.



#### **Leveraging AI**



*What is the most impactful tool / prompt / usecase you used AI for to

build better products? (use links/demos where you can)*



**Rapid prototyping with Cline and the ZI agentic platform repo.** I

used Cline and our agentic platform repo extensively to build my own

agents and validate ideas. This let me test conversation intelligence

workflows and agent interactions before committing engineering

resources. It compressed validation cycles from weeks to days.



Oldie but a goodie:\

\

**Claude Projects as a strategic thinking partner.** I built a Claude

project with all my strategic memos, roadmap documents, and key

artifacts. I updated my system prompt that defines how I present

information and what frameworks I use. I use this daily to test ideas,

draft memos, and refine strategic positions. It maintains consistency

across documents and accelerates writing cycles.



*How will you expand your use of AI in the coming quarter?*



**Expanding use next quarter:** I want to spend more time experimenting

with agent builders, particularly ones that help users automate

workflows. This aligns directly with our strategy to move from

conversation analysis to automated execution and will help me validate

concepts before engineering investment.
