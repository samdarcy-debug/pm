## **Metric Alignment**



**North Star Metric: Launch Copilot Workspace, Drive Upsells and

Renewals**



Pivoting from the original 'Workspaces' concept, my main focus in Q3 was

launching the next phase of Zoominfo\'s frontline seller experience as a

standalone application. We have successfully launched this to all

internal users and are beginning to sell internally



**Key Achievements:**



- **0-to-1 Product:** Launched a 0-to-1 net new product for frontline

  sellers, paving a strong foundation for a simplified, AI-native

  application. While Sales are heavily restricted, we have begun to see

  this app used to positively impact renewal conversations (*see image

  below)*



- **Chat / Agentic Foundations:** Integrated Chat into new application

  that paves the way for delivering on the promise of an AI-native

  application where the experience is dedicated by the user's context

  (much work to do in Q4/Q1 2026 to get there)

## **Key Learnings**



1.  **New competition**: While we are seeing consolidation in Sales-Tech

    our competition has stiffened. We are no longer just competing with

    Sales Intelligence tools - we are competing with Notion, ChatGPT. IF

    our app isn't truly best in class, there's less reason for users to

    bother with the application. While we as an org are hedging our bets

    with ZI data as a source for LLMs, integrations - this is an

    existential risk for our application. If it's not as frictionless

    and fit for purpose for frontline sellers - it need not exists.



2.  **Trust through explainability:** Users are wary of GenAI

    application's accuracy. Every claim must be easily cited to build

    trust. Even for internal users, if we return incorrect responses a

    few times, rebuilding trust is difficult.



3.  **Network Effects and Sharing:** To fully capitalize on the GenAI

    shift, we must build a platform that thrives on user collaboration

    and shared innovation. By fostering strong network effects, similar

    to what companies like Clay have achieved, we can establish

    Workspace as the indispensable platform for the GenAI era. This

    means prioritizing features that encourage sharing, community

    engagement, and the co-creation of valuable assets within the

    platform first at a tenant level, then ultimately cross-tenant.



## **Hypotheses & Results**



**Hypothesis 1: Benchmarking against competitors guarantees simplicity**



- **Expectation:** By benchmarking against best-in-class competitors for

  AE/AMs, we guarantee a "simple-enough" UX that will be easily

  understood by our users



- **Result: 🟡 Mixed --** Fundamental things like View creation,

  filtering, adding fields are a challenge for first time users. We must

  continually simplify the experience and move more towards a push

  motion where we pre-generate the right artifacts/views.



**Hypothesis 2: App vs. Chat Distinction**
