#### **Metric Alignment**



Supporting Renewals of Copilot:\

Supported the apps/Salesos team in prototyping some visionary workspace

roadmap ideas which helped align next 6-18months of the roadmap.

Workspaces & it's vision are a key driver of renewing the Copilot

customers.



#### **Key Learnings**



Even in my first few weeks at ZoomInfo, I\'ve realized how uniquely

positioned we are to become the central GTM platform --- far beyond

being a contact data provider. Our data moat (contacts, Chorus

transcripts, emails, intent signals, stakeholder movements, earnings

insights) powers the full spectrum of GTM rituals: SDR prospecting, AE

deal prep, forecast reviews, account planning, and expansion plays.

These signals drive both external execution (customer engagement) and

internal alignment (prioritization, coaching, planning). A single signal

like \"stakeholder leaving\" impacts both managers in forecast reviews

and reps managing renewals. Unifying these workflows in Copilot

Workspace reinforces that ZoomInfo can expand across the entire revenue

organization --- not just automating prospecting, but redefining how GTM

teams operate.



#### **Hypotheses & Results**



Hypothesis : Activity data is essential for GTM value



- Assumption: Email content and meeting transcripts are critical

  datasets for Copilot Workspace GTM use cases



- Result: Validated -- deal health evaluation, stall identification, and

  rep coaching all require this context



- Learning: For personas outside of AE/AMs, like management, activity

  data (emails/transcripts) is indispensable for understanding prior

  discussions, concerns, and objections which are core to the JTBD of

  Management and above personas



Hypothesis: Free-form prompting creates adoption barriers



- Assumption: GTM personas can effectively write prompts for complex

  tasks without AI experience



- Result: Confirmed -- Slack feedback showed users\' \"failed\" prompts

  weren\'t hitting product limitations but lacked sufficient detail and

  enough details in the prompt to get the product to work as expected.

  Sellers and managers don\'t have mental models for how AI interprets

  context and rarely use ChatGPT-like tools in daily workflows, making

  prompt construction a potential adoption challenge



- Learning: Invest in non-chat based prompting alongside chat-based

  experience



#### **Go-forward Changes & Plan**



**Build a proactive and personalized experience**



Continue to explore, prototype, and validate proactive and bre-built

experiences that deliver insights, data, and actionable insights

directly to users where and how they need it. This will help solve our

"users are not expert at writing prompts" and will also create a set of

hooks and value that keep users in our product and making it core to

their daily workflows.



#### **Leveraging AI**



**Replit to ideate quickly and tell compelling stories\**

In support of the roadmapping offsite that happened in early October, I

helped build prototypes that painted longer-term concepts for workspaces

like Forecasting, CRM updates, Opportunity Profile, and \"Pulse\"

notifications, using Replit to build these. Adam Severence had an

existing Replit that already had much of the look and feel for Workspace

built out, and in the space of \~24 hours, we were able to build six

really compelling and thorough prototypes to convey the vision. The

feedback was really positive, and this feels like the future of

roadmapping discussions. Especially when it comes to applications, we

should be prototype-first, as it\'s such a powerful way to convey

directional and broad ideas.\

Few examples:

\

For Prompting, it's as straightforward as just explaining in detail the

additions, using the planning step to plan first, then build. Really

impressed with Replit.\

**Leverage Cline to ramp up quickly on features/capability**



Lars recommended to explore repos using Cline and it's been super useful

to explore how engineering approached development on early features like

the slides artifacts.\

\

Used this prompt to summarize the features in a easy to understand way:
