#### **Metric Alignment**



\[TTV\] Time to first aha moment per user: implemented



\[Sustained Value\] % of repeat converters for 2-weeks over a 4-week

period



Data Fly Wheel



#### **Key Learnings**



"Just tell me what I should do with this account" was overwhelming

feedback on company profiles. Reps want relevant + targeted + actionable

insights right when they land on a profile.



Profiles serve as an anchor point for not just Zoominfo data but all

customer data (CRM, engagements). Anyone from the CEO to a CSM leverage

profiles to stay up to date across ZI and 1st party sources. Our new

workspace profiles will improve this visibility.



Early workspace usage shows that users don't truly understand the

capabilities of the product and how to get the most out of it. We really

need to nail FTUE + onboarding to create sticky adoption on day 1 but

more importantly this highlights the importance of recommendations in

the platform. Users shouldn't have to become view creation + prompt

experts to get the most out of the platform - we should be delivering

prioritized next best actions front and center.



The entire universe of SFDC data in workspace is overwhelming. Reps are

looking for clarity and simplicity in their data, blended with ours. We

need to be better at "cutting the CRM fat" in views.



Broad desire for mobile app - a lot of validation from users that mobile

serves a critical purpose in the daily lifecycle of a front-line seller

(particularly notifications, research+discovery, and recommendations).

We have a massive opportunity to create DAU level adoption of workspace

with Mobile. There are 4 key use cases that sellers need: (alerts,

targeted account research, daily planning and prep, and general

prospecting+exploration).



Recommended actions are not created equal - can't rely on a list of

target accounts and cookie cutter actions. Account scenario dictates

priority, and recommendations need to be hyper-specific and actionable

to a specific contact (s). Recency of conversation data is absolutely

critical (what was mentioned yesterday matters today). We also will

never have the context perfect enough to call them "next best" actions.



Agent first mindset - we've built a very robust agentic platform and

I've witnessed first hand how much more effective we can be at pushing

intelligent recommendations to our users with agents vs rigid APIs +

schemas (this doesn\'t mean we should use agents for everything).



AI-generated content alone isn't enough to stand out --- especially as

users grow increasingly skeptical of generic outputs. The winning

strategy is to make it easy for users to refine and personalize what AI

produces, blending efficiency with human creativity to create

thoughtful, distinctive content directly within the platform.



Overall I'm very pleased and proud with how Workspaces unfolded. It's

amazing to see how quickly we moved on Workspaces when everyone is

aligned on building the right thing for our customers with a definitive

timeline. However, we do need to manage resourcing more effectively as

there is noticeable burnout happening across the team. Long game matters

here.

#### **Hypotheses & Results**



Hypothesis: AI generated summaries are the best way to deliver company

and contact intelligence.



Learnings: Validated. Important to Know section has become the most

engaged with component on SalesOS profiles proving that users want

succinct summaries of intelligence, not disparate info that needs to be

strung together. Initial test of what's new toast on ReachOut showed

increased engagement and retention over signals notification. However

speed to surface is critical - streaming is a hard requirement (anything

over 2 seconds for a summary to generate results in churn).



Hypothesis: Recommended actions at the account level are not just

viable, but impactful on the agentic-platform



Learnings: Validated. Ran a several week POC with several enterprise

reps pressure testing NBA agent. Proved that we can truly deliver

actionable + relevant + targeted NBA's that reps can execute with

confidence - however, it's very clear that context is critical - for

NBA's to succeed we require 360 degree context particularly around CI.

Recency of conversation data is absolutely critical (what was mentioned

yesterday matters today).. Absolutely critical that we expand engagement

sources to slack + teams.



**Go-forward Changes & Plan**



*Outlook: Based on your learnings & insights, what will you prioritize

next quarter?*



Mobile V2: implement MVP of workspace mobile app



Recommendations: partner with [[Rowan

Bailey]{.underline}](mailto:rowan.bailey@zoominfo.com) and team to

ensure we have a sufficient account prioritization model and

recommendation engine with explainability across account scenarios and

jobs to be done. This is a key pre-requisite for nailing meaningful

recommendations.



Need to unify our notification + recommendation framework across

surfaces. It's key that we nail a seamless experience across desktop and

mobile.

#### **Leveraging AI**



Built the next best action agent from the ground up on the agentic

platform - iterating and evaluating over several weeks to bring an

impactful V1 to production for usage in workspace, reachout and mobile.



Rapid prototyping in Cline for Company Profiles, Mobile V2 and ReachOut



Deep research for validation - leverage multiple tools for competitive

analyses and product design.



Built a Jira agent in ZI chat to create and manage epics, stories, tasks

in natural language sharing with the product org.



In Q4 I plan to productionalize two agents for the workspace mobile app

("For you" agent which prioritizes actions across account scenarios, and

"Today" agent which prioritizes meeting prep, time sensitive actions,

etc). Also plan to build out key artifacts like territory map.
