#### **// Metric Alignment**



My Q3 initiatives directly impacted customer retention rate through two

major workstreams:



1.  Copilot Renewals Project (May-August): Led research that informed

    our renewal treatment strategy, resulting in renewal outcomes that

    exceeded original projections. While direct attribution is

    challenging to measure, the correlation between our research-driven

    approach and improved retention metrics suggests meaningful impact.



2.  Workspace Development: Early customer previews indicate strong

    alignment with key decision criteria for upcoming renewals.

    Customers report that Workspace addresses critical use cases within

    their evaluation frameworks, positioning it as a strategic lever for



#### **// Key Learning**



1.  Embedding engineering teams directly in the customer journey

    accelerates innovation but requires organizational change

    management.



    a.  The Workspace project demonstrated that when engineers deeply

        understand customer problems, we achieve faster velocity and

        better product-market fit. However, this startup-style approach

        creates tension with traditional enterprise development

        processes.



2.  Success requires balancing speed and autonomy with organizational

    alignment.



    a.  Teams operating outside standard processes must proactively

        manage stakeholder expectations and cross-functional

        dependencies. The discomfort is worth it -- interrogating our

        assumptions about scale development methodology is critical for

        maintaining competitive advantage.



#### **// Hypotheses & Results**



Hypothesis 1: \"Build it and they will adopt\"



- Assumption: A well-researched renewal strategy would be readily

  adopted by account management



- Result: Failed to achieve full buy-in due to lack of stakeholder

  involvement in strategy development



- Learning: Co-creation with sales teams is essential; we must build

  *with* them, not *for* them



Hypothesis 2: \"Minimal onboarding for familiar UX patterns\"



- Assumption: Users\' Excel familiarity would translate to immediate

  Workspace adoption



- Result: Our unique value prop (multi-source data + AI intelligence

  layer) requires more context than anticipated



- Learning: Novel capabilities need intentional user education, even

  within familiar interfaces



Hypothesis 3: \"Dual product challenges are manageable\"



- Assumption: Running Workspace alongside Copilot V1 would create

  confusion



- Result: Confirmed -- messaging complexity is impacting field

  effectiveness



- Learning: We need accelerated narrative development and clear

  migration pathways



#### **// Go-forward Changes & Plan**



Priority 1: Sales Enablement & Alignment



- Embed with sales to understand precise renewal and new deal levers



- Develop targeted enablement for Workspace as a renewal driver



- Focus on quick wins before tackling larger platform enhancements in H1



Priority 2: Strategic Competitive Positioning



- Exercise restraint in feature parity battles with Clari, Glean, and

  Scratchpad



- Focus on our unified intelligence advantage rather than point solution

  features



- Build confidence in saying \"no\" to maintain product coherence



Priority 3: Chat Excellence as Foundation



- Prioritize chat quality as the primary showcase for our GTM

  intelligence



- Ensure every product decision removes barriers to intelligence access



- Maintain focus: without exceptional chat, other features become

  irrelevant



#### **// Leveraging AI**



AI-First Development Approach:



- Prototyping: Shifted entirely to Repl.it for rapid iteration with our

  new design system, enabling real-time collaboration between product

  and engineering



- Process Optimization: Using ChatGPT voice mode for documentation and

  learnings synthesis, reducing administrative overhead by \~80%



- Product Philosophy: Building Workspace as an AI-native platform where

  users leverage intelligence rather than consume static insights



Next Quarter Focus: Expand our capability to surface unexpected insights

that delight users beyond their explicit requests -- true intelligence

augmentation rather than simple query response.
