#### **Metric Alignment**



My shortened Q3 work was primarily onboarding, with specific focus on

improving Early Access program effectiveness.



**Early Access Metrics Impact:**



During Q3, I established baseline tracking for the Early Access program

and identified key improvement opportunities:



- **PM Engagement:** Tracked releases going through Early Access, which

  ranged from 1-3 releases per month (averaging 1.75 releases/month in

  Q3), representing 5-15% of total monthly releases



- **Feedback Engagement:** Identified gaps in engagement

  measurement---metrics for \"# of People engaging in each chat\" and

  \"# of unique feedback instances\" were not yet being tracked.



**Q3 Improvement Focus:**



The baseline metrics revealed that while we had established partner

enrollment (136 people) and willingness to contribute, we had

inconsistent PM engagement (ranging from 4.76% to 15% of releases) and

participation from the feedback network. My Q4 work will focus on

addressing these gaps by:



- Developing processes to increase the % of releases leveraging Early

  Access



- Creating activation plans to improve feedback partner engagement



The Tier 1 project alignment and milestone work ensures R&D and GTM

teams are synchronized, which reduces delays and improves our ability to

hit committed delivery dates---ultimately supporting customer

satisfaction and retention metrics.



#### **Key Learnings**



**On Early Access Program Maturity:** The Early Access program had

strong foundational elements but lacked the activation and engagement

needed to deliver consistent value. Simply having a feedback network

isn\'t enough---we need proactive outreach, clear LRT identification

processes, and regular engagement rituals to make the program effective

for both product teams and feedback partners. It is also notable that

some number of PMs leverage feedback from partners without formally

going through Early Access. I will work with them to leverage the formal

process in addition to any current networks they use.



**On Cross-Functional Alignment:** Creating a single source of truth for

Tier 1 projects revealed significant alignment gaps between R&D and GTM

teams. Without clear, centralized milestone tracking, different

stakeholders operated with different assumptions about timing and

dependencies, creating downstream confusion and inefficiency.



**On Process Documentation and Operational Consistency:** The

preliminary work on developing a structured Annual Planning Process

revealed the need for standardized language, frameworks, and practices

that fit together into a cohesive operations structure. Without

consistent terminology and interconnected processes, practices lose

momentum and buy in is inconsistent. Creating documentation that

establishes common definitions and connects various operational

practices---from planning to execution to measurement---enables more

effective collaboration and reduces friction across the product

organization.



#### **Hypotheses & Results**



**Hypothesis 1: Establishing baseline metrics for Early Access

engagement would reveal opportunities to improve feedback quality and

program value.**



Result: Validated. By baselining engagement metrics in late September,

we identified that the feedback network wasn\'t being optimally

activated. Partners wanted to provide feedback but weren\'t being

proactively engaged with the right LRTs at the right time. This led

directly to developing an activation plan focused on in-person reviews

and establishing ongoing engagement processes.



**Hypothesis 2: More structured Early Access identification processes

would increase PM participation and improve release quality.**



Result: In progress. October process was similar to previous months. I

engaged more directly with PMs about Early Access, hoping to increase

engagement. This had limited impact - more PMs indicated they would

leverage the process, but almost every LRT ticket was pushed to the next

release.



**Hypothesis 3:** **Increased feedback partner engagement would lead to

better feedback quality and stronger PM utilization of the program.**



Result: Hypothesis formed late in Q3 with early validation work

beginning. The theory that more engagement → better feedback → more PM

engagement → better customer value is sound, but full results won\'t be

measurable until Q4 as we implement the activation plan developed in

late September.



**Hypothesis 4: Creating a comprehensive dependency map and milestone

tracker for Tier 1 projects would improve R&D and GTM alignment.**



Result: Weakly validated. The Tier 1 project tracking work (starting

late August through early September) demonstrated a lack of alignment by

surfacing key milestones. And its existence caused people to update me

when things changed, almost certainly improving alignment. The attempt

to identify "key dependencies" was not a big success. Stakeholder

engagement was pretty low and it was hard to identify the right level of

detail. Going forward, I think it will help if we leverage existing

processes (TPM motions) to source this information.



#### **Go-forward Changes & Plan**



**Q4 Priority 1: Operationalize the Annual Planning Process and

Structured Feedsback Loops.** Document the Annual (and semi-annual?)

Planning process framework (steps, deliverables, and glossary) and get

organizational buy-in. Define the structured roadmap performance

feedback loops we will leverage going forward (e.g., monthly metrics

review, QBR). Revitalize the delivery quality feedback loop of the

Product Review. This will provide the structured approach teams need to

make strategic decisions with confidence and clarity.



**Q4 Priority 2: Scale Early Access Program Impact.** Execute the

engagement activation plan developed in Q3 by partnering with EA

champions to drive their teams\' participation. Focus on demonstrating

tangible value to product teams and feedback partners to build

organizational muscle around the program. Continue refining the LRT

identification and timing processes to make participation seamless.

Continue investing in building community around Early Access and other

product operations initiatives. The most effective processes are ones

teams actually use and value, which requires ongoing communication,

support, and iteration based on feedback.



**Q4 Priority 4: Define Process to Maintain and Evolve Tier 1 Project

Tracking.** Build on the Q3 foundation by keeping the single source of

truth current and expanding dependency tracking as projects progress

through H2. Ensure this becomes a living tool rather than a one-time

deliverable, probably through a hand off to TPM organization.



**Q4 Stretch Goal:** **Reestablish Consistent Product Review Process.**

Develop and implement a standardized product review process that

leverages internal experts to improve product design and quality. This

would create systematic opportunities for cross-functional

expertise---from experienced PMs, designers, engineers, and domain

experts---to inform and elevate product decisions earlier in the

development cycle, ultimately delivering stronger customer experiences

through better design choices.



#### **Leveraging AI**



**Most Impactful Use Case:** I\'ve been using Claude to rapidly draft

process documentation and refine communication frameworks. For the

Annual Planning Process work, AI helped me quickly iterate on process

step descriptions and glossary definitions, turning rough concepts into

polished documentation that could be shared for feedback. This

compressed what might have been days of writing and editing into hours,

allowing me to focus more energy on stakeholder consultation and

refinement.



**Q4 Expansion Plans:** I plan to leverage AI more systematically for:



- **Early Access**



  - Identifying tickets that are good candidates for Early Access - I

    ran an initial test using AI to analyze LRTs and suggest which ones

    would benefit most from early feedback. The first run showed promise

    but wasn\'t perfect, indicating this could be a valuable tool with

    some refinement of the selection criteria and prompts



  - Calculating and Tracking Early Access metrics



- **Annual Planning and Feedback Rituals**



  - Refine Annual Planning and Feedback Ritual deliverables



  - \[maybe\] Create Agent to provide feedback on our feedback ritual

    deliverables



    - Metrics Analysis



    - QBR quality and action items
