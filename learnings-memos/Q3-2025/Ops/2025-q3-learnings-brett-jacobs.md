#### **Metric Alignment**



Delivered product marketing automation with significantly reduced

product marketing headcount through automation. (Relatively) smooth,

automated Monthly Release cycle demonstrated efficiency gains with

limited dropoff in quality. Shifting towards product concepts starting

with prototypes via Cline, has taken weeks off of translation time

between product, design, and engineering.



Can\'t yet measure field effectiveness of personalized GTM

materials-Copilot hasn\'t fully launched-but expect more efficient and

successful sales outcomes in Q4.



#### **Key Learnings**



**Context and curation determine AI quality more than model or prompt

sophistication.** Knowledge graph achieves solid baseline output with

minimal prompt tuning, but which documents feed the system drives actual

quality. This means knowledge management isn\'t purely

technical---requires human curation, clear ownership, and content

governance.



**Trusting our AI-first vision beats incremental improvement of old

processes.** Most people are using AI to do existing work faster. Our

team rethinks workflows in a new AI-first environment. When stakeholders

describe problems, trust our vision of ideal end state more than their

suggested solutions. Example: rather than speeding up talk track

creation, we rebuilt it as mass-personalized agents generating

account-specific positioning. This distinction---reimagining workflows

vs. accelerating old patterns---separates transformative work from

marginal gains.



**Outcome focus prevents implementation paralysis.** Spent too much time

on \"how\" questions before starting POCs, particularly knowledge base

architecture. The learning: define success criteria, build toward

outcome, let implementation emerge through iteration. Can\'t know right

architecture until testing with real usage. Ship POCs faster, learn from

actual usage, iterate based on reality rather than theoretical planning

debates.



#### **Hypotheses & Results**



**Hypothesis 1: We can deliver monthly releases with significantly

reduced headcount through automation**



***Result***: **True**. Delivered three consecutive smooth MCR cycles

with substantially smaller team. Process improvements created

sustainable workflows that reduced firefighting while maintaining

quality. Automation didn\'t just speed up old processes---enabled

execution at scale that wouldn\'t be possible with manual approaches

regardless of headcount.



***Learning***: Simplification drives compliance more than perfection

drives quality. Every additional requirement reduces completion rates.

Perfect documentation that doesn\'t get created has less value than good

documentation that ships consistently. This principle---systematic

simplification over comprehensive requirements---should guide all

process design.



**Hypothesis 2: Personalized GTM materials will be significantly more

effective for reps**



***Result***: **Unknown**. Products haven\'t fully launched yet, so

can\'t measure field effectiveness. Early indicators of high usage from

reps on Workspace Talk Track agent after training.



***Learning***: Delivering personalized capabilities solves

creation-at-scale problem but not adoption problem. Need help from the

experts on how tools integrate into rep workflows, not just whether they

function technically. This lesson applies beyond this specific

case---technical delivery is necessary but insufficient for business

impact.



**Hypothesis 3: Knowledge graph will enable systematic, consistent

product content**



***Result***: **True**. Relationship mapping across documents and

concepts delivers higher quality than direct document reference in

prompts. The outputs from the knowledge graph have delivered (better

than expected to be honest) success with a Marketing Agent capable of

generating a large of range of marketing assets that are all on-brand.

#### **Go-forward Changes & Plan**



**Deploy knowledge management.** Not just the technical system---the

ownership model and curation process. Context determines quality. Must

finish what we started in Q3, starting with key launches and expanding

from there



**Rebalance up-funnel of PDLC to roadmap and VoC.** Q3 focused on

release execution. Q4 needs to better balance: VOC driving

prioritization, rapid prototyping informing decisions. Speed up Cline's

capability to get "beta" ready in 1-2 days.



**Improve account-based selling through feedback loops.** Built

personalized talk tracks and demos for major launches. Real

effectiveness comes from continuous improvement---analyze talk track

sentiment, demo performance, customer questions, what\'s working. Use

VOC to refine assets in an AI-first way, not one-time creation.



...



#### **Leveraging AI**



**Most Impactful Q3 Use:** Automating monthly customer release process

via feature info pack, release notes, and avatar review allowed for

relatively smooth MCRs with significantly reduced headcount.
