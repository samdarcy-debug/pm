#### **Metric Alignment**



AI Action Credit used for AI Inferences in Copilot Workbooks and GTM

Studio



#### **Key Learnings**



With GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace requiring a new monetization

strategy to charge for AI usage that partnering with GTM teams earlier

would allow us to define the need for packaging and pricing systems

earlier and allow us to validate with customers in early access. With AI

Action Credits, we created a new usage-based currency to allow us to

pass on cost + markup, but we weren't able to validate customer value

and their willingness to pay, as packaging and pricing were one of the

last items to be developed. If we partnered with the GTM teams earlier,

we could create these systems earlier and test customer reaction

throughout the early access period to pivot to ensure we had the right

product-market fit. Additionally, decisions are being made late in

product launch around handling revenue modeling, revenue reporting, and

different contract flows that could have been created earlier in product

development, leading to a smoother product release and easier enablement

for sellers around how to talk about GTM Studio and Copilot Workspace.



#### **Hypotheses & Results**



1.  Creating a new AI Action Credit system to pass on cost + markup will

    allow us to monetize AI features.



    - **Result Validated:** Creating a centralized AI Credit system to

      convert different LLM costs and markups by agent to a common AI

      Action Credit currency has allowed us to monetize various agents

      across both Copilot Workspace and Workbook features. Looking at

      other companies in our space, we are seeing a movement from fixed

      cost to variable cost for AI features.



2.  Allowing margin to be set by the agent will allow us to maintain a

    mixed-use margin of 30-40% while still being competitively priced

    for commoditized features like AI Emailers



    - **Results Partially Validated**: Using models from early access

      customers and expected user behavior, we can tweak the margin of

      various agents to result in a margin across all AI use within our

      target goals. We do not know if customers \' usage patterns will

      follow, so we will need to continue monitoring and adjust to

      maintain margin goals.



3.  Creating usage-based currency will allow us to generate more revenue

    without creating "ACV bombs" like with our current data credit

    system



    - **Result Not** **Validated**: Since our current early access

      customers and internal sellers are not using AI Action Credits, we

      do not know if customers will use enough usage revenue to realize

      revenue at an equal or higher rate than if we increased the base

      seat price. In the future, including credit charging for early

      access customers will allow us better insight into customer

      behavior, whether they would continue to use the AI feature if

      they had to spend real currency.



#### **Go-forward Changes & Plan**



As we introduce new products that break away from our seat and data

credit monetization strategy, we need to work with the GTM groups early

to create the packaging and price structures to be able to sell these

products and test customer appetite during the early access program to

ensure a good product market fit. Additionally, Product Managers should

be thinking about monetization when creating features, so we can reduce

the friction of bringing new features to market and monetizing them.



#### **Leveraging AI**



- Creating AI pricing allowed for directly asking LLMs how they price

  their use for both corporate and personal use.



- Utilized AI to aggregate price models from various sales tools to

  replace manual research to create market comparisons.



- Expanding on AI use in the coming quarter, leverage AI to create a

  dynamic margin system to modify the markup rate for different agents

  to maintain target margins of 30-40% across all agents without having

  to manually analyze usage patterns.
