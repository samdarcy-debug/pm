#### **Metric Alignment**



AI Action Credit used for AI Inferences in Copilot Workbooks and GTM

Studio



#### **Key Learnings**



There is significant revenue-generating potential with the variable

markup strategy for AI actions. This gives Product Managers granular

control over revenue generation within their specific product areas,

allowing for continuous optimization of the underlying AI agents while

adjusting markups to be responsive to customer demand and the perceived

value of each action.



#### **Hypotheses & Results**



1.  We need an action credit dashboard at launch to actively monitor the

    costs and profit generated by different AI actions.



    a.  **Proven:** This dashboard has already proved essential for

        monitoring profitability and as a core mechanism for Engineering

        teams to compare actual versus estimated costs, immediately

        flagging anomalies or opportunities for efficiency adjustments.



2.  We don't need usage insight in-product immediately, customers can

    ask their AMs for a report.



    a.  **Disproven:** There is so much apprehension around AI spend

        that it will be very difficult to sell to a customer without

        giving them a self-service way they can monitor their usage.



3.  A change management plan is required to migrate GTM Studio EA

    customers to the new AI action credit model.



    a.  **Proven:** Early Access customers have established complex and

        high-usage workbooks. Their existing usage baseline indicates

        they will require AI action credits beyond standard recurring

        plans. This validation requires a right-sizing strategy to

        transition them successfully and mindfully into the appropriate

        long-term package.



#### **Go-forward Changes & Plan**



In Q4, will kick off a monthly AI Monetization Council to regularly

review the action credits dashboard, analyze usage patterns, and make

proactive, data-driven adjustments to markups and pricing models. The

council will also help with prioritization decisions on the AI Action

Credit roadmap. First on our list is introducing user recurring credits

for Copilot Workspace, which will help incentivize seller usage of AI.



**Leveraging AI**



Using staging data, I built a calculator to help us determine how to

scale the production database for AI Action Credits.
