# Weekly Synthesis Analysis Constraints

This file contains strategic framework definitions, team ownership mapping, analysis rules, and quality standards for generating weekly synthesis reports.

## Strategic Framework for Analysis

Organize your synthesis around these strategic areas:

**GTM Studio (Sneh):** GTM Studio is ZoomInfo's data unification and AI-powered activation platform that consolidates fragmented data from CRM systems, ZoomInfo's database, and external sources into workbooks, enabling revenue teams to build targeted audiences and activate insights across their entire go-to-market tech stack. The team is run by Sneh Kakileti and has work related to Workbooks, Plays, ROI, GTM Configuration, and Data Management.

**GTM Workspace (Victor):** GTM Workspace is ZoomInfo's AI-powered workspace that transforms how sales teams manage their entire revenue motion by providing a familiar spreadsheet-like interface where accounts are automatically prioritized, natural language commands generate account plans and renewal strategies, and all interactions sync with CRM in real-time—extending beyond prospecting to cover deal strategy, renewal planning, and expansion execution. The team is run by Victor Oliveros.

**GTM AI Context Service (Adam/Rowan):** GTM Context Service is ZoomInfo's intelligence layer that grounds any AI system (ChatGPT, custom agents, Copilot) with real-time GTM data from CRM, conversations, market signals, and competitive intelligence, transforming generic AI responses into account-specific, attributed answers that drive revenue outcomes. The team is run by Rowan Bailey and is made up of the Semantic Data Team, Context Engineering Team, and MCP Team.

**Vertical Datasets (Dow Jones):** These are custom datasets that can be sold directly to customers to better help them identify potential customers. This is led by Dow Jones whose updates can be found in Brandon Tucker's Data Team Report.

**Other Data (Brandon):** All other Data teams fall under Brandon Tucker's organization. This includes the Data Executive Team and the Core Data Team run by Jody Roberts that covers the contributory network and other core ZoomInfo data.

**Other Platform (Ali):** The Platform team is run by Ali Sadat and his team also is responsible for the Integrations team (Andres Perez's team), Admin team (Brannen Huske's team), Automation team (Marc Frail's team), ZIM team (Anwar Mai's team), and the Data Platform team (Marc Delurgio's team).

**Operations (AJ/Brett):** These include AJ Belen's teams (BI team and PMM teams) as well as Brett Jacobs's team (Product Ops team).

## Team Ownership Mapping

Map team reports to strategic categories as follows:

- **GTM Studio (Sneh)**: GTM Studio team reports (Sneh Kakileti's team)
- **GTM Workspace (Victor)**: GTM Workspace team reports (Victor Oliveros's team)
- **GTM AI Context Service (Adam/Rowan)**: Semantic Data team, Context Engineering team, MCP team reports (Rowan Bailey's teams)
- **Vertical Datasets (Dow Jones)**: Pull the full paragraph update from Brandon Tucker's Data Team report that reports on the progress that Dow Jones has made on the Vertical Datasets initiative
- **Other Data (Brandon)**: Data Team reports (Brandon Tucker's team, Jody Roberts's Core Data team)
- **Other Platform (Ali)**: Platform team, Integrations team (Andres Perez), Admin team (Brannen Huske), Automation team (Marc Frail), ZIM team (Anwar Mai), Data Platform team (Marc Delurgio)
- **Other Operations (AJ/Brett)**: BI team and PMM teams (AJ Belen), Product Ops team (Brett Jacobs)

**CRITICAL Requirements:**
- Pull FULL executive summaries without truncation. Do not summarize or shorten them.
- Each executive summary should be on its own line (separated by a blank line from the next summary)
- Bold the team name before each executive summary: **Team Name:**
- If no reports fall into a particular category, do not feel the need to fill it
- The DAI report may not fit nicely into any bucket. Please bucket it how you see fit
- Use direct quotes from teams rather than synthesizing their reports

## Analysis Approach

- Identify patterns across teams that require leadership attention - look for the same issues, blockers, or opportunities appearing in multiple team reports, but be sure to not double count issues as it often is the same person joining multiple team meetings and bringing up the same blockers.

- Surface blockers that need executive intervention or resource allocation - distinguish between isolated issues and systemic problems. Make sure they are different individuals reporting on these blockers as some individuals may join multiple team meetings.

- Highlight cross-team dependencies and collaboration opportunities.

- Connect team execution to strategic progress without over-analyzing.

- Focus on what leadership needs to know and coordinate on THIS WEEK.

- **Critical: Prioritize based on strategic relevance to the transformation goals, not just urgency of language. Pull full executive summaries directly from team reports rather than synthesizing - let the teams' own words demonstrate progress, patterns, and blockers.**

- When identifying patterns, use full executive summaries from multiple team reports that show the same issue or success. Do not truncate the executive summaries.

## Communication Style

- Direct, actionable language appropriate for CPO + VP staff coordination
- Use specific team member names and concrete examples
- Quantify impact where possible
- Distinguish between information (what happened) and intelligence (what it means for decisions)
- Balance transparency about challenges with constructive path forward

## Tone and Language Guidelines

- Avoid hyperbolic language unless explicitly used in source documents
- Frame issues as systemic problems or resource constraints, not team failures
- Use constructive language focused on solutions and coordination needs
- Let team executive summaries speak for themselves without editorial commentary

## Quality Standards

1. **No Truncation**: Always pull FULL executive summaries and context
2. **Direct Quotes**: Use direct quotes or very close paraphrases from team reports
3. **Constructive Tone**: Maintain a professional, constructive tone (avoid hyperbole)
4. **Strategic Filter**: Focus on what's strategically relevant to Q2 2025 transformation
5. **Accurate Attribution**: Always bold team names when attributing information: **Team Name:**
6. **Proper Formatting**: Use `<br><br>` separators in tables, not bullets
7. **Executive Summary Separation**: Each executive summary on its own line, separated by blank line
8. **Exclude DAI from Tables**: Do NOT include DAI Executive Team report in analysis tables
9. **Correct Column Names**: Use exact column names specified for both tables
10. **Team-Specific Content Only**: For Table 2, only include what OTHER teams say about each domain
