## Q2 2025 Strategic Memo

### Strategic Focus: GTM Intelligence Platform

**Key Metric**: Contextual data velocity - how fast we can enrich and deliver relevant context to power intelligent GTM work.

### Where We Play

1. **Interface-agnostic intelligence**: Not just Copilot - intelligence anywhere GTM work happens
2. **Mission-critical GTM jobs**: Focus on jobs that directly impact revenue (prospecting, outreach, deal management)
3. **Purpose-built apps**: Studio agents and workflows that solve specific GTM problems end-to-end

### How We Make Money

1. **Data Foundation**: Records under management (company, contact, technographic, intent data)
2. **Agentic Work**: AI credits consumed for agent actions, enrichment, and intelligence
3. **SaaS Licenses**: Traditional seat-based licensing for Copilot and platform access
4. **Custom Datasets**: Vertical-specific and custom data products (healthcare, financial services, etc.)

### 18-Month Customer Outcomes

**RevOps Teams**:
- Running 20+ intelligent plays continuously
- Automated prospecting, enrichment, and routing
- Real-time territory management and account assignment

**Sales Representatives**:
- Copilot as "Bloomberg Terminal for GTM"
- Every interaction contextually enriched
- Proactive intelligence surfaced at point of need

**Revenue Leaders**:
- Predictable execution across the revenue engine
- Real-time visibility into pipeline health and activity
- Data-driven decision making on coverage and resource allocation

### Operational Gaps to Close

1. **Democratize agent creation**: Make it easy for any user to create purpose-built agents (not just technical users)
2. **Eliminate incrementalism**: Stop building features, start building complete job solutions
3. **Compress cycle times to daily**: Move from quarterly releases to daily value delivery

### Priority Investments (Q2 2025)

- **GTM Studio**: Working production instances at 50+ customer accounts
- **Live Agents**: 15+ production agents running in customer environments
- **Vertical Datasets**: 5+ new vertical-specific datasets (healthcare, financial services, technology, etc.)
- **Context API**: Real-time enrichment and intelligence APIs at scale
- **Agent Marketplace**: Curated marketplace of pre-built agents and workflows

## Analysis Guidelines

### What Makes a Good Blocker/Challenge for the Summary Table?

✅ **Include**:
- Affects multiple teams
- High strategic impact (blocks Q2 priority investment)
- Recurring pattern across weeks
- Requires executive intervention or cross-team coordination
- Risk to customer outcomes or commitments

❌ **Exclude**:
- Single-team tactical issues
- Already resolved or with clear mitigation
- Low strategic relevance
- Normal course of business challenges

### What Makes Good "Relevant Context" for the Context Table?

✅ **Include**:
- Progress on Q2 priority investments
- Customer wins or feedback
- Launches or milestones
- Cross-team dependencies or collaboration
- Strategic pivots or decisions
- Metrics that show velocity or health

❌ **Exclude**:
- Routine updates without strategic significance
- Internal process changes (unless impact strategic goals)
- Individual contributor updates (focus on team-level)

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone
- **Professional**: Executive-level audience (CPO, VP Product Management)
- **Constructive**: Focus on problems and solutions, not blame
- **Direct**: Clear and concise, no corporate jargon or fluff
- **Data-driven**: Use metrics and specific examples when available

### Language
- Avoid hyperbole ("amazing", "incredible", "game-changing")
- Use precise language ("increased by 15%" not "improved significantly")
- Direct quotes from team reports when possible
- Active voice preferred over passive voice

### Attribution
- Always bold team names: **Team Name:**
- Use team names, not individual names (unless executive-level person)
- Clear attribution for all claims and updates

---

## Common Synthesis Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Truncating summaries**: Always pull FULL executive summaries, never summarize them further
2. **Losing attribution**: Every claim needs a team name attribution
3. **Using bullets in tables**: Use `<br><br>` separator, not markdown bullets
4. **Editorializing**: Report what teams said, don't add your own spin
5. **Mixing levels of detail**: Keep executive summaries high-level, details in appendix
6. **Ignoring strategic filter**: Everything should relate to Q2 2025 priorities
7. **Missing cross-team patterns**: Look for themes across multiple teams
